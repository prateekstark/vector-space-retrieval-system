 The producers of a Broadway play about arms control negotiations brought their performance to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night, where it was viewed by an appreciative audience that included the secretary of state and two men involved in such talks. `` It bore no resemblance to reality, that's what made it so good,'' said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> after viewing `` A Walk in the Woods.'' `` It was a good characterization and a lot of laughs,'' he said. The play, starring <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> as the American negotiator and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> as his Soviet counterpart, was performed in the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> auditorium, across the street from the Capitol. A dozen senators, having just finished a day of debate about the U.S.-Soviet medium-range arms control treaty, were among the 250 people who attended the play, along with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> was the American who formed the basis of <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON>'s character, while <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> was the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator on the medium-range missile treaty <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` It did n't bear any relationship to anything we talked about,'' said <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>. `` It's a dramatization, and while it's good, it's not like reality,'' said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>. The play, a black comedy, is based on <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>'s 1982 private talk with <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvitsinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>'s Soviet counterpart. That discussion produced an agreement between the two men on the framework for a medium-range missile treaty, but the plan was later rejected by both governments. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought the production `` dramatizes the human side of what is too often a faceless bureaucracy.'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> was one of the hosts for the play, which was performed by <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> on their day off.

<TEXT>
 The medieval fantasy `` Willow,'' a $ 55 million gamble in an often-disastrous film genre, found an audience and box office figures Monday show moviemaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> apparently has another hit on his hands. `` Willow,'' released early to avoid first-week competition from certain blockbusters `` Crocodile Dundee II'' and `` Rambo III,'' was the nation's top-grossing film in its debut weekend with an $ 8.3 million take. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said he was buoyed by the figures and was confident `` Willow'' could maintain its box office appeal despite the two sure-fire sequels that will flood 2,000 screens each on Wednesday. `` Willow'' surpassed the opening weekend business of `` Raiders of the Lost Ark'' -LRB- $ 8.26 million in June 1981 -RRB- and `` Top Gun'' -LRB- $ 8.19 million in May 1986 -RRB-, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said. In addition to high expectations from `` Star Wars'' creator <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and `` Cocoon'' director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, `` Willow'' has received interest because of the amount of money it cost to make the film over a two-year period. It also comes after two expensive <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> flops _ `` Labyrinth'' and `` Howard the Duck.'' One `` Willow'' critic recently called it `` <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> the Duck.'' <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who monitors box office trends for <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION>, noted that only five motion pictures in history have ever done $ 8 million-plus during May's traditional pre-Memorial Day holiday movie slump. Other Top 10 films pulled in considerably less during the weekend. Last week's top performer, `` Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood,'' took in $ 3.43 million to place second in the latest sweepstakes. It made almost as much as `` Willow'' in its debut with an $ 8.2 million take on 1,796 screens. In third was `` Colors'' with $ 2.9 million, followed by `` Beetlejuice'' with $ 2.7 million and `` Shakedown'' in fifth with $ 1.2 million. In `` Willow,'' the main character lives in a village of little people and finds a baby floating in the river, but it's a special baby who will threaten the throne of the evil Queen <PERSON> Bavmorda </PERSON>. The queen orders her warriors to find and kill the baby and the story revolves around the perilous trek to a castle sanctuary. `` Willow,'' which opened Friday at 1,024 theaters nationwide with little enthusiasm from reviewers, is the latest effort from <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, whose `` Star Wars'' and `` Indiana Jones'' films have grossed $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reviewer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehr </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>: `` In ` Willow,' the Force has left him. He's imitating himself and he's moping while he does it. Daily Variety termed the film `` a medieval mishmash'' but predicted `` kids will probably love it.'' The Hollywood Reporter praised the production values but complained the storyline `` never really kicks into overdrive.'' Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor Relations with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross, number of weeks in release, and estimated production costs when available. 1. `` Willow,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 8.31 million, 1,024 screens, $ 8,106 per screen, $ 8.3 million, one week, n-a. 2. `` Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood,'' Paramount, $ 3.43 million, 1,796 screens, $ 1,912 per screen, $ 13.24 million, two weeks, n-a. 3. `` Colors,'' <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.94 million, 1,388 screens, $ 2,122 per screen, $ 34.4 million, six weeks, $ 12 million. 4. `` Beetlejuice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2.72 million, 1,546 screens, $ 1,764 per screen, $ 58,8 million, eight weeks, $ 20 million. 5. `` Shakedown,'' Universal, $ 1.22 million, 938 screens, $ 1,703 per screen, $ 8.12 million, three weeks, n-a. 6. `` Moonstruck,'' <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.17 million, 771 screens, $ 1,525 per screen, $ 73.97 million, 23 weeks, $ 17 million. 7. `` Above The Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.14 million, 715 screens, $ 1,604 per screen, $ 17.45 million, seven weeks, $ 14 million. 8. `` Salsa,'' Cannon, $ 1.13 million, 757 screens, $ 1,510 per screen, $ 6.79 million, three weeks, n-a. 9. `` <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blues </LOCATION>,'' Universal, $ 1.12 million, 876 screens, $ 1,282 per screen, $ 39.3 million, nine weeks, $ 16 million. 10. `` The Last Emperor,'' <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 930,729, 792 screens, $ 1,175 per screen, $ 40.29 million, 27 weeks, $ 25 million.

 A 19-year-old student from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> who studied in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was crowned Miss Universe of 1988 in a flashy competition on this <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> island Tuesday morning. <PERSON> Porntip </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakhirunkanok </PERSON>, a black-haired <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> resident, won $ 250,000 in cash and prizes, including a sports car and mink coat. She wiped away tears of joy and joined her hands together in a Thai sign of thanks after winning. The first runner-up was <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yunjung </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>. She was followed by Miss <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivares </PERSON>; Miss <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mizuho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakaguchi </PERSON>; and Miss <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeung </PERSON>. Sixty-six women had competed. Among the 10 semi-finalists was Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Nakhirunkanok </PERSON>, who weighs 114 pounds and stands 5 feet 8 inches tall, was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. She said during the program that she owed her English-speaking ability to <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> on the `` Sesame Street'' children's program. Organizers of the 37th Miss Universe pageant estimated 600 million people in 57 countries watched the televised competition for a successor to the 1987 Miss Universe, <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolocco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The program was filmed at 9 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT Monday -RRB- from a 9,000-seat sports stadium in a <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> suburb so <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers could watch during prime time Monday evening. The schedule forced the local audience to don tuxedos and evening attire at an hour more appropriate for reading the morning newspaper over a bowl of cereal. The live broadcast seen in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was briefly interrupted with a bulletin for a civil defense emergency exercise in the central island. Missing from this year's festivities was long-time host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, who resigned after last year's competition in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to protest the use of furs. He was replaced by television personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON>. Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s leaders, who viewed the competitions as an extravagance for a poor nation and were dismayed by reports that a Miss <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> winner performed strip dances in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The island has since emerged as one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most prosperous countries, and authorities lifted the ban last year to clear the way for a domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant. There is lingering opposition from a few groups, including retired soldiers who view beauty contests as an insult to mothers. But the telecast generally was seen in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as an opportunity to present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the official name of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> seldom used internationally because most countries recognize the rival communist Chinese government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Organizers pledged to refer to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as the Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the telecast and promised the two-hour program would have about 30 minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the contestants at scenic spots in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The Miss Universe pageant generated much interest in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> but was pushed into the background Friday when the island's most violent anti-government protest in recent years broke out in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. The 18-hour street battle between protesters and police left more than 200 people injured. Nearly 100 demonstrators were detained. Prizes for the 1988 Miss Universe include $ 76,000 in cash, a Maserati convertible automobile, and a mink coat and mink jacket. The 11 judges include <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeana </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, who made history with their round-the-world flight aboard the Voyager two years ago, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttan </PERSON> of the television series `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> is making money and enemies at both ends of the 275-foot-long contraption he runs near this town of oil men and shrimp boats. His hazardous waste kiln at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION> _ big as a football field with a smokestack 140 feet high _ is a high-profile presence on the flat southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> horizon. It's also a target of two groups that want to shut it down: some local residents who suspect it's dangerous and business competitors who accuse the company of skirting environmental regulations. Marine Shale, which employs about 240 people, denies the claims and insists that it cooperates fully with regulators. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, the debate centers on whether <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s contraption is an incinerator, which must meet one set of regulations, or a recycling plant, required to meet others. Kent charges $ 200 to $ 300 per 50-gallon drum to take in hazardous wastes from the companies that make them, ranging from glues to various petroleum by-products, but excluding PCBs, dioxins, asbestos, explosives, mercury compounds or disease-carrying materials. He receives 720 tons a day. He heats the waste to about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 -LCB- hours while running it through a whirling kiln that looks like an elongated cement mixer. He sells the resulting aggregate as material for road beds and parking lots. He has about 10 customers so far. If <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s claims about its process and product are found valid by state and federal officials examining the company's operations, it could render competitors' incinerators obsolete while revolutionizing the way a growing national hazardous waste disposal problem is handled It could also be very lucrative for Marine Shale. Company attorney and vice president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> says a patent is being sought for part of the process and licensing arrangements will follow. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> likes to say that incinerators create hazardous waste for storage in landfills, while <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> eliminates it in the creation of a product. At <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, next to <PERSON> Bayou </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeuf </PERSON>, conveyors lift piles of various materials _ some sludgy, some solid and some that serve as their own fuel _ into a huge rotating cylinder. Cameras at both ends monitor the inside of the kiln, which looks like <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>'s vision of hell, red hot with glowing embers and tumbling debris. A computer keeps tabs on temperature, gases and pressure, shutting down the operation if anything goes awry, according to <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>. Earlier this year <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> gave members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> clear plastic letter openers containing a small amount of the aggregate in the handle. The public relations gimmick prompted <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, lobbyist for a trade group representing competitors, to write to the lawmakers and urge them to contact the Capitol's safety engineer `` to arrange for the transportation of this material to a permitted facility for proper disposal. `` Sure, we did it,'' acknowledged <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. He contends the Marine Shale product is dangerous. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> says envy motivates the Treatment Council. He's charging less than half what his competitors do to take in hazardous waste, and then turns it into a product that sells for $ 1 a ton. `` It makes them sad,'' he says sardonically. The <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has joined South Louisianians Against Pollution, or SLAP, to fight Marine Shale. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, head of SLAP, says she opposes <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> because she believes, admittedly without evidence, that the company may be a factor in the area's unsually high cancer rate. `` Personally, I think they're contributing to it,'' she said. SLAP and <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>'s group have threatened a federal suit to try to halt <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s operations. The battle has spread to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, D-La., attacked the company in April in a subcommittee hearing, suggesting that laws might be needed to close loopholes that allow <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> to operate without an incinerator permit <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> was acting on behalf of his friend <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadhurst </PERSON>, whose law firm has represented <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member. <PERSON> Broadhurst </PERSON> is the attorney and lobbyist who accompanied former presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> on the ship `` Monkey Business'' with <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> labeled <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>'s suggestion ridiculous. The 140-foot emissions stack at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> puts out a steady plume of vapor, which the company says is clean. Water used to `` scrub'' the gases of particles that might pollute the air is re-used in the process, he said. Emissions pass through a `` bag house,'' where, according to <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>, they are filtered through more than a thousand bags, resembling vacuum cleaner bags, before release into the air. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> stressed that none of the water from the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> process is discharged into the bayou. He cited state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> records showing that traditional incinerators, such as the one run by <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, contaminate `` scrub'' water that must be treated before it is discharged into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a source of drinking water for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and other communities. About 1,750 companies that generate hazardous materials in 42 states ship them to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, according to spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON>. The materials are tested to ensure that they can be safely put in Marine Shale's kiln, he said.

The Bay Bridge Walk, which began at 9 a.m. and was completed by 5:30 p.m., drew 15,000 more people this year than last year's record, in part because Sunday was one of the first warm weekend days in what has been a rainy, cool spring The first annual walk was in 1975. `` I'm out here every year because it's here,'' said <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s resident <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> `` Why you walk across a bridge is the same reason you climb a mountain _ because it's there.''

 We have a pretty good idea what remarkable images Americans will see during the upcoming <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit: <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> toasted in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, embracing dissidents and <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION>, chatting with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> monks, talking shop with Russian filmmakers. Not to mention <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> at the Monument to the Defenders in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. To capture this presidential tour de force, there will be more American TV technicians in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than spies and diplomats combined. What with the eight-hour time difference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appearances will be beamed back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in plenty of time for morning newscasts. Breakfast at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>? This will be breakfast at the Hall of Facets. But what about the Soviet people? What will Gostelradio, the Soviet radio-and-television monopoly, show of the summit? <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the refuseniks lead off Vremya -LRB- the evening news -RRB-? Already, Soviet TV has taped a interview with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for broadcast on Friday. But it was a simple `` talking head'' session, 30 minutes of question-and-answer _ with none of the adventure or significance of next week's <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tours around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. American experts believe Soviet television will broadcast excerpts from the president's address at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION>, as well as ceremonial exchanges between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the Kremlin. If there are agreements to be signed, the klieg lights will be set up in <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>'s Hall. And surely there will be footage from the Bolshoi, where the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> host the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> for a 90-minute ballet sampler. But will Soviet officials air highlights from the <LOCATION> Danilov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will discuss religious freedom with monks who work restoring Orthodox icons? How much will be broadcast from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dialogue on artistic freedom with Soviet intellectuals at the Union of Writers club? And what of the first lady's visit to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> _ will she be shown touring the Hermitage, much as <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was shown on American TV touring the Smithsonian galleries? Just what images will Glasnost permit? Will Soviet television let <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>? ` It'll be very interesting to see what they show on television the week before the summit,'' former Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said last week, wondering whether <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON> will `` show the bum on the grate.'' Soviet TV loves to broadcast pictures of hapless vagabonds reduced to sleeping on the heat grates near the White House; it's a sad and pathetic side of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream and many viewers of Soviet TV probably have come to believe it's an accurate snapshot of life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But certainly something is afoot on the Gostelradio side of Glasnost. Just last week, Soviet TV viewers got a glance of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> performance, a glimpse of a Visa card and a sales pitch for the quality of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> TVs. Never mind that you ca n't get a <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> TV in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>. Commercials for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> were aired last week in the midst of a five-part Soviet series on life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Estimated audience: 120 million people. `` I expect we might get some angry letters from people saying, ` Why are you advertising <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> TVs when we ca n't buy any?''' TV personality <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said at a news conference announcing his series. To hear him tell it, the decision to air the commercials was less Glasnost than Perestroika -LRB- the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> campaign for economic reform -RRB-. `` We on our part can make some money out of this, which in our day and age when we are becoming economically self-supportive and self-sufficient, also makes sense,'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> said. Reports in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the Soviet broadcast agency Gostelradio received $ 10,000 for each 30-second ad. Profit motive. That's the American way.

 The Soviet decision to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is more than a life-saving step. It has rescued <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> from another `` leave-the-Afghans-alone'' lecture from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. As the leaders prepare for their fourth summit, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2, the first <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units have come home to <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and the Soviets seem determined to meet a February 1989 deadline for the removal of all 115,000 troops. The erasure of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as the topmost regional issue at the summit will give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> more time to push <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> toward settlements in other global hot spots _ <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. At least for now, `` there has been a resolution, or at least the formula for resolving the Afghan issue,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state for political affairs and head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team preparing for the summit discussion of regional issues. `` At the summit there just is n't that much more to say to them, except perhaps, ` thanks' and ` keep up the good work,''' said another <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. This official, and <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> as well, suggested, however, that Afghan issues could re-emerge as a summit topic because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are still actively engaged in the settlement process as the Soviets wind down their eight-year war. `` In terms of military arrangements, one of our biggest concerns is that they take out whatever minefields they have sown over the past eight years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` This is an issue of safety for civilians coming back to their villages.'' Earlier this year, before the Soviets signed a pledge to withdraw their troops, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beseeched <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to take the further step of ceasing military assistance to the government headed by Afghan leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would stop giving military support to the mujahadeen, the anti-Soviet resistance fighters, matching Soviet restraint with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restraint. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rejected the proposal and on May 14, the Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> announced he would leave behind up to $ 1 billion in arms and installations for use by the Afghan army. `` That does n't strike me as a demonstration of tremendous restraint,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said. He reiterated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to keep helping the guerrillas and said, bluntly, `` we'll have practical ways of accomplishing that purpose.'' Asked if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might seek <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s help in getting the resistance to let the Russian troops retreat home without being harried by attacks, <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said the Soviets would do better by seeking `` local arrangements'' with mujahadeen leaders. Though these issues remain, the fundamental decision to withdraw and evidence last week that the agreement is being carried out, removed an irritant that has nagged U.S.-Soviet relations since December 1979, when <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces entered what had been a civil war. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> protested the invasion by keeping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team home from the 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> games and he embargoed grain sales to the Soviets. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> resumed the grain deals, but he made clear that better U.S.-Soviet relations hinged to a large extent on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s willingness to pull its troops home from the Afghan conflict Indeed, before his met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985, in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> in 1986 and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987, he devoted speeches to the issue and signaled his intention to berate the Soviet leader about <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when they met. For example, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> eight days before the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` It's time for them to pack up, pull out and go home. It's time that they set a date certain for the complete withdrawal of all Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it appeared that even the Soviets were writing off the current regime in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets pride themselves on recognizing objective reality. Well, it's time for them to bite the bullet.'' By contrast, two weeks before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, the White House found itself praising Soviet actions, calling the pullout `` a welcome first step.''

 When the government threatened to close The Weekly Mail, the newspaper responded in typically irreverent fashion: it printed a rat-faced caricature of the government minister who issued the warning. Since its birth in 1985, The Weekly Mail has been a combative government opponent, winning staunch friends and making plenty of enemies, but never losing its sense of humor. Its aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary have earned it the nickname `` The Weekly Wail,'' and many consider it the best-written newspaper in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The newspaper has a circulation of only 22,000, and most of the readers are well-off white liberals. Its prominent backers range from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which places a full-page ad in each issue supporting press freedom or urging political reform `` Three years ago, we felt the tradition of aggressive, critical newspapers was being lost,'' said co-editor <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>. `` Our role has been to pursue in-depth coverage of the townships and politics and take a more strident stance against censorship.'' The government repeatedly has attacked The Weekly Mail as part of the `` alternative media'' that `` fans revolution'' and promotes outlawed organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has complained about numerous articles in The Weekly Mail, issued two official warnings against the newspaper and threatened to close it for three months. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> already has suspended two newspapers aimed at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority _ New Nation and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The Weekly Mail is one of five more papers that have received warnings. `` <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> warned us ... that our wailing threatens public safety,'' The Weekly Mail said in an editorial on its front page. `` We deny the charge. Our newspaper kicks at consciences and tears down barriers. It does not throw bombs.'' `` Do n't let us go quietly. Carry on reading us. Carry on subscribing. Make a fuss. Wail, dammit,'' the editorial said. Despite threats of closure, the newspaper continues to pursue controversial stories critical of the government and its system of apartheid, which prohibits blacks from having a voice in national affairs. Recent articles have challenged government casualty figures for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> fighting the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war; suggested South African agents were behind the killings of <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> officials abroad; examined the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a report from the group's headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>; and provided a detailed account of a black activist who allegedly was kidnapped and assaulted by the army. `` We've managed to put issues on the agenda that were n't being covered by the larger papers,'' said <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>. While the newspaper focuses on serious political issues, it regularly finds room for lighter matters. It is the only South African newspaper to run the American comic strip Doonesbury, and it has lively culture and sports sections, often written with an acid wit. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> junior-lightweight champion who must fight abroad to have his bouts officially sanctioned, is described by the paper as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s `` only diplomat with clout.'' After a white South African sprinter ran 100 meters in 10.06 seconds, newspapers and the state-run television network checked the record books and proclaimed him the `` world's fourth fastest white man.'' A Weekly Mail columnist responded: `` My next sporting goal is to become the seventh-fastest, gray-bearded, pink-freckled, left-eyed, sexagenarian, tanned-but-white hurdler over four meters ... Glory beckons.'' When a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> field hockey team competed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a `` mystery team'' to avoid criticism for boycott-busting, other newspapers protected its anonymity. But The Weekly Mail's staffer attended a game and reported that knowledgable fans were preoccupied with the weather, repeatedly saying, `` Chilly.'' Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, describes <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>'s political coverage as `` stylish, sophisticated, frequently clever, and aimed at an elite market.'' The weekly paper posed no threat to public safety because it is aimed at the `` gentlest, least violent, most anxious, guilt-ridden, sweetly intentioned middle class,'' a Business Day editorial said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> -RRB- and his advisers have neither the general education, nor the wit, to distinguish between revolution and radical chic,'' it added. <PERSON> Harber </PERSON> says staff morale remains high, although it is unclear what will happen to the newspaper if it is closed for three months. `` We've always figured that we would probably be shut down at some point,'' said <PERSON> Harber </PERSON>. `` It's tough working under these kind of conditions, but it's something we've had to get used to.''

 A new state law allowing students to choose their schools will improve education, proponents say. But some educators fear the plan could hurt smaller schools and bring unhealthy competition. `` We realize there may be some poor choice-making in the free market, but the challenge is to educate parents in how to make sound choices,'' says <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, assistant state education commissioner. The measure gives <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> the nation's broadest open enrollment plan, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said. Schools may refuse students only if the transfer would interfere with desegregation ratios in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, or if the school is too crowded. State funding, about $ 3,000 per youngster, follows the student to the new district. Previously, parents had to pay tuition to the new district. Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> signed the measure into law May 6. It takes effect in the 1989-90 school year in larger districts and applies statewide in 1990-91. State education officials hope schools will improve their programs in the competition to attract students. A 1986 National Governors' Association project recommended open enrollment as a way to boost school quality. `` I have mixed feelings,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, an assistant to the superintendent of the 89-student Humboldt-St. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> school district, one of the state's smallest `` If they're put on the honor system, are they going to transfer for the right reasons?'' A champion debate coach worries about students transferring for non-academic reasons. `` For some students, those activities are a very important part of what they're about,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, whose teams have won three state titles in six years and one national title. But <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> says he sees the value of such plans. `` If the concept is to allow parents and students some choice, you have to recognize that's important for them,'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said. Students could transfer to schools where their chances of making an athletic team might be better or to join friends, but it's debatable whether those are poor reasons to switch, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said `` It's just who gets to judge,'' she said. `` The people who get to make the decisions are the parents and the students. If the Education Department thinks it's a frivolous reason, it does n't matter. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who lives on the border between two districts, took advantage of a forerunner of the law and sent her two children to a different district so they could be with their friends. `` They just love going to school. If they -LRB- children -RRB- are n't happy being at a school, they are n't happy doing anything there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> said The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> opposes allowing students to transfer for non-academic reasons. `` I do n't think students should be permitted to exchange districts for athletic reasons or for some personality reasons. It seems to me that really could cause some chaos or problems,'' said Executive Director <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, whose association represents 435 districts. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 20,000 teachers, has not taken a position. `` There's a possibility that small districts could end up losing students,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, federation president. `` They may have to look at cooperative ventures with other districts or consolidation.'' <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> began open enrollment on a voluntary basis this school year, with 137 students in 95 districts choosing to participate. Under the voluntary program, districts had the option of accepting transfers from outside their districts. For the 1988-89 school year, 435 students in 153 districts applied, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zastrow </PERSON>, director of support services for the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> officials have applauded <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s efforts. `` The overwhelming majority will not make decisions like these for frivolous reasons,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlstein </PERSON>, spokesman for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and Improvement. `` Indeed, most students will not change school districts. But choice is valuable even when people decide to stay where they are.'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said he hopes the new law will prompt more schools to offer debate programs, but worries about the effect of transfers on his own program. `` If we had even four students transfer into our school and they were good, that would lock up all positions so kids from <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> would not have a shot,'' <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> said, `` If open enrollment provides a marketplace for education, then, shoot, that's going to get more schools looking at adding this program.''

<TEXT>
 On Madison Avenue, it would be called an image make-over. In the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the shifts and realignments in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign policy over the past three years have been labeled `` new thinking.'' The change in appearance of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomacy has boosted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s standing in the world and improved the atmosphere at international meetings. Stony-faced officials have been replaced by smiling, congenial diplomats, such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs secretary <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>. A more active schedule of foreign visits has distinguished <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tenure, and Soviet officials have emulated their leader's more open approach by giving news conferences and social events at home and during trips abroad. The smoother style has done much to break down the wall of mystery that has surrounded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that gave birth to the world's first socialist state. But in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rebuilding of relations with countries in regions as diverse as the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, many of the pieces of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> foreign policy have fallen into familiar places. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> coined the `` new thinking'' phrase in speeches during his first months as party general secretary, calling on his nation's policy-makers to take a fresh look at Soviet relations and activity around the world. The foreign policy mosaic evident three years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed power shows some advances, broadened influence _ and stagnation. The most dramatic achievements have been the start of Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, agreed to after eight years of fighting and five years of negotiation, and the signing last Dec. 8 of an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles, the first treaty to scrap an entire class of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other senior Soviets have claimed the INF agreement was a result of Kremlin flexibility and perseverance toward fulfilling their goal of a nuclear-free world by the year 2000, a disarmament plan set out in a speech by the leader in January 1986. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on the other hand, attributes it to the White House policy of dealing with the Soviets `` from a position of strength.'' Despite the rhetoric and conflicting claims of responsibility, the movement on arms control has encouraged observers to believe that `` new thinking'' has moved from idea to action in some instances, although the outcome remains mixed and at times contradictory. Relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have surpassed the detente era of the 1970s, when the superpowers' policy of mutual tolerance produced a short-lived warm spot in the postwar chill. Peace, friendship and educational exchange groups arrive daily to build bridges between Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. But the leaders continue to regard each other as adversaries. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and other major European powers have shared in the warmth of better ties between the superpowers and progress toward nuclear arms control. Yet the societies of East and West retain sharp differences, including their definitions of personal freedom and fundamental human rights. While Soviet soldiers are leaving the war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s support for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> remains a point of contention between the superpowers. It also suggests that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s historic practice of spreading socialist revolution remains a goal. The Kremlin's reforms have spread in part to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the Soviet bloc, to some degree, have been able to choose their own course of development. With that comes more responsibility for their own economic performance and less reliance on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for support. Soviet influence have seen the least change in the troubled <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> region, where the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict still draws a sharp line between the superpowers. And neither has succeeded in defusing the Iran-Iraq war. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has given its relations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> a lower public profile and tried to gain some influence with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in hopes of resolving the 8-year-old Gulf War. However, the Soviets still have no diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and is viewed as too closely aligned with some Arab countries to broker a peace accord in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The Kremlin has continued to make restoration of diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contingent on the Jewish state's departure from Arab territories occupied after the 1967 Mideast War. However, an exchange of visits by consular delegations was permitted last year and a sharp rise in Jewish emigration from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have to some degree improved the <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relationship.

Casual dress will do these days, when instead of calling customers from his comfortable office, he stands in line to make his pitch on a pay phone. `` It's like fighting with one arm tied behind your back,'' said <PERSON> Duntley </PERSON>, 55, as he scanned a legal pad filled with names of potential buyers around the country for <ORGANIZATION> Ameristate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 7,500 steel-cutting equipment. `` Actually, it's like throwing your money down the drain.'' `` It'' is the hassle created by the Great Phone Outage. It began May 8, when a fire damaged virtually all the vital hardware at an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> switching station. At first, the outage seemed only a minor inconvenience for customers in a handful of Du Page County communities about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But as <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> crews examined the smoldering cables and water-damaged electronics, the picture became much clearer _ and very bleak. Phones for 35,000 customers were dead indefinitely, silencing the simple crosstown call or the long-distance business deal. Limited local service has since been restored, but calls outside the immediate area are hit or miss. To offset the lack of phone service, towns increased police patrols. For several days, public employees also sat in vehicles on street corners watching for crime or fire or medical emergencies. There have been no reports of any law enforcement or fire problems linked to the outage, however. <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> crews are working around the clock to replace the wrecked equipment, but the job may take until June. `` It's total confusion. It's been a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>, an officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Hinsdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, with 16,700 residents, is one of the largest communities affected, but there is little industry here. With its cozy, colonial-style downtown shops and century-old homes, the village is a soothing retreat from the hectic pace of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But to the south in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>, industrial parks sprawl along Interstate 55. Some of the country's biggest corporate names are here, including <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which employs 1,500 people at its headquarters `` Calls to downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> have been tricky,'' said <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrsam </PERSON> `` If one finally gets through, we might pass the phone around. Despite the fire we are able to keep operating. We were never totally without anything. `` We've been using a lot of resources,'' she added, `` Faxing and Telexing all over.'' `` It's driving me crazy,'' said <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON>, a salesman for <ORGANIZATION> Outdoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Willowbrook </LOCATION>. `` At first I thought it was funny, you know, ` Hey the phones do n't work.' Now I guess it's pretty serious. `` I still run my regular route to stores that want hunting and fishing stuff, but I really ca n't tell what they might need if I do n't have a phone,'' Tweed said. `` Heck, I ca n't even call my boss in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.'' He said he spends much of his time reading magazines and talking to two secretaries. `` How are we coping? This is how we're coping,'' says <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Riendeau </PERSON>, chewing a candy bar with her legs up on the desk. `` If this keeps up, I'll be a raving lunatic. We've looked at the files and already rearranged what we rearranged last week. What else is there?'' Among the hardest hit are 24,000 florists nationwide that belong to <ORGANIZATION> FTD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the flower delivery network. About half are hooked to a computer system in Downers Grove designed to relay an order across the country in a snap. But the line to the FTD computer network flows through the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station. `` We've been absolutely crippled,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, director of operations for <ORGANIZATION> FTD </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Floral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who has the task of trying to find an alternative system. `` The flower business has not stopped _ people can still call and order. But instead of using the computer network, florists have to look up florists in other cities and call them one by one. That hurts.'' The switching station, meanwhile, has come to resemble a traveling circus. Big mess tents are erected for the dozens of laborers assigned to get the site back in order, and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> executives call the shots from a row of trailers. Customers line up at a bank of portable pay phones trucked in by the utility. `` It's been a disaster, but it's folksy,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ging </PERSON>, a local psychotherapist, referring to the small talk between people waiting to use the phones. `` There are pluses as well as minuses,'' she said. `` One plus is people have to be resourceful. Most people do n't know how strong they are, how they can get along. ... I'm impressed with how well people have been coping.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Long-Range Missile Treaty Could Be Signed By
January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a U.S.-Soviet treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons could be signed by January but that he will not set aside disputes over the `` Star Wars'' program to reach such an accord. The Soviet leader also said his policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, includes freedom of speech, but he condemned a leading dissident as a `` parasite'' and accused him of `` sponging on the democratic process.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments came in a pre-summit interview with two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news organizations. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday ran a partial transcript of the interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s English-language foreign service also carried a report about it as its lead item on Sunday. Soviet television's widely watched evening news program `` Vremya'' mentioned as its lead item that the interview had been published in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and would appear in today's Soviet newspapers The 90-minute discussion, in which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed a joint U.S.-Soviet trip to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, covered a wide range of foreign and domestic issues. The interview, conducted in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on Wednesday, produced a startling Biblical reference by the head of the officially atheistic state. When asked about how far glasnost should go and about criticism of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, the 57-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader said: `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> alone knew answers to all questions and knew how to feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We do n't possess that skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems quickly.'' The interview was conducted 11 days before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for a five-day summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> It will be their fourth meeting. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> transcript included much of the interview, it deleted a reference to <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the Kremlin's No. 2 man. It also left out a reference to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, considered more conservative than the Soviet leader, reportedly wants to slow <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, of the Soviet economy and society. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged a lively debate between the two but said `` to present these discussions _ which are a normal part of the democratic process _ as division within the leadership would be a great mistake itself.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed optimism that a superpower agreement to cut strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons will be completed by the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. `` We want to have that signed,'' he said. If the agreement `` comes to be drafted under the present <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration, I see no reason why President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I should not sign it. I would certainly welcome that,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> added. However, he cautioned that he has no plans to set aside disputes to hasten an agreement. `` If we sign with one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the same time launch an arms race in space or at sea, what would be the point? That would be senseless,'' he said. He reiterated his opposition to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Star Wars'' missile defense program, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, saying the leader who promotes an escalation of the arms race in space `` is committing a crime against the people _ his own people, and others.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials have said they do n't believe the long-range nuclear weapons treaty will be completed by the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. Another treaty to ban short - and medium-range nuclear weapons is being debated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he will ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the summit to approve a joint Soviet-U.S. unmanned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. `` Why should n't we work together? We have great experience, you have great experience _ let us cooperate to master the cosmos, to fulfill big programs,'' he said. On domestic affairs, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked whether glasnost includes freedom of speech. `` While freedom of speech is indispensable for glasnost, we see glasnost as a broader phenomenon,'' he said. Glasnost is `` the right of every citizen to openly say what he or she thinks about all social and political questions,'' he added. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was asked later whether freedom of speech applies to dissidents such as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, who was jailed for a week earlier this month. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Soviets think of <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> `` as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society sponging on the democratic process.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went on to call <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> a `` parasite.'' It was a rare reference by a Soviet leader to a dissident. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, editor of the dissident magazine Glasnost, said the computer and printer used to produce the journal were confiscated when he was arrested. In a telephone interview on Sunday, he called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s comments about him `` very unpleasant.

<TEXT>
 For years, Rep. <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> groomed his son to replace him when he retired from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But another well-known <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Republican had a different idea about who will go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After the elder <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> announced in January he would not seek re-election, it seemed only natural that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> would declare his candidacy for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 5th District. But the Lattas did n't count on a challenge from within. The challenge came from Republican <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON>, who had irritated the Lattas just enough to prompt murmurs of a feud. <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> was the highest ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislator in the state and candidate for his party's nomination for governor in 1986. Official vote totals from the May 3 congressional primary show <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> by 41 votes of more than 63,000 cast in a three-way race. But a recount is automatic because of the slim margin _ 28,680 to 28,639 _ and even the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> says the race is too close to call. `` I do n't think it divided the Republicans because I ran a positive race,'' <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON>, 49, said last week. `` I said before the primary race that I would support the eventual nominee. I expect they would do the same.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> has refused to concede, but the 32-year-old corporate attorney from Bowling Green said he will support <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> if <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> is the nominee. `` As a Republican for my entire life, you support Republicans,'' he said. Hoping to pick up the pieces is Democrat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a 51-year-old <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> attorney making his second run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> believes the departure of the elder <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> will end <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> domination in the Bowling Green district, which now boasts more registered Democrats than Republicans. `` Nobody believed I could beat <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> in 1986, and they were right. It was like running against an institution,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. `` There's no doubt that he has the contacts in the district from 30 years of service, but I'm not sure the same can be said for any of the Republicans this time.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> may be chasing moonbeams. `` I think -LRB- the GOP primary -RRB- had the potential to be a real nasty kind of thing, but basically I think the candidates did a good job of talking about themselves rather than each other,'' he said. `` I think it makes it easier to put together a campaign in the fall for the winner. ... I just do n't see people flocking to vote for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said a rift occurred between <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> in 1982, when the Legislature was redrawing congressional district lines. At the time, <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ a position he still holds. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> was trying to redraw the 9th Congressional District, a traditional Democratic stronghold that includes <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, so it would be more favorable for <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a Republican elected in 1980. To accomplish that, <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> wanted to take away one county and part of another from <LOCATION> Latta </LOCATION>'s district and place it in the 9th District, <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said. He also wanted to move <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>'s district east. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> opposed <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON>'s plan, <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> said. Eventually, <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>'s district moved a bit east and lost parts of Wood and <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> counties. The 9th District gained a part of a Democratic stronghold. The result: <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> lost in 1982, and the 9th District, under Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON> is once again Democratic territory. Later, <PERSON> Gillmor </PERSON> found himself shut out of some GOP functions in northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. For example, he discovered he was an outsider during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to Bowling Green in 1984. `` They have a dais in a hall and have 50 people up there _ <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>'s neighbors are up there _ but the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is sitting out in the crowd,'' said one Republican official, who spoke on the condition his name not be used. The elder <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, 67, son of a barber, is serving his 15th term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He is senior Republican member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a veteran member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>FmHA's New Loanmaking Policies To Allow For Debt Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New regulations to reshape the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s loan policies will cost $ 8.7 billion and push as many as 64,800 farmers into liquidation or foreclosure, the agency says. The <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to open the proposed changes to public comment this week. A summary of the agency's proposal was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a lobbyist and lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said she had not had an opportunity to study the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal in detail but indicated that the figures cited by the agency appeared to be in line with estimates `` If they had used the authority that they had gotten in the 1985 farm -LRB- law -RRB- to restructure this debt, we would n't be in a situation now where it was too late for 64,800 people,'' she said. The FmHA is often called the government's farm lender of last resort because loans are made only to those who can not qualify at banks or other commercial sources. Overall, the agency's farm loan portfolio totals around $ 26 billion to 250,000 borrowers. With loan delinquencies rising, <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> was directed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in last year's Agricultural Credit Act to rewrite many of its regulations so that borrowers would be given a greater opportunity to restructure or spread out payments and still hold onto their land. In many cases, debts far beyond the ability of farmers to repay would be `` written down'' to manageable levels or forgiven entirely. Many other regulatory changes also were ordered by the new law. Basically, the write-down would reduce a farmer's <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> debt to the level of his assets, depending upon his ability to operate with enough cash flow thereafter to repay the new loan balance. The proposed regulations are scheduled for publication this week in the Federal Register, the government's official rulemaking document, and will be open for public comment for 30 days. In its summary, the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> said about 118,000 borrowers `` were delinquent or in some other default status in early 1988.'' Those included 16,000 borrowers who have been `` accelerated'' by the agency, a process that leads to forced liquidation or foreclosure for hopeless cases. But the agency estimated that about 37,000 of the 118,000 delinquents `` will be able to resolve repayment problems through normal servicing procedures'' such as the rescheduling of loan installments and other alternatives. `` The remaining 81,000 borrowers would be eligible for consideration of restructuring with write-down of debt,'' the report said. `` Based on an earlier survey of borrowers eligible to restructuring with write-down of debt, an estimated 20 percent -LRB- 16,200 -RRB- of the 81,000 borrowers are able to show repayment on remaining debt and qualify for the write-down.'' It added: `` About two-thirds of the borrowers are unable to show repayment ability on remaining debt and would be rejected for write-down. The remaining potential write-down borrowers would not be considered for write-down because their debt was less than the estimated recovery value.'' The report included a brief profile of borrowers in the survey who qualified for <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> debt write-down: _ A large proportion of their total debt was with FmHA _ The <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> loans were `` greatly under-secured'' or there was no net value in the security for <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, which mean that a large percentage, or all, of their FmHA debt would be subject to write-down _ A substantial portion of the borrower's income was from off-farm jobs Costs of writing down FmHA debt for the estimated 16,200 qualified borrowers were estimated at a net of $ 2.1 billion. The agency said that its federal budget authority `` may be dramatically affected by the revised servicing procedures as loan losses will tend to be recognized up front'' as the write-downs are incurred instead of after the liquidation and delayed settlement of the debts. `` Requested reimbursement -LRB- of agency funding -RRB- for losses may be increased from about $ 1 billion in fiscal year 1989 to a substantial share of the total estimated write-down and loan losses of $ 8.7 billion in fiscal year 1990,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Nursing Group Watches Trial Of Nurse Accused Of Potassium Overdose</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The verdict in the trial of a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> nurse accused of killing hospital patients with a common substance used for a variety of medical procedures will influence how all nurses go about their jobs, a spokeswoman for a nurses organization says. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON>, formerly a nurse at the Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> about 20 miles east of the nation's capital, is accused of killing three of her intensive care patients by injecting them with lethal doses of potassium and attempting to murder two others the same way. Potassium is found naturally in the body, but in large amounts can cause cardiac arrest. A guilty verdict would likely have a `` chilling effect'' on health care officials who routinely prescribe and administer common medicines like sodium bicarbonate and insulin, which can be fatal if used in large quantities, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Such a verdict `` would make it more difficult for people to carry on in an already stressful environment,'' she said. `` We usually see cases where people are accused of murder by turning off machines or poisoning, not the use of an organic compound,'' she said. The 180,000-member association represents registered nurses. Autopsies on the three victims all revealed inexplicably high levels of potassium. But no official cause of death was ever listed in any of the cases and no one witnessed <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> doing anything wrong. If <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> is convicted of murder, the case could have ramifications for the nation's health care industry, according to defense attorney <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>. `` If this case went unchallenged, there would be paranoia throughout the medical industry,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. `` This case is a medical and legal nightmare.'' What makes the case so important is that potassium, an electrolyte found in the body, is also used for a variety of common medical purposes in hospitals, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> has called <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> `` a killer angel.'' He is basing his case on a study by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> that indicates more of <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON>'s patients died of cardiac arrest than did those of any other nurse at the hospital On the first day of trial in Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday, defense attorneys scoffed at the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report, and said the prosecution's case is based on the flimsiest of circumstantial evidence. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON>'s attorneys got the pathologist for the intensive care unit of the hospital where the nurse worked to say that potassium levels normally begin to rise as soon as a patient dies. Dr. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matei </PERSON> said that once the heart stops _ and oxygen ceases to flow in the bloodstream _ tissues and cells begin to break down, releasing stored-up potassium. `` It's a normal process,'' <PERSON> Matei </PERSON> told the court. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, in which a strenuous chest massage is used in efforts to restart the heart, also causes tissue breakdown, <PERSON> Matei </PERSON> testified. In addition, kidney failure contributes to high potassium rates because the bloodstream, which caries potassium, is not purified, <PERSON> Matei </PERSON> added. CPR was attempted on all three patients <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> is accused of killing, and at least one had kidney problems, hospital records indicate. `` We say it's impossible to tell whether potassium caused the heart attacks, or whether the heart attacks resulted in high levels of potassium,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said. `` This whole case is about doubt.'' The investigation of <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> runs from January 1984 to March 1985, but <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> introduced into the court record documents indicating high potassium levels for patients at the hospital during a 10-year period that encompasses the Bolding probe. <PERSON> Creech </PERSON> has relied on hospital records in an attempt to establish that <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> was present when the patients died, but hospital officials testified under cross examination that many others also had access to the alleged victims. None of <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON>'s former colleagues who have testified so far have questioned the nurse's work ethic or job performance. <PERSON> Bolding </PERSON> was indicted after a grand jury heard testimony last year on the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> study. The non-jury trial is expected to last up to eight weeks.

<HEAD>Poultry And Pork Consumption Grows With Meat Consumption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's biggest meat eaters are curbing their appetites for beef and looking for second helpings of poultry and pork. Per capita meat consumption in the major producing countries _ usually the richest _ grew about 11 percent over the last decade, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. But the gains were n't across the board. `` For instance, most of the increase came from poultry and pork, while beef declined,'' the report said. `` Consumption of lamb, mutton and goat stagnated worldwide.'' In 1975-77, Americans averaged about 127 pounds of beef and veal, 59 pounds of pork, 2 pounds of lamb, mutton and goat, and 51 pounds of poultry. By 1985-87, per capita consumption was: beef and veal, 106 pounds; pork, 63; lamb, mutton and goat, 2; and poultry, 73. Those are carcass weight equivalents before being divided and trimmed into retail cuts. Even in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the biggest meat-eater of all, per capita beef consumption dropped to 174 pounds from 187 a decade earlier. Declines also occurred for lamb, mutton and goat meat, and poultry, each down 1 pound. However, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has been striving to upgrade diets, boosted beef consumption to 62 pounds per capita from 52 pounds in 1975-77, while pork increased to 48 pounds from 43. Lamb, mutton and goat held steady at 3 pounds, but poultry consumption jumped to 23 pounds from 14 pounds previously. The report was included by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the agency's quarterly <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> issued last week. Analysts noted that per capita meat consumption is affected by many factors, including local and world economies, religion, social customs and even climate. `` Most meat is produced and consumed in high-income countries,'' the report said. `` However, new technologies, like improved refrigeration and transportation, in developing countries have opened the door for meat imports and improved the distribution of such products.'' On the other hand, religion sometimes restricts the kinds of meats that are acceptable in certain countries. Moslems and Jews shun pork, and Hindus avoid all meat. Pork is the predominant meat in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other Asian nations. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, alone, where about a third of the world's pork is produced, consumption rose to about 35 pounds from 18 pounds during the decade, the report said. Poultry consumption has gained the most, reflecting the relatively brief time span and less feed required to produce a pound of poultry meat, compared with other grain-fed livestock. `` Beef consumption predominates in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, where an abundance of forage is available for ruminant livestock production,'' the report said. `` Ruminants like cattle, sheep and goats can be raised without any grain, but this requires reliable sources of cheap forage.''

 Despite sharp differences over agricultural policy and subsidies, the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> remains the leading market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products. In calendar 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, exports of farm products to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> were worth $ 6.8 billion, up by more than 3 percent from 1986. Although sales to the European bloc _ and farm exports generally, for that matter _ have not recovered to their record levels of the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say further growth can be expected. But <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders frostily reject a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal made in negotiations under auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to phase out all trade-distorting farm subsidies by the end of the century. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s top trade official, said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last week at a meeting of trade ministers that the trade bloc would never agree to the elimination of such subsidies, although it favors unspecified reductions. According to a recent analysis by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports to the EEC this year could rise by an additional 5 percent because of `` attractive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices, favorable exchange rates and continued economic growth'' in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi has approved the demolition of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 86-year-old synagogue to make way for a complex containing a new synagogue and high-rise apartments, a local Jewish leader said. The plan to demolish the Ohel <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> synagogue split the local Jewish community and enraged preservationists, who see the project as another blow to this British colony's heritage. However, supporters argued that the Ohel <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> synagogue is dangerously old and better facilities are needed for a growing Jewish community. The chief rabbi of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commonweath </ORGANIZATION>, Lord <PERSON> Immanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobovits </PERSON>, `` waived any religious objection'' to demolishing the Ohel <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> synagogue, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON>, a synagogue leader. Synagogue trustees want to demolish the building and erect two 40-story towers and a new synagogue on the site.

<HEAD>Oregon Cuts Off Funds for Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES E. BEGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Holladay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> legislators all but voted to end her 2-year-old son's life by cutting off funds that would have paid for a bone marrow transplant. So she left southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> this spring to seek welfare funds for a transplant operation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where her son <PERSON> David </PERSON> is awaiting a transplant at that state's expense. `` I left my home. I left my dog. I left my life,'' <PERSON> Holladay </PERSON> said. `` This was extremely frustrating because we had a home there, we had school there, we had our lives set up there.'' Her supporters in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> raised about $ 5,000 of the $ 100,000 needed. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> lawmakers voted last summer to finance only cornea and kidney transplants, joining a minority of states that do n't pay for transplant operations such as those of hearts, bone marrow and livers. The move drew little notice, until 7-year-old <PERSON> Coby </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> died Dec. 2 of leukemia as his relatives were raising private contributions for a marrow transplant. The resulting furor helped persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which handles budget matters between sessions, to take up the issue. But the board voted against using emergency funds to reverse the Legislature's action. As a compromise, the panel created what's believed to be the nation's first transplant payment program to be financed by a combination of federal funds and private donations. The program is triggered when $ 85,000 in donations are turned over to the state. Some backers of restoring state financing said the compromise was better than nothing. Others were critical. `` I really think it was a spineless decision on the part of the state,'' said <PERSON> Tammi </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coby </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> is leading a petition drive to put a measure requiring the state to resume transplant financing on November's ballot. `` The fact that the state stood by and let a little boy die like that has stirred up a lot of emotions,'' she said. `` If it was up to the public, all of these people would have transplants and would be on the road to recovery by now.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coby </PERSON>'s aunt, deplored a process in which she coaxed the boy to perform for television in his final days in attempts to raise money. `` I asked him to smile for the camera when, not 30 minutes before, he had been vomiting due to his illness,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. `` I had to turn <PERSON> Coby </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> into a marketable product so the public would, in essence, buy him his life.'' Relatives and friends had raised about $ 70,000 toward the cost of the operation by the time he died. Forty-one states pay for bone marrow transplants, 36 pay for heart transplants and about 40 finance liver transplants, said <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, director of the state transplant program. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> spent about $ 500,000 toward 19 heart, pancreas, marrow and liver transplants in the two-year budget period that ended last June 30. Federal Medicaid funds pay 62 percent of the cost of transplants for qualified recipients. <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> had projected the growth in demand for transplants would push the state's cost to about $ 800,000 this year. Senate President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitzhaber </PERSON>, a physician and co-chair of the emergency board, opposes renewed state financing for transplants. He says limited health care dollars must be spent in a way that will do the most good. That standard favors funding prenatal care for many low-income women instead of financing costly and sometimes risky operations for a few people, he said. `` We can not keep people alive forever. That is a part of life,'' <PERSON> Kitzhaber </PERSON> said at one meeting. `` What we can do with our limited money is to try to reduce the number of deaths ... to save as many people as we can save.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who hopes to restore state funds, said the publicity has disgraced <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` The national image that this controversy has brought to the state is horrendous,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` How many more people actually have to die?'' he asked at the board's first meeting on restoring the funds. `` There's no logic to spend money on prenatal care and then let them die after they're born,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has provided for a state-of-the-art civilian air and sea force to hunt down drug boats and planes even as lawmakers try to draft a reluctant <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to lead the fight against narcotics smugglers. <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols use some of the nation's most sophisticated radars, patrol boats and aircraft Customs has helicopters with `` bust'' teams that swoop down on drug planes as soon as they touch down. The Customs air wing now has 87 aircraft, 37 of them with the sophisticated equipment or speed to spot a suspicious aircraft, track it on radar, pursue it, and move in for the kill with <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters. A P3 turboprop surveillance plane to be delivered to Customs next month will have high-tech radar with a full 360-degree range. Customs has four other P3s with sophisticated radar systems. Customs also operates four tethered radar balloons, called aerostats, and has four on order for the nation's <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> border from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ currently the most porous area in air coverage against drug smugglers. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> uses much of its 245-cutter fleet for drug missions, and also has new, fast patrol boats _ 16 in service and 21 on order. The agency also utilizes three fast boats that skim the water, similar to hovercraft; two E2C surveillance planes, which are the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> version of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s AWACS; and 22 long-range C130 turboprop surveillance aircraft. Nine twin-engine Falcon jets are being refitted with interceptor radar. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also operates an aerostat with another four on the way, and flies helicopters for Bahamian law enforcement teams fighting drug smugglers. To ensure sophisticated communications, coordinated radar coverage and up-to-the minute intelligence, the federal government is building three command, control, communications and intelligence centers in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> March </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Despite this formidable buildup, agency officials and lawmakers agree that it has n't stopped drugs from pouring into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is trying to even the playing field with legislation that would require more help from a military that has been wary of draining its resources and reluctant to take on a civilian law enforcement role. Both houses have passed legislation by wide margins to force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to do more, notwithstanding the 16,288 hours the military says it flew in support of drug law enforcement in 1987. Final language will be worked out in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget authorization bill. The civilian buildup, while significant, has been anything but steady. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> operating and acquisition budget for the drug war grew just from $ 509 million in fiscal 1984 to a high of $ 557 million in fiscal 1987. But the figure for fiscal 1988 is down to $ 514 million, and has forced a 55 percent cutback in hours devoted to drug patrols. `` The drug people have to know our vessels are at the dock and planes are not flying,'' said Vice Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Seizures are down.'' His agency is waiting for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a $ 60 million supplemental appropriation so that full patrols can resume. The Customs air wing has had better luck, with a budget that grew from $ 64.8 million in fiscal 1984 to $ 163 million in fiscal 1988. But Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, D-Ariz., and Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said they often fought bitterly with the military to equip the air `` We went through holy hell,'' said <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who heads the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget. English is chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that has continuously reviewed progress on the drug war. Once, his staff prepared a chart showing that the number of military drug enforcement missions rose every time he held a hearing on military cooperation _ and then dropped off until the next hearing. He once found that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> E2C's that were listed as flying anti-drug missions on certain dates never left their base. And <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said that the Pentagon only gave Customs a half-dozen Beechcraft twin-engine turboprops after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to buy a like number of new models for the military _ which used the planes in part to ferry top-ranking officers.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> has planned presidential travel to most of the 50 states and 18 foreign countries, including the economic summits in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. But President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this week was different. Preliminary preparations for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit began in 1985 after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and said they wanted to visit each other's country. `` It's a whole different mind set,'' <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON>, director of presidential advance, said of the Soviets. `` They do n't deal with the kind of things we deal with. `` We are constantly pushing and urging and prodding for things that are just sort of anathema to their system.'' For instance, there was the matter of the private dinner <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are having at a country home outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets insisted there be no press coverage. <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> reluctantly agreed, but said there should at least be an official photographer. The Soviets said no. `` I ca n't seem to get them to grasp the concept that this is an incredibly historic thing, or potentially historic, these guys eating dinner out there in this house in the country,'' <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` It would be like having a picture of <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` They just do n't think like that. You really sense that instinctively there's a pullback from anything that's going to be other than exactly like how they do it and how they've done it for years and years, and that's, of course, very closed.'' <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> believes, however, that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, does seem to be having some effect. `` There's a bit more than I expected of a willingness to let us work directly with ... some of the people at the places where we are going,'' he said. For example, he said, the advance team was able to work directly with the management of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be visiting.'' He added, `` I do n't think we were turned down from seeing anything that we requested to see. `` On the other hand, you run into this kind of block with no explanation on certain issues as to why, once you are there in these places, you ca n't do certain things. The security people can override everybody else ... and they do n't feel a need to explain the reason.'' <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> said the initial preparations for the summit consisted mainly of checking with people who had been involved in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visits before, including some members of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. More active preparations began after the two superpower leaders met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in December and announced that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sometime in the spring. Over a period of approximately two months leading up to the summit, three advance teams visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, one more than usual. For a domestic trip, as when the president goes to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, one person from the advance offices makes the initial survey, checking out proposed speech sites with an eye to establishing communications, security and the other facilities needed for a presidential visit. On a foreign trip, this group is increased to about 10 or l2 senior people who `` get a few concepts agreed to'' in consultation with their counterparts from the host country, <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> said. The final advance team, whether the president is going to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, is a larger group of maybe 45 to 50, including technical people, to make specific arrangements. In the case of the summit, <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON>, Director of Communications <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtemanche </PERSON>, first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, made an extra visit `` to negotiate the finer points of the schedule,'' the advance official said The `` ambiguous phrase'' used by people who had been to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suddenly became clear, <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> said. `` They'd say, ` It's just different from working here.'''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal for a joint mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> `` has to be studied carefully'' and may be taken up under a U.S.-Soviet space agreement. `` That's something that's been talked about, but it's a long way from being agreed upon,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> published Sunday, said he would ask President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to approve a joint, unmanned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> when they meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for their May 29-June 2 summit. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would pursue such a venture, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> noted the superpowers reached an agreement on space ventures about a year ago under which particular projects are examined. `` I presume this will come up under that heading,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Sunday, adding, `` Obviously this has to be studied carefully. We always have to be careful with problems of technology transfer.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said Sunday he had told Soviets scientists 10 days ago about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision in principle to take Soviet Mars-probe equipment along on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space launch in 1992. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, the space agency's deputy associate administrator for space sciences, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer, the unmanned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Mars Observer'' spacecraft would carry a Soviet receiver. If the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> craft still were operating when a 1994 Soviet spacecraft seeks to land on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, the Soviet receiver would improve transmissions to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said. The secretary of state also urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to approve the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles in time for the summit. `` It helps certainly to have completed something and to register that fact. ... It's good to register the fact that we can do it,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. The secretary, sidestepping any criticism of the president's conservative allies who oppose the treaty, lauded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for its thorough consideration of the pact `` I think the process has gone well. I have only compliments for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the way in which they've handled this,'' he said, adding, `` I think there's been a time for hearings, a time for questions, a time for critiques and a time for debate. There also has to come a time to decide and I think we're about there.'' The pact, formally known as the Treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, was signed by the two leaders at their December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Both the president and administration officials are eager to have the ratified treaty as a boost for negotiations with the Soviet side. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has turned aside a wave of amendments designed by its conservative opponents to kill the treaty, and debate is expected to continue through much of the week. Approval of the pact requires 67 votes, if all 100 senators are present. The secretary of state also echoed the positive remarks <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made in the interview with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters, in which the Soviet leader said he hoped he could sign an agreement slashing in half the superpower arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. `` It's certainly possible,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said of prospects for such a treaty. `` And I feel certain that at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit we will both want to agree to keep working on it hard. But whether it will actually happen or not, I do n't know. The issues are tough.'' Queried about talks on the disputed Strategic Defense Initiative, which has hampered agreement on a strategic missile pact, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has staunchly opposed any impediment to the development of a defense against ballistic missiles. `` That still leaves room for a lot of things,'' the secretary said.

 Some of the 4,700 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employees in six states who had been on strike returned to work late Sunday after negotiators reached tentative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on a new contract. Union spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said ratification votes on the three-year contract would be held this week at Firestone offices and plants in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Workers at <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> and Nobelsville plants started to return to work Sunday night. Workers in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> were expected to be back on the job Tuesday morning. The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> members struck May 15 after <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> declined to accept the cost-of-living allowance provided in an industry pattern agreement the union negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the new contract followed the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> pattern reached May 17 `` Our major goal had been to keep pattern bargaining, and that had been all we really asked from Firestone,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` This is n't really a greedy contract.'' Firestone spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said, `` We believe this is a fair and realistic contract for our employees. The agreement recognizes the particular needs of Firestone's tire operation.'' He said the company was optimistic for early ratification of the contract. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> would: _ Maintain cost-of-living allowances in each year, with a one-cent hourly increase for every increase of 0.26 in the Consumer Price Index. _ Boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from future cost-of-living adjustments in increments of 10, 10 and 5 cents. _ Increase retirement pensions for current workers by $ 3.50 to $ 23.50 per month for each year of service In addition, current retirees would receive a lump sum bonus of $ 200 before Dec. 1. _ Provide choice of first-dollar health insurance coverage or an 80-20 percent co-payment plan that includes a $ 1,000 enrollment incentive bonus. _ Make 35 percent matching contributions in the employee savings plan that is part of the 80-20 comprehensive health plan. Both plans provide for a 401-K savings plan. In addition, the pact assures continuation of the contract if a Firestone plant is sold to another company during the next three years, and contains a no-strike wage reopener clause in the third year. Negotiations resumed Saturday at 1:15 p.m. with the assistance of federal mediator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorley </PERSON> and an agreement was reached at 5 a.m. It was the only session held since the strike began May 15. The strike was the first involving Firestone since 1976, when the <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> struck all the Akron-based rubber companies except General Tire. In a related development, the union said a contract covering 15,000 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> workers was ratified Sunday when Local 2 in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, which represents 1,700 members, `` overwhelmingly approved'' the agreement. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said seven of eleven locals at <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> had voted on the contract. Six locals representing a total of 8,060 members had approved it, and one with 231 members rejected it. Ratification had been assured Friday when a <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> local in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, voted by 72 percent to 28 percent to accept the pact. It was the second <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> proposal to be put to a vote. <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> members at three other <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> locals also were scheduled to vote Sunday. They had approved the inital contract proposal. Under the <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> constitution, contracts must be approved by `` a majority of union locals representing a majority of members.''

 The black vote, which has gone almost unanimously to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> so far, is becoming more of a wild card as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tightens his grip on the Democratic nomination and both parties look ahead to the fall election. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which holds its primary June 7 along with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to finish out the Democratic primary season, is a case in point.

And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has worked hard to avoid alienating <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters, is hoping to claim a share of the black voting bloc in the primary _ a share he hopes will increase dramatically in November. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, assured of the Republican nomination, also has the fall contest in mind as he woos the state's blacks. Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backer, has shown strong support among blacks, and the vice president is hoping that will translate into some votes for him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is heavily favored to win the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, perhaps with 70 percent or more of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strength appears to be concentrated in highly urban areas. The closest contests, Democrats say, will be in about half a dozen so-called `` delegate districts,'' where voters will elect a total of 71 delegates pledged to one of the two candidates. Such skirmishes, of course, are small in comparison to the battle that looms in November. Pollster <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says he believes blacks could effectively pick the next president. A strong turnout by blacks, traditionally Democratic by an overwhelming margin, could break a Bush-Dukakis tie, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` Race will be a front-and-center issue,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> forum last week on the black vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> say their drive to register new voters for the primary might pay off for the Democrats in the state in November, helping win back support captured by <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> in 1985. Party leaders also are working hard to head off tension between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps. While competition in advance of the primary has been healthy, it has not been nasty. The candidates themselves met amiably a week ago at the party's state convention in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> State Democratic chairman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkin </PERSON> says he believes black voters will return to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> fold, despite going heavily for a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate three years ago. `` They were for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Durkin </PERSON> says. `` They were n't for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. ... I think we're getting them back.'' <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> campaign, says he believes both Democrats and Republicans have become wiser as a result of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s pioneering candidacy. `` On both sides, there's a learning taking place,'' he said. Blacks, he said, are no longer just a voting bloc, but a political force. `` We're growing of age,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>.

 Here are excerpts of the face-to-face interview conducted Wednesday between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and senior executives and editors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, and written answers to questions submitted to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in March. The excerpts are taken from the transcript which was prepared by the Post from the original English and Russian language used during the interview. The excerpts from the written questions and answers are taken from the English language text supplied by the Soviet government. Q: -LRB- <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Well, we are aware that you are following many things, in particular events in our country, and that you read a lot and remember everything -LRB- laughter -RRB-. A: Well, someone recommended me very well to you. I must extend to you Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s warmest regards. Q: Thank you. We had such a nice meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. I was hoping perhaps to be able to see her here, but if not please give her my best regards. A: She is not an easily manageable person -LRB- laughter -RRB-. Q: They say that about all of us. A: There is an interesting phrase, I think, of -LRB- <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Engels </PERSON>'. He used to say that a woman is an entire civilization. ... Q: Looking ahead to the party conference, we'd like your personal reaction to a number of specific proposals. For example, do you support the idea of fixed terms of office for party leaders, and, if so, would that include the position of general secretary itself? A: Well, you'll hear the answers in the coming days to all such questions. But I would say one word: Yes. Q: We hope you'll say a little more than one word -LRB- laughter -RRB-. A: Well, let me anticipate what you are going to read in the papers in five or six days. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> wants to find out earlier. Q: This is Newsweek. A: Your empire, then, wants to know things earlier. Q: Our empire is competitive within itself also, like all empires. Q: The interest in the party conference is so great, could you not perhaps, even in more general terms, discuss your hopes for this meeting, which is obviously such an important event. A: I certainly think that my expectations coincide with the expectations of our whole society. First of all, we want to take stock of what has happened over these three years, to sort out the history of perestroika, and, of course, we want that analysis of this period to be a critical one. We want to draw lessons _ perhaps that will be necessary. And based on that analysis, we may have to take some corrective measures in what we are doing in perestroika. But I think that the central question is the question of how to deepen this process, how to move forward with perestroika and make it irreversible. Therefore, the main questions at the conference will relate to deepening the economic reform and to deepening the democraticization of our party and society. This is the main thing. As for the rest of it, I think you will find out more. Q: Soviet editors have told us that Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> endorsed the article in <LOCATION> Sovyetskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rossiya </LOCATION> that had some praise for the Stalin era. You personally endorsed an editorial in Pravda that refuted the Sovyetskaya Rossiya article. Can you tell us if the <ORGANIZATION> Sovyetskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> article reflected Mr. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s views -LRB- this second reference to the Sovyetskaya Rossiya article and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was dropped, apparently inadvertently, when the interpreter put this question to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in Russian -RRB-, and does this exchange suggest that there is a serious difference of opinion in the leadership about how far glasnost should go and the view of the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era itself? A: Well, my impression is that this whole theme of deep divisions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership as to perestroika, as to the prospects of perestroika and the evaluation of the past, is being pushed not by Soviet editors but by the western media. That's my first reaction. I do n't know the motives behind the fact that this is systematically tossed up, and is then broadcast by various `` voices'' -LRB- foreign radio stations -RRB- in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and other languages into our country. ... The current leadership of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ including the Politburo and the government _ was formed basically after April 1985, when we set out on the course of perestroika, and all our leaders, both our political leaders and government leaders, are committed to perestroika and are actively involved in designing and implementing perestroika. ...

<HEAD>WASHN: implementing perestroika.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 When such huge undertakings as perestroika take place, when we need to develop not only the strategy but also the tactics of moving forward, that requires not only active dialogue in the leadership but in the whole society. And that is what has been happening. The whole country is now an enormous debating society. And it is natural that in the leadership itself there is lively and constant discussion within the framework of perestroika seeking answers to those questions that have been put on the agenda by us. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> alone knew answers to all questions and knew how to feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread. We do n't possess that skill, we have no ready prescription to solve all our problems quickly. We, together with our society, are seeking answers to all questions. And this is accompanied by discussions, and sometimes by heated debate, and that is normal. Our problem has been that for many years there was no such debate in the society, in the party, not in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, not in the government itself or in the Politburo. This absence of debate led to many losses, mistakes and omissions. To present these discussions _ which are a normal part of the democratic process _ as division within the leadership would be a great mistake itself. Maybe some people want there to be disagreement, even want the leadership to quarrel and to be split, but that's something quite different. That has no connection to the actual characteristics of the leadership in our country. Q: In your very interesting written answers to us, you called freedom of speech `` indispensable,'' yet some Soviet citizens still get into trouble with the authorities for what looks to us like attempts to exercise freedom of speech. <PERSON> Paruir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikyan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -LRB- editors of a new unofficial magazine called Glasnost -RRB- are recent examples. Is this because some of your authorities do n't get `` the new thinking'' or is this because that sort of, the things that those people have done is not something you consider expression of freedom of speech? A: ... The most interesting things that perestroika has demonstrated is that our people, while being firmly in favor of the renewal of society, and of change, have firmly expressed the view that changes could happen only within the boundaries of socialism, and on the basis of socialist values. Even advances in the economic sphere like cooperatives, cost accountability, leasing and individual enterprise, all of this is being discussed seriously, even scrupulously, in our society. People ask, `` Is this not a retreat from the principles of socialism?'' Some ask if we are undermining the principles of socialism. And that is because 90 percent of the people living today in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were born and have been raised under socialism. And the present leadership only wants to try to develop this socialist system which opened the way for us in all spheres of life. We know socialism, we know its achievements and its problems. And we are going to work within the boundaries of the socialism we have chosen. That is why everything that evokes in people anxiety that someone has tossed up other values, including in the ideological sphere, this evokes a critical reaction. That is also the democratic process. Democracy is like that. People here know that the <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> `` organization,'' is tied not only organizationally but also financially to the West, that his constant visitors and guests are Western correspondents. Therefore people think of him as some kind of alien phenomenon in our society sponging on the democratic process, sponging on the positive aspects of perestroika. This happens _ it happens in nature, too. There are such parasites living off healthy organisms and attempting to harm them. ... I have said that perestroika is a kind of melting pot that will make our society stronger, that will reveal its democratic, human potential, all in the interest of man. And that which some suggest _ that we look for our future in different values and liquidate socialist property, etc. _ our people reject. This will not be accepted _ it is an illusion. And you must know this.

 Q: In your written answers you say that you would welcome another meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive weapons. Is this agreement on a 50 percent reduction so important and so close to completion now that it could be signed while negotiations on space defenses and on other problems such as sea-launched cruise missiles continue? A: Well, we are very much and fundamentally committed to decisive reductions in nuclear arms, and therefore we want to see the agreement on 50 percent reductions in strategic offensive forces. We want to have that signed. In our assessment we have covered together a long road in the search for conclusions to all questions. But I think you would agree with me that if I say that if we sign with one hand a treaty reducing strategic offensive forces in one area and at the same time launch an arms race in space or at sea, what would be the point? That would be senseless. ... If we just replace one kind of arms race with another, particularly in space, where the arms race would take a particularly dramatic turn, we would undermine the trust that has begun to be built, we would make worthless all the experience that we have accumulated at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations. This new kind of arms race, new sphere for an arms race, new criteria _ it would take decades to reach some kind of agreement and come to an agreement. I think that he who pushes for an arms race in space is committing a crime against the people _ his own people, and others. That must be said with all responsibility, and with clarity. Such an approach, such an idea, is a road to destabilization, to unpredictability on matters of security. This must be condemned, the initiator of such an approach must be pilloried. And sea-launched cruise missiles _ this would also be a roundabout maneuver that could become a new avenue for the arms race. And therefore, we are linking all those questions together and we believe that this is a fair approach. What is more, I have to say that we see genuine possibilities to resolve all those questions, to resolve all of them together and to have a treaty on a 50 percent reduction of strategic offensive arms and then to continue farther.

 Q: The reason behind my question is that there has been movement on both sides toward agreement. I thought perhaps that there's been enough movement on the question of SDI -LRB- Strategic Defense Initiative -RRB- and that now the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declaration -LRB- at the December summit -RRB- could perhaps serve to come to the final great problem ... on SDI; which is the difference over what happens at the end of the adherence period. Does the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declaration solve the conflict over what happens at the end of the adherence period? A: I believe that which is contained in the statement on the understanding of the ABM -LRB- Anti-Ballistic Missile -RRB- treaty in the form that was accepted in 1972 and as we understood it until 1983 _ that does provide a basis to move forward toward 50 percent reductions in strategic offensive arms. But only in that way, in no other. I have n't answered the other part of your question. We will work with any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> administration on this important aspect of Soviet-American relations. I have in mind the process of negotations in the context of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks to find a way to agree on a new treaty to reduce nuclear arms. If that happens during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, we would welcome that. If that happens after the election, with the new president, then so be it. We are ready to work. We do n't want to waste any time. We are prepared to continue. It is up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> side now. -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose from his desk at this point and moved to a shelf to retrieve a model of a Soviet rocket. -RRB- We are going to invite the president _ and I would like to say in conclusion _ to cooperate on a flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Here is a model of that rocket. These are pictures of the launching of that rocket -LRB- pointing to color photographs on the wall of his office -RRB- sent to me from the cosmodrome in Baikonur, which I visited last year. The rocket last year lifted 100 tons into orbit. After certain modernizations it will be able to carry 200 tons. Now we are lifting 20 tons. Why should n't we try to work together? We have great experience, you have great experience _ let us cooperate to master the cosmos, to fulfill big programs. And whatever is being done in outer space and whatever is being done in SDI to achieve new technological breakthroughs. As a result of a joint project to study <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s comet, we have been able to develop dozens of new materials, we have been able to make major advances in electronics and in mathematics This resulted really in major scientific breakthroughs. This is a field for cooperation that would be worthy of the Soviet and American peoples. And I will make that proposal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>WASHN: President Reagan.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts of the written questions and answers. In their written response, the Soviets revised some of the questions. Where the questions differ significantly, parts of the original questions submitted by the Post appear in parenthesis. Q: Have the three meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> changed your ideas as to how peaceful cooperation -LRB- competition -RRB- between capitalist and socialist countries should be regulated in the future? How do you think the forthcoming summit will contribute to stabilizing that competition? ... A: I am convinced that positive trends are unfolding in the world. There is a turn from confrontation to coexistence. The winds of the Cold War are being replaced by the winds of hope. And I see that a significant role in that process is being played by the signs of improvement in the relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. All over the world there is an acute need for change or, if you wish, a need for restructuring international relations. In that situation it is essential to continue positive contacts between the East and the West. ... As for the potential results of the upcoming fourth meeting with the president and, notably, the prospects for a detailed agreement on a 50 percent cut in strategic offensive weapons, the past few months and weeks have seen so much speculation that I would like to make the following point: Be patient, the meeting is just a few days away, let the president and I work together. Whatever we arrive at will certainly not be concealed from the public. ... If an agreement on a 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive weapons comes to be drafted under the present <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration, I see no reason why President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I should not sign it. I would certainly welcome that. Q: Many people in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> think that nuclear weapons have been instrumental in maintaining stability in the world over the past few decades. Would it not be more rational for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in those conditions to agree on preserving minimal nuclear deterrents? ... A: I can not agree with those who think that the drive for a nuclear-free world is hopeless. I have argued more than once with representatives of the West over their case that without nuclear weapons we would never have survived for 40 years without another world war. This is just a conjecture. But what about a sober evaluation of the real role played by the so-called `` balance of fear?'' It has given us nothing but unheard-of militarization of foreign policies, economies and even intellectual life. It has caused damage in the sphere of international morality and ethics and has killed the atmosphere of mutual trust, friendliness and sincere interest in each other which was born in Soviet-American relations in the years of joint warfare and victory over fascism. I am convinced that strategic military parity can be maintained at a low level and without nuclear weapons. We have clearly formulated our choice: to stop, then reverse the arms race. As for the so-called `` minimal nuclear deterrence,'' I will not argue now with the proponents of that idea. So far, you and we have more than 10,000 warheads each in our strategic arsenals. Let us first cut them by 50 percent. Maybe then by another 50 percent and then once again. In the meantime, let us come to terms on the elimination of chemical weapons and start reducing conventional armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That process should be open not only for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> but for all other nuclear and nonnuclear states. That will be an important incentive for the demilitarization of politics, ways of thinking and international relations in general. ... Q: The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have announced that even with a balance in the conventional forces -LRB- if a parity of conventional forces were achieved -RRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, nuclear weapons will still need to be preserved on the continent as a means of retaliation -LRB- would still be needed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to pose an unacceptable risk for an aggressor -RRB-. If, in keeping with that position, nuclear disarmament is unacceptable for the West, should we not try to reach a joint agreement on the terms of modernization of the tactical nuclear weapons deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>? ... A: The talk about nuclear weapons on the continent as a means of retaliation is the same old concept of a `` limited'' nuclear war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It absolutely contradicts what I conferred with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president about back in Geneva-notably, that nuclear war can not be won and simply must not be allowed to happen. ... We support the ideas of nuclear-free zones in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. We are also in favor of a 300-kilometer corridor free of all nuclear and any other heavy weapons in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I am naming just some ideas but certainly not all. ...

<TEXT>
 Q: <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> suggested cutting tens of thousands of nonnuclear weapons that could be used for surprise or large-scale offensive operations. Does this approach fall within the boundaries of your stated willingness to negotiate on the basis of asymmetrical reductions? A: On our side, there are no obstacles to that. As for the existing asymmetries in the arsenals of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty, I have already expressed my views on that score many times: Asymmetries exist on both sides. We stand for the elimination of asymmetry on the basis of reciprocity. For example, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty armies have more tanks. And the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> armies have more attack planes. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and our allies are ready to eliminate these and other asymmetries without delay but, let me repeat, on the basis of reciprocity. And then it would be possible to balance armaments on the lowest possible level sufficient only for defense. ... We are not satisfied with the pace of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> consultations of the 23 countries elaborating the objective and format of the future conference. If the work in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> proceeds in the same on-again, off-again manner, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will have to wait for a long time for those asymmetries to be eliminated. ... Q: In the months remaining of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, what is required to broaden your personal relationship with the president into an institutional relationship and carry both into the future? A: The experience of present-day international relations shows the paramount importance of meetings between leaders of states, all the more so when the case in point is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Since both countries are well aware of the need for intensifying the dialogue and improving relations, it is absolutely obvious that it is not only the leaders' personal views that matter. This is the imperative of our time. This is the striving of our peoples. Such is the constant in the Soviet-American dialogue. ... we are interested in developing the dialogue, we will strive to make it more productive, we will try to facilitate the `` adaptation'' of the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to contacts with us, and will do everything within our power to keep the process begun in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985 from stopping. And, naturally enough, we hope for the same attitude on the American side. Q: Do you feel President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a different kind of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leader? ... A: ... I'm not particularly fond of giving personal character references. But since you ask, I would like to say that realism is an important quality in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a politician. By this I mean the ability to adapt one's views to the changing situation, while remaining faithful to one's convictions. ... Q: The Americans are familiar with the rapid erosion that occurred in the situation in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> once they decided to withdraw from that war. -LRB- How does the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> propose to avoid such an erosion now that the outline of the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been drawn? If attacks on Soviet units increase during the withdrawal, what military response will the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> make? -RRB- What changes, in your view, will take place in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the next year while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is pulling out its troops? What will the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s contribution to bringing about those changes be? ... A: Any parallel between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is artificial. Not to mention how different the nature of the conflicts is. I would only like to remind you of the fact that prior to the Americans pulling out of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, that country was divided for 20 years into two nearly equal parts by a border along the 17th Parallel. In both sections, there existed governments personifying regimes opposite in nature and incompatible in aim. There is nothing of that kind in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. On the contrary, the government there has set itself the goal of achieving the Afghan people's national reconciliation and, on this basis, its own reorganization into a coalition government with the participation of all parties to the conflict. It goes without saying that the future depends in many respects on how honestly and consistently all the signatories to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements will meet the commitments assumed, without their trying to get around them in some way or another or deceive their partners. I can reaffirm once again that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intends to meet its obligations precisely and undeviatingly. ... Q: You said that when the Afghan knot is untied, it will have the most profound impact on other regional conflicts, too. Is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> prepared to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries in resolving other conflicts, for example in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>? A: Yes, it is prepared. I have already said that, given constructive cooperation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and major emphasis on the prestige and capabilities of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, its <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and other bodies, political settlement of regional conflicts and prevention of new ones will gradually become an international practice, a norm. I would like to confirm this conviction of mine. ...

 <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON> cooks his dinner every night, takes a drive once a day and is eager to show off the trailer he has occupied across from <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> for more than 40 years. <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON>, 94, is cheerful about his life and surroundings here in a wooded area writer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> made famous. But there is a pall that hangs over the rustic trailer park. <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> <PERSON> Breezes </PERSON> is dying. When the state acquired the land 10 years ago, the owner insisted that the residents of the park called <ORGANIZATION> Walden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breezes </ORGANIZATION> have life tenancy. But the state ruled that vacant trailers must be removed. State officials plan to make the trailer park part of <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> after the last resident has died or moved away. As a result, long cement slabs are all that remain of many trailer homes in the park. <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON>'s home is one of only 20 in <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breezes </LOCATION>, which onced housed 70 trailers. But residents say they are used to the dwindling number of neighbors, in part because they all cherish their independence. But <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON>'s closest friend, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaffield </PERSON>, who lives across the park and `` will talk you blind if you let him,'' is sometimes nostalgic for the old days when <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> <PERSON> Breezes </PERSON> was bustling and family-filled. `` ` People are moving away or dying,'' said <PERSON> Swaffield </PERSON>, who also lives alone in his trailer. `` Every now and then you get a call that someone's passed on.'' <PERSON> Caswell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swaffield </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breezes </LOCATION> after their wives died, and spend most of their time alone. As recently as last year they fished together at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> almost daily. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Walden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breezes </ORGANIZATION>' remaining residents have outlived their neighbors and their spouses. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 80, a widower for three years, still wears his wedding band. He is philosophical about the sense of finality of <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breezes </LOCATION>. `` It's kind of like, here today, gone tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, pausing between a strenuous raking of leaves around his trailer. `` When someone dies, they just go ahead and sell all the articles inside and get rid of the ... thing.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he still feels `` young at heart'' and has resisted attempts by his children to move in with them. `` This is a place where elderly people can live independently,'' he said. `` Most people should realize that we do n't have to be put away.'' Independence at <LOCATION> Walden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Breezes </LOCATION> is so strong that remarriage among the widows and widowers is uncommon. `` No, I ca n't see why I would,'' said <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskett </PERSON>, 75, a 29-year resident whose husband died five years ago. `` We all know each other but it's more like friends. No romance.'' <PERSON> Haskett </PERSON> and one of her best friends, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, 77, often miss the old days at the park. But fishing is not what they remember most fondly. `` We used to have great parties by the lake or picnics by someone's mobile home,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Haskett </PERSON>, who lives in a fancy one-bedroom trailer with a mirrored living room. `` Now we're all being phased out.''

 Q: Recalling her talks with you, Mrs. -LRB- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> drew a comparison between the criticism and resistance a western leader faces in bringing change and what you have encountered in pushing perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- and glasnost -LRB- openness -RRB-. ... by glasnost you seem to mean something different from what we think of as freedom of speech. Could you elaborate on the differences? A: ... What is taking place in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is an all-embracing process of revolutionary renovation of socialist society on the basis of the historic choice which we do not doubt and which proved in principle the only correct one for our people 70 years ago. ... Of course, combating stagnation in the course of perestroika and dismantling the mechanism of retardation require that sluggishness and conservatism be overcome. Sometimes we are confronted with hectic impatience. There is also conscious resistance on the part of those whose narrow selfish interests are incompatible with perestroika, socially, economically or morally. However, this is precisely what we mean by perestroika, in the course of which we want to renovate our society, upgrade it quality-wise. Perestroika is proceeding in width and depth, encompassing all public groups and all our territory. Perestroika is growing and gaining momentum. As for glasnost, it and freedom of speech are, of course, interconnected. However, these are not identical things. I would put it this way: While freedom of speech is indispensable for glasnost, we see glasnost as a broader phenomenon. For us it is not just the right of every citizen to openly say what he or she thinks about all social and political questions, but also the duty of the ruling party and all bodies of authority and administration to ensure openness in decision-making, be accountable for their actions, act on criticism and consider advice and recommendations from the shop floor, public organizations and individuals. ... Q: ... your dramatic decision to free <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and ... to ease the conditions of emigration for some Soviet Jews who desire to live abroad have attracted attention around the world. ... What further steps do you plan in this direction? A: Our perestroika, the main factor of which is creative effort, also includes doing away with all deformations of the past years, with everything that hampers manifestation of the humanitarian essence of socialism. We know our problems and speak honestly and openly about them. The process of democratization does not bypass the sphere of human rights and liberties. We are enhancing the political and public status of the human personality. Many issues have already been resolved within the framework of the democratic process, while others will be resolved as Soviet society changes qualitatively in the course of perestroika. ... Once I said, and it seems to me, to an American: Please, show me a country that has no problems. Each country has problems of its own, human rights included. Of course, we are well-informed about the situation with political, social, economic and other rights in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We know well the achievements and problems, but also the flaws of American society. But we do not tolerate interference in your home affairs, though we deem it right to express our views on the processes taking place in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, on your administration's policy. But we do not want to make all this a reason for confrontation. We consider such an approach to be correct, fair, we see it as meeting the interests of Soviet-American relations and their future. I want to emphasize once again that we do not try to impose anything on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but at the same time we rebuff attempts by any side to meddle in our affairs, no matter who tries to do so in your country. ... We also welcome the accord on setting up a permanent body on human rights with the participation of deputies to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> Supreme Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen. It is the duty of legislators in both countries to show concern for observance of the citizens' rights ... For the sake of our mutual understanding, please, do not try to teach us to live according to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> rules _ it is altogether useless. And I repeat that, for our part, we do not intend to suggest our values to the Americans. Let each side live in its own way, respecting each other's choice and voluntarily exchanging the fruits of our labor in all spheres of human activity. I am sure that each nation, each people does not lose but, conversely, wins if it looks at itself critically and does not ignore others' experience, if it is open to understanding of and respect for a different culture, a different way of thinking, different customs, lastly, a different political system, of course, if it is not terrorist, fascist or dictatorial.

<HEAD>Former Philippine Rebel Barred From Travel To U.S. Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The former head of the Philippine communist rebel army says he was denied entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a weekend seminar, despite an invitation from a congressman and assurances from <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government officials that he is not a threat. `` Some absurd perceptions of some influential quarters in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration about Philippine problems prevented me'' from attending, said the former rebel, <PERSON> Bernabe </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON>. He spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to the Philippine-American group that had scheduled him as its featured speaker at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> seminar on the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which ended Sunday night. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON>, said Sunday that <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> was turned down for an immediate visa because of `` the unusual nature of his case,'' but he said the application was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for a possible waiver. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no official spokesman available on weekends. <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON>, who is still widely known among Filipinos by his rebel name, `` Commander <PERSON> Dante </PERSON>,'' was jailed by ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> but set free when President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> came to power in February 1986. In the late 1960s, he founded and led the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> which officials estimate now has up to 25,000 rebels fighting the Aquino government. <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> has not renounced communism, but a <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he carries a valid Philippine passport and is no longer considered a rebel or a terrorist. <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> was an unsuccessful candidate for the Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year. The Philippine official, who asked not to be identified, said top embassy representatives informally told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials they saw no reason why <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> could not travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Huchel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> was aware that <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> also had an invitation to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., and that he had been scheduled to speak Saturday at the national conference of the Campaign for Democracy and Independence The organization, known as CAMDI, includes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups that opposed ex-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and originally supported President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> but have become increasingly critical of her 2-year-old government. <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON>, in a statement translated for the group from <LOCATION> Tagalog </LOCATION>, said he applied for a visa April 27 and was interviewed on May 2 for three hours by <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> embassy vice-consul <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON>. He said Ms. <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> asked him if he might have reason to seek asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, since he survived an assassination attempt last June. `` Rest assured, ma'am,'' <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> said he replied. `` I am still rooted in Philippine soil and would not stay a day longer than necessary.'' He added: `` She was not convinced. She thought perhaps that I would mistake the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> skyscrapers for the sugar cane fields of my central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> hometown enough for me to launch a guerrilla warfare in the metropolitan jungle of the biggest city in the world to encircle <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> confirmed that Ms. <PERSON> Matteson </PERSON> interviewed <PERSON> Buscayno </PERSON> but said he could not discuss details of the visa interview. Another speaker at the CAMDI seminar, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> regent <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemenzo </PERSON>, said he also had trouble entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Nemenzo </PERSON>, who was also jailed for a time under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and has been critical of <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, said his visa was held up until the final day of another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seminar he was to attend last month. <PERSON> Nemenzo </PERSON> was affiliated with a now nearly defunct Soviet-allied Philippine communist party until the early 1970s, when he resigned. He said his past connections gave him trouble even though his last visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Israel Using Computers To Suppress Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is using computers as a weapon in the struggle to suppress the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands. A computer linkup of the military administration, the police and the civil and security service offices allows <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to monitor almost every aspect of life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab merchants who obey the calls of the uprising's underground leaders and refuse to pay taxes are often nabbed in a network of computerized roadblocks. On the road between <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, an AP reporter saw checkpoints where portable computers were used to track down tax evaders. Names are taken from identity cards Arabs are required to carry. When the names are entered in the computer, it identifies those who owe taxes. The military government demands tax payment in exchange for a registration of a newborn child or marriage, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are scared. The tax officials catch you and seize your car or impose a huge fine,'' said <PERSON> Fahim </PERSON>, a wholesaler in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> who gave only his first name. A military government official said about 400 vehicles belonging to delinquent Arab taxpayers have been seized in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The computer `` is indeed the ultimate instrument of population control, a carrot-and-stick operation,'' researcher <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON> wrote in his annual study of the occupied territories. <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> started to develop a computerized occupied lands data bank in August 1985. The five-year, $ 8.5-million project was undertaken by <PERSON> TIM </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representative of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer company Data General. The aim was to computerize all information pertaining to the population: `` property, real estate, family ties, political attitudes, involvement in illegal activities, licensing, occupations,'' he wrote in the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a study financed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and Rockefeller Foundations. Some of the military government's departments, such as those of interior and transport, are almost totally computerized today, providing immediate access to personal and vehicle usage data, a senior Israeli official said. Military authorities also can gain access to the main police computer, linked to all the relevant ministries and principal police stations, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlezinger </PERSON>. She said by using special passwords, a police official can call up such ` subcategories'' as personal data, criminal records or traffic violations. The data base was used on a wide scale this month in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where the army started to exchange 400,000 Palestinians' identity cards for new ones At a military office set up at a school in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rimal </LOCATION> neighborhood, an AP reporter saw a computer center with 23 portable <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers. Military sources said the computer marked with a star the names of those wanted for security offenses and a special code appeared next to the names of those who owed taxes. Some cards also were stamped with a warning: `` The bearer of this card is not allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' That identifies the residents as `` troublemakers'' in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s view and confines them to the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The Palestinians have fought back. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> this week burned a telephone junction box believed to serve army computers. But military officials said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not giving up on computers. The army, in fact, is moving ahead with plans to computerize the prison system, which has been swamped by the flood of 6,000 people detained in the uprising.

The more than 900 Republicans who remained elected <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> to preside and continued the convention on their own, adopting a party platform and electing 18 at-large delegates to the National Republican Convention. <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said he would convene a meeting of the party's state executive committee to select the official at-large delegates, leaving open the possibility of two <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> delegations. Thirty other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates were already picked at district conventions. <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> had presided Friday over an abbreviated session marked by chanting and booing by many of the 968 delegates _ mostly <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters and newcomers to party politics _ who had been disqualified by the party regulars' credentials committee. The credentials committee, complying with a court order, considered and granted appeals by many of the disqualified delegates Friday evening and, on Saturday, party officials began the lengthy process of registering the official delegates. But <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> adjourned the convention, saying it had been taken over by what he described as an unruly mob. He told reporters the court rulings would be appealed to the state's highest court and, if necessary, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 A retired policeman who assassinated a federal judge and then committed suicide was seeking revenge because the jurist last week dismissed a $ 2.5 million lawsuit filed by the man's daughter, authorities say. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, 67, left a suicide note at his Bath, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, mobile home saying he was acting alone after he was notified of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>'s decision in the sexual harassment case, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> family was totally consumed with this case and it had become a crusade in their lives,'' <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s wife said her husband killed the judge `` out of love'' for his daughter, <PERSON> Carolee </PERSON>. On Saturday, <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> was gardening when <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> burst through a hedge and opened fire with a .38 - caliber revolver, striking the judge several times, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> It was only the second time this century a federal judge was assassinated. On May 29, 1979, Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was shot by a sniper outside his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, home. <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> staggered toward the kitchen door 8 to 10 feet away. `` I need help! I need help!'' he shouted, according to a neighbor who heard but did not see the attack, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The 56-year-old judge ran into his study, closed the door and barricaded himself as the gunman followed, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> collapsed and died in the study. `` When he was satisfied the judge was dead, he turned the gun on himself,'' said <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> was found in the foyer a few feet away with the revolver in his hand. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s 38-year-old daughter filed the lawsuit in 1981 against <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and her boss, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. She rejected a large settlement offered by the bank before the trial began March 23, the Times reported. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1969 after 20 years and was a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at the bank where his daughter worked, spent much of his life savings on the case, <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> was present many of the days that this matter was being heard before the judge and there was at least one confrontation that occurred in the courtroom during the course of the trial,'' <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. In an interview Sunday night with The -LRB- <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- Morning Call, <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, portrayed him as a kind, well-liked family man who was driven to violence by the lawsuit. `` It was eating away at him that <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> did what they did to her,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Carolee </PERSON> was trying to get her life going. He did it out of love for her.'' <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s daughter said she had been fired in 1980 from her $ 28,000 a year job as vice president in the personnel department after earning five promotions. `` It was like night and day after I ended the relationship,'' she said, according to today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The judge rejected her argument that she was denied a transfer out of the personnel department because a relationship she had had with <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was over. `` Plaintiff's allegation that defendant <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, in retaliation for the termination of their sexual relationship, caused her to be denied a transfer to the real-estate finance department is not substantiated by the evidence,'' <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> wrote, according to the Times. In dismissing all of Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s claims against the bank and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, the judge also ruled that she was `` responsible for her own termination'' of employment at the Chase bank because she `` overstated her experience and potential, refused to accept management's contrary assessment and declined the only position at the time for which she was qualified,'' the Times said. Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> said her father believed the judge was biased against her, according to today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I still love my father,'' she said. `` I'm sorry about what happened, but I believe he thought he was doing something out of love, too.''

 The selection of Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is a victory for reform and a clear shift from the staunch ideology of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, whose 32-year grip on power had become an obstacle to progress, party officials said. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as general secretary on Sunday night in a sweeping reshuffle of party leadership that favored the reformists, who now will get their chance to solve <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s deepening economic crisis. A Politburo member said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> had had asked not to be nominated for the party leadership. `` There was no real reform possible as long as -LRB- <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> -RRB- was in power,'' said a prominent party member who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who turns 76 Thursday, was named to the newly created honorary post of party president at the end of a three-day party conference in which delegates assailed the veteran leader in a manner unprecedented in the Soviet bloc. `` This conference marks a radical change,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told Hungarian television minutes after being named new general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, 57, is viewed as a leader in the mold of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has gained a reputation as a pragmatist willing to face unpleasant truths about <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic stagnation. `` Mr. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s greatest merit is that he has not been afraid to make decisions that are highly unpopular,'' said <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjan </PERSON>, president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think he will personify responsibility and push for the removal of those who are incompetent and who have thwarted reforms,'' <PERSON> Demjan </PERSON> said. Reformers were clearly on the offensive throughout the conference. In debates that were often lively and critical, delegates relentlessly assailed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and called openly for new faces and new policies. Leading reformists in the party have argued openly for months that economic recovery would fail without political change. Inflation in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> reached 18.5 percent in the first quarter of this year, and its gross foreign debt is $ 18 billion, the highest per-capita foreign debt in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Several of the most vocal advocates for change advanced to key policy - making roles <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> becomes party leader of a revamped Politburo trimmed of aging bureaucrats and stacked with reformers. In the sweeping overhaul, the Politburo shrank to 11 members from the previous 13. Eight old members of the Politburo were dropped in the reshuffle. A new 108-member Central Committee replaced the former 106-member body, with about one-third of old members failing to gain re-election to the new body. In a stunning comeback, <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, who fathered <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s pioneering economic policies in the 1960s was re-elected to the Politburo He was ousted from the ruling body in 1973. Another leading reform advocate, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, also advanced to the ruling body. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, leader of the communist-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, has been a vocal supporter of efforts to allow Hungarians more of a voice in shaping economic and political affairs <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was dropped from the new Politburo. But the standing ovation he received when word of his appointment as president was announced signaled he still enjoys affection and respect among many party members. `` This is an exceptional day for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' said a prominent party official who supports reform. `` <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was a great leader but was clearly no longer competent to hold power.'' Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> asked not to be nominated for the party leadership, citing his age and what <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> termed `` the need for renewal.'' <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> nominated <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as party president but that the veteran's leader exact duties are not yet clear. The move was made `` to give respect and appreciation to a man who, for more than 30 years, has been linked to all of our results and achievements,'' <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> is the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc leader to relinquish power after such an open debate of the merits of his leadership. His replacement leaves <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, in power since 1954, as the only Soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in office. Since becoming premier in June, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has earned a reputation as a pragmatist and apparently toned down earlier hard-line views, offering any Hungarian not opposed to communism and alliance with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a part in political debate. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> took over the party leadership in 1956 after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> brought in troops and tanks to quash an anti-Soviet revolt. He gradually won popularity at home and abroad for encouraging reforms that brought Hungarian consumers one of the highest standards of living in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. But <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> came under increasing attack in the last two years when he was seen as an obstacle to needed political and economic change.

<TEXT>
 More than 600 Sikhs filed solemnly into the Golden Temple today as it was opened to the public for the first time in two weeks. The temple, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, was closed during a police siege May 9-18 that drove Sikh extremists from their temple hiding place. The separatists, who have been waging a guerrilla war for an independent homeland since 1982, had turned the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> into an armed camp. At least 46 people, mostly Sikh militants, were killed during the siege. Three militants committed suicide by taking cyanide capsules rather than surrender to police. No police or paramilitary forces were killed. Services in the inner sanctum of the temple, suspended on the second day of the siege, were resumed by priests on Sunday after volunteers washed the floor of the temple with milk to cleanse it. Police searched all 627 devotees today for weapons at an <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> police station, then moved them in four city buses to the temple for worship. Police and paramilitary troops retain a cordon around the shrine and enforce a curfew within 300 yards of its walls. The cordon is likely to stay in place until the government reaches an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has so far refused its request to enforce a ban on militants re-entering the shrine. One death was reported in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Sunday night. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said a goldsmith was shot to death by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> gunmen in the village of <LOCATION> Murh </LOCATION> near the state capital at <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. Earlier Sunday, nine deaths were reported, including four Hindus killed in a bomb blast at a railway station in the town of <LOCATION> Ludhiana </LOCATION>, 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Indian newspapers today said the bombing appeared to be the fourth attack aimed at Hindu migrant workers, who are in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> to help with the planting. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s most productive agricultural state. The latest slayings raised to more than 1,150 the number of people killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the start of the year. In all of 1987, 1,030 people were killed. Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist cause. Sikhs claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 Saying `` what's passed has passed,'' defrocked evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ended his three-month exile from the pulpit but conceded that not everyone will forgive him for his sins with a prostitute. `` I am sure there will be many ... that will see to it that I do n't forget. I realize it will be the hardest task,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said Sunday. In his first sermon since tearfully confessing on Feb. 21 to unspecified sins, the television evangelist reclaimed his pulpit with fire-and-brimstone fervor before 5,000 followers. `` Once you look up into his -LRB- God's -RRB- face, you will never be any cleaner than you are right now,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` I want to serve notice on the whole world: What's passed has passed. `` Even looking back is not fit. I am reaching forward for those things that are before. I am serving notice on demons and devils and hell _ the best is yet to come!'' he shouted. His initial appearance at the pulpit drew a polite response, but as he preached, the congregation became more enthusiastic and gave him several loud, standing ovations. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, stripped of his credentials as an Assemblies of God minister, returned after a three-month suspension originally ordered by an Assemblies' state council. National leaders of the Pentecostal denomination defrocked him in April after he refused to accept a sterner banishment of at least one year from the pulpit for a reported encounter with a prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, who says <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> paid her to pose nude for him at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> motel. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, a defrocked minister who claims in a lawsuit that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> ruined his ministry by spreading false stories about adulterous affairs, reportedly hired private detectives to photograph <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> outside the motel. After a Sunday service at his <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> needs to fast and pray. `` I would hope he is already doing that, but if he has n't, there will be no way he can make it through the battles not only he has faced, but he will be facing in the future,'' <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> said. A group of former <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> followers, meanwhile, gathered in a <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> hotel ballroom for the service of <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, an Assemblies of God church formed by ministers who recently left <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry. Worshiper <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Paradela </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s departure from the denomination led him to change churches. ` If <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> would have really repented, he would have really been obedient to the Assemblies of God,'' he said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told congregants at his Family Worship Center that he still carried the word of God. `` God called me as a child. I love him more than life itself. He is my life ... You might want to say that call is abrogated. But I know better.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not talk about the specifics of his sin, referring to the revelation and the problems that beset the ministry afterward as `` this thing.'' `` This ministry is in God's hands,'' he said. `` If he sees fit for me to sweep floors ... at a little mission across the tracks, I would be honored to do so for the rest of my life.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said that only God could heal a sinner and overcome the guilt that follows sin. `` Guilt is one of Satan's greatest weapons ... Psychiatry does n't have an answer for it, psychology does n't have an answer for it. Therapy does not have an answer for it,'' he said. `` The blood of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is not a treatment. It is a cure,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> shouted as he pounded on a large speaker on the podium. Before ushers passed the offering plate, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> referred to reports that his worldwide ministry is in financial trouble. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> recently appealed for $ 6 million, and three major cable television networks have canceled his programs. `` For every dollar we get, we spend a dollar and a dime and we spend it before we get it because the world needs to hear the gospel of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' he said.

 The departure of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader came during unprecedented open criticism of his policies and offered proof of the Soviet bloc's new penchant for orderly transfers of power <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who ran the party for 32 years, stepped down as general secretary on Sunday at the end of a three-day conference at which delegates openly called for new faces and new policies. He turns 76 on Thursday. They got their new party leader in Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, a 57-year-old pragmatist who appears open to political reform. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was named to the largely ceremonial post of party president, a position created for him. According to Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> asked conference delegates who made sweeping changes in the party elite not to nominate him as party leader, citing age and `` the need for renewal.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, in turn, nominated <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> for his new ceremonial post. The procedure suggested the change in power may have been agreed upon in advance in an attempt to unite party ranks increasingly split in recent months over the pace and shape of reform. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in December, outgoing party boss <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> also reportedly nominated his successor, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> has kept <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> in the Politburo and in the ceremonial state presidency. Both transfers occurred without the outward tumult that surrounded <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>'s promotion in 1969 to replace <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> after the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968, or <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rise to power after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian revolt of 1956. It is not clear how much of a role the Soviets played in either of the recent transitions. <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has pledged not to interfere in the affairs of his Eastern European allies, but his reforms undoubtedly increased pressure on both <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s departure leaves <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, in power since 1954, as the only Soviet bloc leader from the 1950s still in office. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who so far has refused to follow <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political and economic reforms, both are 75 and likely will come under increased pressure to step down. They may be more willing to do so now that <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> have shown that it is possible to relinquish the top party post while still remaining on the political scene, albeit with diminished power. But it is unlikely that either will face such public criticism as <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who in the past two decades tolerated a degree of open discussion rare in the Soviet bloc until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> in March 1985. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s relative openness was in full display at the three-day conference, where several delegates voiced demands for radical reform. They wound up sweeping from power many aging party officials, including eight Politburo members. The changes leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with a young and untried ruling body that contains two women, a novelty in the Soviet bloc. The average age of the 11 new Politburo members is 52. Only three men have been members since 1985, two were promoted in a party reshuffle last June and six new members were added Sunday. Another Soviet bloc rarity was the promotion to the Politburo of a former member of the body, <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>. Dubbed the father of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s pioneering economic reforms in the 1960s, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing too hard for more changes. The promotion to the ruling body of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, an outspoken advocate of referendums on key issues and dialogue with independent political groups, may be designed to muzzle their most radical public statements. But it also signals <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' readiness to take reformists into the top echelons of power, guaranteeing them input into a policy to tackle <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis and restore public confidence in the party.

 <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, has built a reputation as a canny, pragmatic politician with a charisma not unlike that of his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, 57, succeeded <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> on Sunday as general secretary during an overhaul of the party leadership. After becoming premier in June, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> established himself as a politician willing to tackle unpleasant economic issues while softening the blow of austerity measures with the promise of political reform. He has moved around the country, chatting with workers and apparently enjoying interviews with journalists from the state-run media. During a visit last month to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, he proved to be an unabashed admirer of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. These tactics overshadowed party ideologist <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s main rival in the battle to become party chief, and <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> himself, who was left to shoulder the blame for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. Like <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is two years his junior, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> comes from an impeccable background and got his start in politics during the turbulent times of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s death in 1953. Official biographies say <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was born into a worker's family in 1930 in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Miskolc </LOCATION>. A Communist by 1945, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> followed his mother into work in a print shop. By 1949, he was in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> with the national party youth organization. Seizing a chance for promotion and education, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> entered the country's <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1950s, training as an officer for the Hungarian army, whose upper ranks had fallen victim to sweeping Stalinist purges. Within a year, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was a deputy lieutenant. He then served as full lieutenant stationed near the Yugoslav border who also was charged with the political education of his battalion. In November 1954, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was discharged from the army and sent to <ORGANIZATION> Borsod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to observe party organizations, factories and coal mines in his native Miskolc. Official accounts suggest <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> spent the turbulent year of 1956 in <LOCATION> Miskolc </LOCATION>, removed from the turmoil in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> emerged as undisputed leader after Soviet troops crushed an anti-Stalinist revolt and arrested liberal leader <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>. By 1961, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> had moved up to the central apparatus of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after a spell at the party academy and was named party head at state-run radio and television. Between 1968 and 1973, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was deputy head of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> propaganda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, and from 1974 to 1979 was in full charge of the official propaganda machine He returned to <LOCATION> Borsod </LOCATION> as regional party head in 1979, and in December 1984 advanced to head the influential <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> party, which contains almost one quarter of the nation's 800,000 communists. At the national party congress in March 1985, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was elevated to the ruling party Politburo. When <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> was named premier, he almost immediately acknowledged that some political reform was needed to complement stringent economic measures he pushed to control mounting foreign debt. He pushed through the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first value-added and personal income taxes, designed to deregulate price controls and tap the income from the second jobs many Hungarians hold to make ends meet. Although his austerity program is to last until 1990, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has stressed there is no target date for overcoming <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has outlined vague plans for parliament to have a larger and more supervisory role in government decision-making, and even countenanced dialogue with unofficial opposition groups who do not contest Communist rule. `` This government is not likely to go down in history as one of the victorious,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said last fall, `` but if we can succeed, we will be praised for taking an interest in the country.''

<HEAD>Writers, Producers to Meet With Federal Mediator</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Meeting begins at 5 p.m. EDT; lede prospects unlikely</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A scriptwriters' strike against movie and TV producers entered its 12th week with potential for a break as a federal mediator called both sides together for the first formal talks in more than a month. The meeting between representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> was set this afternoon. It was the third such effort and the first since a 20-minute session April 18. Recent informal discussions between the sides came to nothing, said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an Alliance spokesman. Both sides have suffered from the walkout, which began March 7 over issues of payments for reruns, works distributed in foreign countries and creative control. The meeting was set only four days before guild members were scheduled to vote on proposed contracts with up to 24 independent producers. The vote could provide much-needed jobs for a substantial number of writers, said guild spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. Leaders of the 9,000-member union have granted only two waivers to independent producers but are recommending that West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members ratify the independent contracts in hopes of shortening the walkout, she said. `` It's showing that the proposals of the guild are reasonable and that businesses feel they can conduct their business profitably with those contracts,'' she said. But <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said: `` They've been saying that for 12 weeks, and we've been telling them their reasoning is unreasonable. ... There ca n't be a settlement if they're coming and demanding more.'' `` So far the only independents they've signed are none. Even the independents find their deal too difficult to swallow,'' he said, citing a decision by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Tonight Show'' to broadcast shows despite the strike. On April 14, the union approved independent contracts with the `` New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> Productions, which has produced such movies as `` Ghostbusters'' and `` Animal House.'' Although other independent contracts were considered, the guild voted against approval at the time. Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said more than 150 producers have asked to negotiate with the guild for independent contracts. None of the independents who negotiated separate deals are among the 200 represented by the alliance, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the signing of the independents would not affect negotiations, because they represent less than 10 percent of feature film and 15 percent of television production. Producers say the strike has cost the industry more than $ 15 million in lost jobs and production time, with about 1,400 clerical workers, cast and crew members laid off due to the stop in scripts.

 Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dropped slightly today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and the dollar also fell after moving in a narrow range in lackluster and trendless trading. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 144.09 points, or 0.52 percent, after recovering some of its morning losses in the afternoon session. It closed the trading day at 27,249.76 points. The main market barometer had lost 248.79 points by the end of the morning session. Nothing really affected the stock market, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, vice president of the Japanese equities department at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has to open all by itself Monday mornings,'' <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said. `` There's not really any market-moving news.'' He added that the `` stock market was very shaky in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> last week, which caused a general sell-off -LRB- in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' Volume share in the first section of the <ORGANIZATION> TSE </ORGANIZATION> was 700 million shares, down from its last Friday's 800-million-share total. In foreign exchange dealings, meanwhile, the dollar closed at 124.80 yen, down 0.02 yen from its last week close, but slightly higher than its opening today at 124.78 yen. The currency fluctuated in a narrow range between 124.71 yen and 124.82 yen during the day. `` With no specific market-moving incentives at hand, the dollar remains in a narrow range,'' said an exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that market participants were trying to keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency at a low 124-yen level. ` We're likely leading to a period where Japanese trade surpluses will be higher again, and we're concerned about that,'' <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said. `` Also the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does seem to have inflation problems ... On that basis the yen should be higher than the dollar,'' he added.

<HEAD>Economic Plan Would Turn Japan's Strength Inward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic strategists today gave Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a five-year plan urging that the Japanese economy be directed at increasing domestic demand and reducing the country's massive trade surplus. The plan, made public after six months of research at <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s behest, puts an official imprimatur on the recent shift in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy, which achieved vibrant growth last year mostly on a boom in domestic housing rather than the traditional method of expanding exports. A summary of the plan for 1988 through 1992 said three major economic problems `` can all be resolved by promoting and consolidating the shift to a domestic-demand-led economy.'' The problems, it said, were how to reduce <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus, how to improve the quality of life for the 122 million Japanese and how to promote `` balanced national economic and social development.'' If the plan's aims are attained, it should please <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trading partners like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who have complained for years that the export-minded Japanese were n't taking effective measures to reduce trade <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a task force reporting to the prime minister, to produce a five-year plan last November shortly after he succeeded <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. The chairman of the council, <PERSON> Gaishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiraiwa </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in a briefing that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s previous 10 economic plans since 1955 had aimed at quantitative expansion, but the new plan envisions the transformation of economic structure and tries to attain `` qualitative enhancement. Attaining the goals will mean `` pain and burden to the people at large,'' he said. `` Therefore, I believe that the understanding and cooperation of the Japanese people are needed more than ever.'' The plan will be debated by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet in coming weeks and its general outlines are expected to guide <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic development. The plan's directions are similar to those in a 1986 economic report requested by <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. The Maekawa Report, compiled by a panel headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maekawa </PERSON>, also recommended a shift away from export industries to domestic demand _ the direction the economy has taken _ but did n't achieve the status of a report approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The new plan predicts real economic growth averaging 3.75 percent annually over the five years. Domestic demand would provide a 4.25-percent average growth rate, it said, while exports would provide negative growth of a half-percent annually. It offers no target for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surpluses of trade and payments, saying instead they should reach `` internationally harmonious levels during the period of the plan.'' In the fiscal year ended March 31, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus dropped for the first time in eight years, from $ 89.7 billion in 1986-87 to $ 76 billion in 1987-88, according to government statistics. The high value of the yen, which has doubled against the dollar in the past three years, has increased the Japanese appetite for foreign goods while making Japanese exports more costly in overseas markets. Last year, for instance, Japanese automakers fell slightly short of their government-set quota of 2.3 million cars exported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because Japanese cars are no longer so much of a bargain for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyers. The plan urges the introduction of the five-day, 40-hour workweek _ now many Japanese work six days a week. For foreign countries, the new economic plan offers the following directions: _ Improving access to the Japanese market so that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is `` a land of business opportunity for the world at large. _ `` Contributing to a better world'' through trade and investment and by increasing foreign aid and capital-recycling to developing countries. _ Contributing to stabilization of the international currency markets by cooperating with other leading industrial countries on economic policy

 A 2,000-pound great white shark caught off of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> drew lots of nibbles but no bites until a collector hooked it for $ 600, a fish seller said. A weeklong crowd of gawkers, restaurant owners and taxidermists paraded through the freezer of <ORGANIZATION> Galletti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Terminal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, giving manager <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> headaches but no sales. `` It's time to get rid of that thing,'' he said. `` I'm tired of answering phones. It's taking away from my regular business.'' A collector who wanted the jaws finally bought it on Thursday, said <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>. The fish broker said he initially had hoped to get $ 1,500 for the shark because of publicity surrounding its May 13th capture about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> said he could not sell the meat because the fish had been dead too long to cut into steaks, and anyway, many people refuse to eat great whites. The Aggressor, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> fishing boat owned by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipich </PERSON>, snared the shark in gill nets a few days after a great white spotted in shallow water off <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> prompted authorities to close beaches.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is the kind of guy who's fun to hang out with but has no business being in the White House `` In life there are some people you meet whom you'd just like to pal around with.

<HEAD>New Wave Of Rioting Breaks Out In Kwangju</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of protesters hurled firebombs, battled riot squads and stormed three police stations in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> today in the latest wave of anti-government unrest, police said. Students shouting `` Down with the military'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' smashed windows and doors of the stations in the city before they were driven off by poice, authorities said. About 3,000 protesters later battled police near <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after trying to march off campus. Students surged out of the university gates and pelted police with rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing gasoline. Police in riot gear drove them back with tear gas. Police said 23 protesters had been arrested, but declined to say whether there were injuries. The clashes came as radical groups continued to press for a full investigation into the army's bloody suppression of a 1980 revolt in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which at least 191 people were killed. Radicals have clashed with police for six straight days in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 165 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Hundreds of students from colleges across the nation have poured into the city in recent days to take part in protests. Other parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were reported quiet today, a national holiday marking the birth of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>. On Sunday, 1,200 students hurled rocks at police near <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Police in riot gear fired tear gas to drive the protesters back into the school. National police remained on nationwide alert against renewed protests. Riot police squadrons guarded key government buildings in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other major cities. A series of demonstrations last week were the worst political unrest since nationwide anti-government violence last summer forced the government to agree to presidential elections and broad reforms. Radical students and dissidents took to the streets on the May 18 anniversary of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising and called for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government. Protesters contend that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a top general in 1980, played a key role in suppressing the revolt. They demand that he be investigated and punished. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won the presidency in December without receiving a majority of the vote after two opposition candidates split the anti-government balloting. The new government has introduced broad democratic reforms, but radical groups remain determined to oust the administration. The demostrations have been strongly anti-American, with radical students claiming the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government in power. Protesters called for the removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. Police officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today said that seven students who attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy with bombs Friday had been formally charged with assault and illegally demonstrating. A police officer and two students were hurt in the incident, but there was no damage to the embassy. The officials, who declined to be identified, said they were hunting for two other students believed to have masterminded the attack.

<TEXT>
 Some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future chemists and physicists applied scientific principles to solving puzzles that included dropping raw eggs and slowing the ascent of balloons. About 1,200 junior and senior high school students from 36 states, who had already competed in local, state and regional contests, met here Saturday for the fourth annual National Science Olympiad. Junior high students competed in 22 events and high school students entered 23 events. The competition was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. `` This Science Olympiad is the first thing I've seen in the last 18 years that has stimulated the minds of these students,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Goslein </PERSON>, an assiciate dean of instruction at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who presided at the balloon race. Two <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> teen-agers used motor oil, dough and foam to cushion the landing of a raw egg dropped 25 feet to win the Naked Egg Drop. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, both 16 and from <LOCATION> Tift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- High School, said the key was the motor oil blended into the half-inch thick cushion. In the competition, medium-size raw eggs were dropped from great heights and caught with cushion containers designed to keep the shells intact. Cushion materials included marshmallow, peanut butter, Jell-O, raspberry jam, wet towels, axle grease, noodles on cotton, and soggy whole white bread on plastic foam. `` The problem was n't really keeping it from cracking but keeping it from bouncing off,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` The motor oil ... made it stick. It just sat there in the motor oil.'' In the balloon race, students dreamed up ways of slowing the ascent of balloons from the floor to a ceiling finish-line. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinsen </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and schoolmate <PERSON> Hungman </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, a junior, designed an accordion-shaped construction-paper anchor for their balloon. `` First you find the area of density of a piece of paper and then you find the buoyant force of the balloon,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Martinsen </PERSON>, who sat at a table in front of a scale, `` and then with math you find out how much paper you need to counteract the buoyant force of the balloon.'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinsen </PERSON> had flown to the competition from <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where she participated in a three-day <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> and Science Symposium. She was worried the two events would make her fall behind at school. `` When I get back I have five days to catch up on everything and then graduate,'' she said. Not all the events were strictly scientific. Eighth-grader <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Caesar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, fashioned a bass fiddle from a potato chip can, broomstick handle and venetian blind cord for a competition called the Sound of Music. All contestants were required to play `` America the Beautiful'' on instruments from nonmusical objects. At the end, they formed their own orchestra. In addition to winners in the individual events, the school with the highest point total captured the division. <LOCATION> Haverford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- High School won the senior division, while <ORGANIZATION> Campus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irmo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, captured the junior division title.

<HEAD>Firestone, URW End Strike; Goodyear Pact Ratified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 4,700 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> workers were returning to work in six states today after company and union negotiators reached a tentative agreement that ended a week-old strike. Meanwhile, a contract covering 15,000 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers was ratified Sunday when a local in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> approved the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union officials said. A tentative agreement was reached Tuesday, and nine of 11 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> locals have approved the contract. One local rejected it and workers in <LOCATION> Gadsen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, vote today, union spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Union officials were optimistic about the Firestone agreement reached early Sunday, but some workers remained suspicious as they beagn returning to work night. `` There are a lot of people uneasy about it, going back to the plant and building up -LRB- an inventory of -RRB- tires without knowing what's going to happen in a couple of weeks,'' said union member <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> struck Firestone May 15 after the company refused to accept the cost-of-living allowance provided in an industry pattern agreement the union negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. The three-year Firestone contract followed the revised <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> pattern, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aucott </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s tire operations, called the agreement `` fair and realistic,'' and added that it `` recognizes the particular needs of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>'s tire operation.'' The Firestone agreement would: _ Maintain cost-of-living allowances in each year, with a 1-cent increase for every increase of 26-hundredths of a point in the Consumer Price Index _ Boost wages 25 cents per hour by deducting that amount from future cost-of-living adjustments in increments of 10 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents _ Increase retirement pensions for current workers by $ 3.50 to $ 23.50 per month for each year of service In addition, current retirees would receive a lump sum bonus of $ 200 before Dec. 1. The pact also assures continuation of the contract if a Firestone plant is sold to another company during the next three years, and contains a no-strike wage reopener clause in the third year. Ratification votes on the Firestone pact should be held this week at company offices and plants in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, Ark.; and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> plants make tires; the <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION> plant makes molded rubber products, and the <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION> plant makes innertubes.

<HEAD>66 Women Vie For Miss Universe Title In Taiwan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixty-six women will vie for the Miss Universe crown Tuesday at a suburban sports stadium in a glittery program brought to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> after the government lifted a 23-year-old ban on beauty contests. The 37th-annual Miss Universe pageant was scheduled for 9 a.m. -LRB- 9 p.m. EDT Monday -RRB- so it can be broadcast live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Consequently, the audience in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> will be forced to wear tuxedos and evening gowns at a time more appropriate for breakfast. Contestants include Miss USA <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Miss Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jade </PERSON> <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Organizers estimated 600 million people in 57 countries would watch the program on television to see who would succeed 1987 Miss Universe <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolocco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, and win more than $ 250,000 in cash and prizes. About 20 percent of 9,000 seats at <LOCATION> Linkou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> remained unsold as of Monday afternoon, local pageant organizers said. Beauty pageants were banned in 1964 by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government leaders who viewed the contests as an extravagance for a poor, developing nation. They also were dismayed by reports that a Miss <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> winner performed strip dances in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is now a prosperous, newly industrialized country and authorities in October 1987 lifted the ban to clear the way for a domestic airline to sponsor the Miss Universe pageant despite lingering opposition from a few groups. Feminists have demonstrated against the lifting of the ban while some retired soldiers angrily denounce the pageants as a waste of money and an insult to mothers. The telecast generally is viewed in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a rare opportunity to present the island to a worldwide audience as the Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the official name of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> seldom used internationally because most country's recognize the rival communist Chinese government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Organizers pledged to refer to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as the Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the telecast and promised the two-hour program would have 30 minutes of videotapes taken during recent weeks of the contestants at <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s scenic spots. The Miss Universe pageant generated much interest in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> this month but was pushed into the background last week when the island's most violent protest in recent years broke out in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> after a demonstration demanding increased government assistance to farmers. The 18-hour street battle between protesters and police that ended at dawn Saturday left more than 200 people injured and nearly 100 demonstrators detained. Missing from this year's Miss Universe pageant is long-time host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, who resigned after last year's competition in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to protest the awarding of fur coats to winners. He was replaced by television personality <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON>. The 11 celebrity judges include <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeana </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, who made history with their round-the-world, non-stop flight aboard the Voyager two years ago, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttan </PERSON> of the television series `` <LOCATION> L.A </LOCATION>. Law.'' Prizes for the 1988 Miss Universe include $ 76,000 in cash, a Maserati convertible automobile, and a mink coat and mink jacket.

<TEXT>
 A woman who staged a sale of items owned by the late author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> says the sale was so successful she will produce a sequel in mid-June. About 60 percent of the estate was sold, said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, who put together the auction of <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> goods inspected by an estimated 12,000 people on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. `` If we had reduced prices, everything would be gone,'' she said. Most estates are liquidated in three days, but Link and <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s two sons decided not to drop the prices. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> has said he probably will release more of his father's items for sale, <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. The day before the June sale will be reserved for students, who showed great interest in <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> items, she said. Link did n't know late Sunday how much money was raised at the weekend sale. The lowest-priced items sold were cards for $ 5, and the most expensive was a $ 4,200 desk, she said. Among the items left were a $ 5,200 Chippendale corner cupboard, paintings that ranged in price from $ 300 to $ 6,000, and lamps with prices starting at $ 300. Buyers purchased wine glasses, bow ties, a desk and a baptismal gown.

<HEAD>Government Orders Closings After Series Of Earthquakes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government ordered schools, government offices and businesses in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to close today after dozens of small and moderate earthquakes shook the area in recent days. The quakes have caused considerable alarm among the 2.8 million residents of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the surrounding <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> province, but no injuries or serious damage have been reported. On Sunday, Communications Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> announced that public buildings and businesses in the capital must close today only as a precaution `` because of the situation caused by the constant and continuous earthquakes.'' The action was taken, he said, `` to avoid any -LRB- traffic -RRB- congestion and so that families can be together in their homes.'' The order does not affect essential services, such as hospitals and the international airport. Col. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, initially reported that just public and private schools would be closed today, but the order was later expanded to include businesses. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> recorded 22 earthquakes on Saturday and an additional 22 temblors by late Sunday evening. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the strongest quakes, two occurring Sunday afternoon, registered 4.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Some local radio stations reported the Sunday quakes caused cracks in some houses and broken windows in the downtown commercial area. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake with a magnitude of 4 can cause moderate damage. The seismological service measured 22 quakes on Saturday, with the strongest registering 4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The epicenter of the quakes was on the southwestern edge of the capital near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. On Thursday, a quake registering 4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was felt in the area. A quake measuring 7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale devastated the capital on Feb. 4, 1976, causing more than 22,000 deaths.

<TEXT>
 Some 200 police officers were converging on the state capital for the signing of a gun control law that makes <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> the first state to ban the sale of Saturday Night Specials. White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was invited to watch Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> sign the bill into law today. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, was scheduled to be the main speaker for the State House ceremony. She became active in gun control efforts after her husband was seriously wounded in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981 Legislative leaders and other top officials who helped push the bill through the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last month were to join dozens of other invited guests, including police officers from neighboring states, for the ceremony. <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> aides say the ceremony was not intended as a show of force to pro-gun groups that are collecting signatures on petitions to place the bill on the ballot for a public vote in November. Rather, the aides said, the ceremony was a way of sharing the moment with the many people who helped get the bill passed despite fierce opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> gun groups. After losing to gun control forces in the legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and other gun groups began a campaign to petition the bill to referendum and persuade the voters to reject it in November. They say they are confident they can obtain enough signatures to get the measure on the ballot. State officials say the bill is unique because it creates a board to determine which handguns can be sold in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> beginning in 1990. It will not be illegal to possess guns that have not been approved by the review board, but it will be against the law for anyone to sell weapons not on the approved list. The law is primarily aimed at cheap handguns, known as Saturday Night Specials, that are often used in street crimes and are the weapon of choice for young criminals. The review board also is directed to omit from the list of approved guns any weapons that have the serial number removed or altered and guns made primarily of plastic that are n't easily detected by metal detectors.

 Nine foreign securities firms, including six from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, began trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The nine were among 22 firms, 16 of them non-Japanese, that were authorized last week to begin trading today on the exchange. The others will join the market by June as they become ready. `` Of the 122 firms authorized to trade on the exchange, foreign companies now number 22, or about 20 percent,'' said <PERSON> Toshiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Konuma </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the exchange's board of directors. `` As we internationalize the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> exchange, it has become necessary to align the needs and desires of foreign firms with the longstanding habits of Japanese traders,'' he said in an interview. The first six foreign members of the exchange joined in 1986 after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> put strong pressure on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to liberalize its equities markets. The 22 were among 40 firms that applied for membership. `` To participate in transactions on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, it is very important to be a member,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedford </PERSON>, managing director of Japanese equities for <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the American firms that began trading today. `` It's very difficult to be accepted by domestic institutions.

<TEXT>
 A substitute teacher hailed by police as a hero in an elementary school shooting spree says she thought the assailant was a classroom observer before the woman brandished a handgun. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 29, says she tried to share with <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> the excitement the second-graders had over an upcoming bicycle safety test at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I really wanted her to know why the children were so happy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> recalled at a news conference Sunday. `` My impression at the moment was that she was a college student who had come to the school to observe the class, which is not unusual,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> sat next to her for a while Friday before leaving the classroom and later returning, apparently after going into a boys' restroom and shooting <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trossman </PERSON>, 6 Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, a baby sitter with a history of `` bizarre'' behavior, then told Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> to herd the 24 children in her class together. Instead, Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> grabbed the woman's gunhand. But Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> pulled a second gun, sprayed the classroom with bullets and then fled. Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 30, shot five students in the classroom, killing one and seriously wounding the others. <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said if Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> had followed the assailant's orders, `` We would have probably had all of the children shot.'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> called Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> a hero. `` I really just went on automatic pilot. ... I ca n't explain how unreal the whole situation was,'' Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> said, adding that the gun looked like a toy at first. But after the initial shot, she said, `` I was just frozen. `` When the first child went down, my first thought was, ` They're filming a movie and they forgot to tell me. It was n't until the second shot that we all realized it was real.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s face was `` expressionless'' and `` hard,'' she said. Police also credited Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> with giving a full description of the assailant, who later barricaded herself in a suburban home where she wounded a 20-year-old man and killed herself. Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> said she would return to the school. `` I love <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, who has worked there in various capacities for the past five years and is studying toward a master's degree in education. `` I know the faculty, the administration and a lot of the children and some of the parents. ... I feel like the support system will be real helpful to me. The children and the families _ everyone has been wonderful.''

The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the testing program, prohibits blasts under certain weather conditions. The nuclear warhead was detonated about 1,200 feet underground as seven Soviet scientists spent the weekend in Mercury, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, about 32 miles from ground zero. The town houses test site workers. The Soviets are preparing for a joint experiment later this summer in which the Soviets will monitor a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> test. More than two dozen American scientists also are at the Soviet test site, preparing to monitor a Soviet blast. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there was considerable ground motion noted by observers in a building eight miles from ground zero. The test was not as large as the 150-kiloton maximum limit adhered to by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> would not reveal the weapon's power. The blast appeared normal, he said, with no indications that radioactivity had escaped the underground cavern. The test was the fourth announced this year and the 679th announced test since testing began in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> in January 1951.

 Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today released details of a five-year federal budget proposal which would increase taxes on the wealthy by $ 244 billion, cut defense spending by $ 164 billion and increase spending on social programs by $ 344 billion. `` We must forge a mandate to reverse Reaganomics,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a written statement accompanying his budget blueprint. The spending plan, called `` Paying for Our Dreams, A Budget Plan for Jobs, Peace and Justice,'' also calls for $ 87 billion in cuts in projected spending on non-defense programs and $ 104 billion in tax increases on corporations. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his proposals would also cut the nation's deficit from a projected $ 134 billion in 1993 to $ 49 billion. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled release of his budget proposal for an appearance at <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s state capitol, one of many campaign stops <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is making in a bid for the state's 314 delegates up for grabs in the June 7 primary. Repeating a campaign theme, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would raise up to $ 58 billion a year for social programs such as housing, education and health care by freezing the military budget at its current $ 300 billion level for the next five years. `` If we do not propose bold alternatives, our social needs will fall victim to the soldiers of austerity which were, in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>'s phrase, hidden in the Trojan Horse of supply side economics,'' he said, referring to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first budget director. `` I am for a strong defense. I also support a sound approach to the military budget. Our plan would freeze military spending,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in the prepared statement. `` Even after the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> cuts, real military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 1980.'' The biggest tax increase in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s budget plan would restore the top 38.5 percent income tax rate on the nation's top 600,000 taxpayers. Other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax rate on corporations, limit deductions for business meals to 50 percent, and impose a $ 7-billion-a-year `` polluters tax'' on corporations. Among his proposed spending increases, described as `` new investments,'' are programs which by 1993 would spend an extra $ 20 billion annually on education and job training, $ 17 billion on housing programs, $ 12 billion on health and nutrition programs and $ 3 billion more annually on AIDS programs. It also includes $ 5 billion more in transportation funding, $ 1.7 billion annually on environmental programs and $ 1 billion more annually for international economic assistance. `` The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget chooses social and economic investment over military spending, restores a measure of tax progressivity, and promotes a balanced mix of monetary and fiscal policy. These choices can only help the economy,'' he said. Following release of his budget proposal, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> scheduled a visit to the nearby <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, on the invitation of critics of that plant who are sponsoring a ballot initiative to mandate permanent closing of the publicly owned reactor. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was continuing his campaign Sunday while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took weekend breathers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined a rally of striking <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> at a <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION> frozen foods processing plant on Sunday and administered wedding vows to the daughter of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> educator who is a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He told striking workers they are `` victims of economic violence,'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should stand with them by adopting his 10-point plan for `` democracy in the work place.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` must stand with the working people. It's the legacy of -LRB- President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> -RRB- Roosevelt It's the unfinished business of Dr. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- King,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, by contrast, had offered an economic vision that `` is very conservative, very cautious, very inadequate.'' `` The present conservative commitment by Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to economic change represents no hope for the homeless, no hope for the homeless, the uneducated,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> administered wedding vows to the daughter of <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, who has been held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since Jan. 24, 1987. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he hoped by participating in the wedding of <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, a 26-year-old paramedic in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Monday </PERSON>, a 33-year-old <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> fireman, that `` in some unlit corner of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, this news may reach and cheer a hostage.'' `` We will not rest until all the hostages are set free. We will not rest until the whole <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is set free, because the whole <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is held hostage,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said as he introduced the newlyweds at a campaign rally immediately after administering their vows.

<HEAD>Syria Rejects Deal With Iran; Shiite Fighting Moves Into 18th Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> rejected an Iranian offer to form a joint military force to end the protracted fighting between two Shiite Moslem factions in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums, two newspapers reported today. The 18 foreign hostages believed held in the slums were a key factor in the negotiations between the two countries, one of the newspapers said. Police said the Syrian-backed Amal militia and pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> forces battled for an 18th straight day today, trading fire with rockets and mortars and leaving five people dead and 46 wounded. The two factions are fighting for control of the 16 square miles of slums. At least 271 people have been killed and 919 wounded since the fighting broke out May 6. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has proposed forming a joint military force with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and moving into the slums to stop the fighting, according to reports today in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s two leading dailies, the independent An-Nahar and the leftist As-Safir. The papers said that Amal officials and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, rejected the offer and insisted that the Syrian army take exclusive charge of security in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The papers said the Iranian offer was proposed by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> during an overnight meeting with <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> officials. Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, also reportedly attended the meeting. An-Nahar said <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> also declared two conditions for approving a Syrian military intervention in the slums. They were: _ Resolving the problem of the hostages, who include nine Americans, `` in a way that serves the objective for which they were kidnapped. He did not elaborate, but said it was a `` vital issue for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' _ Guarantees that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> would be free to continue political activities in the slums after the Syrian deployment The two dailies said the differences probably will delay the entry of Syrian troops into the slums while further contacts were made between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and Iranian President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has had 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles massed around the slums since Sunday, after <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> overran Amal strongholds and seized control of 90 percent of the urban battleground. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s drive, through <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites has strained that alliance. The Syrians consider <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to be within their sphere of influence and vital to their security. Amal spokesmen have complained publicly that delaying the Syrian deployment will only prolong the plight of thousands of civilians trapped in the slums. The Syrians, while seeking to avoid a confrontation with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, appear determined to send their troops into south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, long a haven for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers, hijackers and assassins. `` There's no way to stop the fighting other than a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> military deployment,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said in a statement broadcast Sunday by <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> radio stations. He did not set a specific deadline for deployment in the labyrinthine slums. But he noted: `` By the time we deploy, I hope there will be no hostages left in captivity.'' He did not elaborate. Most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held by exteremists linked to <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has warned that `` any harm befalling the hostages will be regarded as an aggressive act against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Victim's Family Thought of Revenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The family of a woman strangled in Central Park says feelings of hate were strong enough to trigger thoughts of killing <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, the man convicted in the so-called `` preppy murder'' case. `` You go through a hundred feelings, a thousand feelings and a thousand emotions when you lose a child. But it's a different thing altogether when you lose a child by the hands of another,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, the mother of <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. `` You have feelings that you want to kill him and you have feelings that you want to kill yourself,'' she said in an interview broadcast Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` News Forum.'' `` There's a big revenge feeling inside you. You have to work through these things, but the hate is there and the hate is real.'' Chambers was charged with murder for the Aug. 26, 1986, strangulation of Miss <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>. The body of the 18-year-old was found near the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Chambers, 21, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on March 21 and is serving a five-to-15 year prison sentence. Mrs. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said that while family members grieved their loss, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> was free to walk around town and enjoy himself as he awaited trial. `` He even had the audacity to come down to <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>'s neighborhood and was seen in a local restaurant, two blocks from her home, cavorting with his friends and drinking and having a great time,'' she said `` All of this while we'd go to visit her at her grave.'' It was that image that triggered thoughts of revenge in all members of the <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> family, she said. With effort, Mrs. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said, family members finally came to terms with their feelings. `` We had to _ we're civilized people.''

<HEAD>Activists Stage Demonstration In Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Lithuanians defied government warnings and staged a demonstration in the Baltic republic to commemorate deportations of their countrymen 40 years ago, dissidents and official media reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said about 300 people gathered to shout anti-Soviet slogans on a central square of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the Lithuanian capital. `` Extremist elements, who do not like processes of democratization and renovation of society which are under way in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>, today made an attempt to stage an anti-social manifestation in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said in describing Sunday's protest Telephone calls to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> did not go through, so there was no way to verify the information directly. However, one Moscow-based dissident, <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Senderov </PERSON>, said he learned from phone contacts with the region that a demonstration occurred. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> activist, today said several leading <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activists were held under house arrest to prevent participation in the rally. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said no one was detained in Sunday's protest even though some people `` violated public order.'' On Saturday, local authorities organized an official rally in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, apparently to try to head off the unsanctioned protest. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said thousands of people gathered then to pay tribute to the `` innocent victims of the violation of laws during the years of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s personality cult.'' A New York-based group called <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> had reported last week that Lithuanian human rights activists planned to demonstrate in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>' Gediminas Square to pay tribute to an estimated 200,000 Lithuanian, Polish and Jewish people deported to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> in May 1948 at the order of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The group said <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> city officials summoned four activists to a meeting on Thursday to warn them against staging a demonstration. Other nationalist demonstrations were held in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> in February. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was part of the Russian Empire until the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, when it gained independence. It was included in the Soviet sphere of influence in a secret agreement between <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> before World War II. The Soviet military moved in to take control in 1940. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the two other Baltic republics, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, as parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Parliament Member, Two Blacks Killed In Separate Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of the mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was gunned down in a church parking lot near here, and two blacks died in a bomb blast at a political rally in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> today said police had no evidence that the slaying of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a member of the majority <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, was politically motivated. `` The police have no reason at this stage to believe that the murder was committed for political considerations but are investigating the possibility that clashing personal interests could have led to the crime,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 42, was shot in the chest after getting into his car in a church parking lot following a meeting Sunday night near his home in <LOCATION> Alberton </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. According to press reports, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' wife and two other men were with him in the car when a black assailant smashed the window on the driver's side and fired a 9mm pistol at <LOCATION> Jacobs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 after a new constitution was adopted creating segregated chambers for Asians and mixed-race people along with the existing chamber for whites. The new constitution continued to exclude the black majority from national politics. Anti-apartheid activists of all races organized a boycott of the Asian and mixed-race elections which helped keep the turnout below 20 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has remained estranged from the mainstream of the anti-apartheid movement. However, its leader, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, has taken an increasingly confrontational stance toward President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in the past year, demanding abolition of the legislation which establishes racially segregated neighborhoods. In <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the explosion that killed two blacks also injured more than 30 during a Sunday afternoon rally held by the <ORGANIZATION> Sofasonke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said police spokesman <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>. The Sofasonke Party is active in municipal politics in the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Police were investigating the cause of the explosion at the outdoor gathering attended by about 100 people, the spokesman said. He said there were no arrests. Municipal elections are scheduled for October, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sofasonke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take part. Although blacks have no voice in national politics in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, they can vote in local township elections. Many black activists charge that the <ORGANIZATION> Sofasonke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is collaborating with the white-led government by participating in black municipal politics. <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON> said the meeting was a legal gathering that had been authorized in advance. Under emergency regulations, outdoor political gatherings are illegal unless prior permission is obtained from the courts.

<HEAD>FTC: Bogus Legal Group Took In $3.3 Million Fraudulently</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Atlanta-based group posing as a national prepaid legal services firm took in $ 3 million over a nine-month period, fooling nearly 400 would-be franchisees, federal officials say. The Lawyers Access Network sold distributorships for a prepaid legal services plan from March to December 1987, according to lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has been investigating the case. Prepaid legal services programs offer consumers basic legal services for a flat annual fee, rather than an hourly rate. The firm gathered $ 3.3 million from 392 people around the country who believed they were buying franchises by investing amounts ranging from $ 5,500 to $ 25,000, <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. The figure did not include any fees that might have been sent in by consumers, they said. At best, investors may recover only 10 percent of their investment, one <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> lawyer said. `` This thing makes the movie ` The Sting' look small-time,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuade </PERSON>, a public relations director in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> who paid a $ 25,000 franchise fee in order to market memberships in the network. `` It was so well set up,'' he said. `` They just had all their bases covered.'' The firm used false market research, baseless earnings projections and bogus references to lure purchasers into believing its program was successful, profitable and well-established, <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers say. In a series of legal actions that began in March, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has shut down Lawyers Access and its marketing arm, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operated out of the same office in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburbs. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> confiscated dozens of records from the office during a search. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> representatives brought fancy brochures and a hard-sell pitch to franchise shows nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also won a permanent injunction and default judgment for more than $ 3 million earlier this month against firm officials <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Pasley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said, `` The fact of the matter is, whatever representations that may have been made to -LRB- distributors -RRB- that turned out to not be true were not made by Mr. <PERSON> Pasley </PERSON> or with his knowledge.'' <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> claimed, `` I did n't set up the company; I was just an employee.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> signed an order freezing 13 bank accounts and other assets allegedly controlled by <PERSON> Pasley </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said, `` There does not seem to be a big pot of gold out there, at least that we or the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have been able to discover.'' The victims, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said, may at best receive restitution of 10 percent. `` Prepaid legal services is a growth industry, and a legitimate industry,'' <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> told the Atlanta Constitution. `` A legitimate plan along these lines might well be profitable. It's just these guys went too far.''

<HEAD>US Officials Present Zoo With Alaskan Musk Oxen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials formally presented the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo with two Alaskan musk oxen today as a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> woman who first suggested the gift beamed fondly at the shaggy animals. Four-year-old <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON>, a female, and 3-year-old <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION>, stood with lowered heads in their outdoor enclosure as a horde of diplomats, wildlife experts and reporters gathered on the other side of the fence. `` They're beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said of the 300-pound animals. Mrs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> began campaigning in 1980 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to present two musk oxen to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She felt it was a matter of `` national honor'' to replace two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> animals, given to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1972, that had died of old age. The original pair had been presented when President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> made his historic trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the two nations normalized relations. `` It took lots of letter-writing, lots of telephone calls and lots of trips, but I enjoyed all of it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I heard the Chinese children were very sad'' over the death of the original oxen, she said. `` So I had to find out what a musk ox was and ... How can you come by some.'' As the dignitaries dispersed for a banquet, <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> ate grass in their enclosure and Chinese zoo-goers moved in for a look. `` They're not bad,'' said a Chinese man in a baseball cap. <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION>, named after Alaskan rivers, were born in captivity in a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> research herd. About 3,000 to 4,000 of the rare, migratory animals live in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and other areas of the Arctic. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the pair probably would thrive in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> despite temperatures that sometimes soar into the 90s. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Undersecretary of Interior <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gjelde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> and more a dozen other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials attended the presentation. <PERSON> Gjelde </PERSON> called the oxen a `` fitting symbol'' of U.S.-Chinese friendship and the two countries' commitment to wildlife preservation. He read a message from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who said, `` May these musk oxen bring joy to the visitors of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo.'' `` We will do our best to keep them well,'' promised <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo Deputy Director <PERSON> Shi </PERSON> <PERSON> Senming </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tanana </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Koyuk </LOCATION> actually arrived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in late March but were in quarantine until today. To the untrained eye, they looked less than jubilant over the attention, alternately presenting horns to the onlookers and turning their heads away. `` They do n't have a wide range of expressions,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` That's pretty much the normal posture.'' He said in the wild musk oxen generally live to be 20 to 25. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave the original pair of musk oxen in exchange for giant pandas Ling-Ling and <LOCATION> Hsing-Hsing </LOCATION>, still in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Italian Neo-Facist Leader Dies At 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON>, a minor official in <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s last government and the founder of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s neo-fascist party, has died at the age of 73. <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON> died Sunday of complications from ischemia, a condition caused by arterial blockage, according to hospital officials quoted by the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>.

He was once charged with helping a right-wing terrorist, but the charges were dropped under a 1987 amnesty. His Italian Social Movement was the political heir to <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s fascist creation. By 1987, it had had become <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest party in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, holding 5.9 percent of the seats in the Chamber of Deputies Another former party leader and founder, <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> <PERSON> Romualdi </PERSON>, died of cancer Friday. The 77-year-old editor of the party newspaper was elected to the Chamber of Deputies seven times between 1953 and 1979 and was a senator from 1983 to 1987. The party announced a joint funeral for the Almirante and Romualdi Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION>, the Roman Catholic church in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON> <PERSON> Navona </PERSON> <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON>, born June 27, 1914, joined <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>'s last government in 1943 as chief of staff of the Ministry of Popular Culture.

In February 1979, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> waived <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON>'s parliamentary immunity so prosecutors could try him for reviving the political equivalent of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Fascist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> But he was re-elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the immunity-lifting process had to begin again. He never went to trial. Parliament waived his immunity again in 1981 and in 1984 so he could face charges of aiding and abetting a right-wing terrorist accused in a 1972 bombing that killed two Italian policemen. <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON> was accused of helping finance a surgical operation to change the vocal cords of a bombing suspect to dodge his identification by voice patterns. Those charges were dropped under a February 1987 amnesty that covered offenses that would bring less than three years punishment. In December, <PERSON> Almirante </PERSON> stepped down as national secretary of the neo-fascist party, which supports a halt to the influx of foreign immigrants into <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a stronger presidency and tougher measures against organized crime.

<TEXT>
 A year after a tornado leveled this farming town, a Catholic bishop walked through the almost-rebuilt community and blessed the houses, both old and new. On Sunday about 250 people gathered outside <PERSON> Saragosa </PERSON>'s cemetery to hear <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>'s memorial Mass to mark the first anniversary of the tornado that killed 30 people and injured 170 others. Standing under a cloudless sky, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> urged the survivors to thank <PERSON> God </PERSON> for the strength `` to bear our cross and to rebuild, not only our town, but also as we begin to rebuild our lives.'' The physical rebuilding of the Mexican-American community is almost complete. The tornado destroyed more than 60 houses, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> diocese rebuilt most of them. After Mass, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> walked around town and blessed all the houses. Among the structures destroyed by the tornado was the community center, which was filled at the time with friends and relatives attending a preschool graduation ceremony. Many of the victims _ some of them not even of school age _ died in the community center's rubble. The new center will house 300 in its basement tornado shelter. Also reduced to rubble was the church, whose brown brick replacement is scheduled for completion in late June. The new church, which will seat 276 in its sanctuary, will be designated a shrine to the Virgin of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>. It will be the first such shrine in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> diocese, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said, also has allocated more than $ 300,000 for counseling services over five years to help survivors recover from the tragedy. `` Psychologists tell us it takes five years for people to recover from a trauma of this type,'' the bishop said. `` The slightest little wind causes much fear in some people.'' Some <PERSON> Saragosans </PERSON> said they wanted to reiterate a message contained on a sign put up recently on the south edge of town by the side of Highway 17: `` Thank you, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, for helping rebuild <PERSON> Saragosa </PERSON>.'' `` We're all very happy,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivas </PERSON>, 34, of <PERSON> Saragosa </PERSON>. `` We thank people who helped us in one way or another. It's just a little town; it was n't even on the map. Now we have a lot of publicity everywhere.''

 The number of people killed in widespread flooding in east <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rain-drenched <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province has climbed to 78, a government official said today. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengpo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fuzhou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, reported the increased death toll and said he and other officials were monitoring the level of the swollen <LOCATION> Minjiang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> following heavy rains Friday and Saturday. He said the <LOCATION> Minjiang </LOCATION> had flooded near <LOCATION> Fuzhou </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, but Mayor <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongshi </PERSON> said no deaths had been reported in that area. The most serious flooding was in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province's northern counties of <LOCATION> Jianyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chongan </LOCATION> and Zhenghe, where the deaths occurred. More than 200 people were injured and more than 3,100 were forced to flee their homes, according to official media reports today. Officials reported Sunday that 60 people had been killed in the flooding. The nationally televised evening news showed residents wading through waist-high water carrying household goods over their heads, or poling through the streets on rafts of logs lashed together. The English language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said 19,760 acres were flooded, 900 homes were damaged, 400 sections of road were destroyed and 400 bridges were swept away. It said 12 inches of rain fell on one town in a 20-hour period, and that the water level of a major tributary of the Minjiang was 90 feet above normal. Fujian Vice Gov. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexin </PERSON> said Sunday that land transportation to north <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> was cut off and that Gov. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoguo </PERSON> had flown to the area to supervise rescue operations.

<TEXT>
 A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said today that ratification of a U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty is possible during the superpower summit that begins in six days but that some senators still have unanswered questions about the pact. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, interviewed on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' program about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty, requiring the destruction of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles, said: `` There are still some issues that senators -LRB- Jesse -RRB- <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> -LRB- R-N.C. -RRB-, -LRB- <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> -RRB- Wallop -LRB- R-Wyo. -RRB-, -LRB- <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> -LRB- R-Idaho -RRB- and others wish to be debated and those will take a good part of this week to conclude.'' He added that he thinks action is `` unlikely ... before the president leaves for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but said, `` I think it's still possible that the treaty could be ratified while he's there.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> begin five days of meetings Sunday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said failure to ratify the treaty would be a serious mistake. `` I think that the treaty is verifiable,'' he said. `` It's in our interest to proceed, and to reject the treaty, I think, would jeopardize not only our relationship with our allies but undermine the president's ability to continue to serve as a spokesman for this country.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday crushed a bid by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> right wing to tie the treaty to ending Soviet cheating on other arms control accords. All five sections of an amendment offered by <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> were overwhelmingly rejected and other attempts to change the treaty were rebuffed. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders indicated that ratification before the summit would be difficult. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he may keep the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> working late into the night this week and may schedule a Saturday Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., blamed the conservative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators for the delay, saying they do not want to see a successful summit `` The treaty is going to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It's just a question of whether we do it before or after the summit,'' <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said on the CBS show. `` I think people who are opposed to the treaty feel that if it is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before then, the summit will be successful and they do n't want a successful summit.''

 Vandals stenciled three red swastikas on a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> temple, marking the 44th anti-Semitic incident reported in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this year, according to an official of a Jewish anti-discrimination group. The phrase `` Die Jew'' was also spray-painted on a terrace leading to the entrance of the <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION>, police said. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning on the front of the modern-design synagogue. `` There is a great deal of prejudice and hatred in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, and this act shows that more integration between Anglos, blacks, Hispanics, Jews and gentiles needs to take place,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabachnikoff </PERSON>, rabbi at the 450-member temple. The temple was desecrated sometime between late Saturday and early Sunday, police said. There are no suspects. `` I do feel the attack was premeditated because of the stencils,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>, Southern area director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON> said he was concerned about the increase in anti-Semitic vandalism. A total of 44 incidents have been reported in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this year, compared with 64 last year. Vandalism was also discovered Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Killian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, about 1 -LCB- miles from the temple; vandals used a stencil to paint five red swastikas and the phrases `` Hitler Lives'' and `` Neo-Nazi Rules.'' Police said they did n't know whether the incident was related to that at the temple. Four teen-agers were recently sentenced in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juvenile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> to 200 hours of community service and ordered to pay $ 14,800 in damages for smashing windows and painting anti-Jewish slogans on another <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> temple Feb. 26.

<HEAD>No Mention Of `Killer Rabbit' In Carter's New Outdoor Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLIJAY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> says that on second thought, he probably should have included the `` killer rabbit'' episode in his new book on his outdoor adventures `` just to explain there was nothing to it.'' `` An Outdoor Journal: Adventures and Reflections,'' published by <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON> <PERSON> Books </PERSON>, portrays the former president as an avid hunter and fisherman who relishes the solitude and physical and intellectual stimulation the activities provide. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> writes vividly of stalking wild turkey in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> woods, bagging ducks in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, battling trophy rainbow trout in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and fighting a blue marlin in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. But the 224-page book, scheduled for release this week, omits the most famous outdoor adventure of his presidency _ the 1979 killer rabbit episode, in which he beat back with a paddle a rabbit he said was swimming toward his canoe during a fishing trip near <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. `` I guess I should have -LRB- included it -RRB- just to explain there was nothing to it,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in an interview at his mountain cabin near here last week. `` But I do n't want to get into another altercation with the press about it. That was a contrivance of the press.'' The episode prompted numerous editorial cartoons and jokes at <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s expense, and the rabbit was dubbed the `` killer rabbit'' or the `` banzai bunny.'' Some skeptics claimed that rabbits do not swim, but <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said a blowup of an official White House photograph showed the animal was clearly a rabbit. He told reporters at the time, `` It was a fairly robust-looking rabbit who was swimming, apparently with no difficulty.'' He said it would have been `` an unpleasant situation for me and the rabbit'' if the animal had gotten into the canoe.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today adopted a new platform for implementing Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and social reforms, the No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> official announced. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> told a foreign policy meeting the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had chosen <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the party general secretary, to present the blueprint to an important party conference next month. `` We have every reason to say that today's plenum has worked out a platform for the party to use in forging ahead to the all-union party conference,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said after the 2 -LCB- hour meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's 300-plus member policy-making body. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had a `` very interesting and lively debate,'' and then adopted the theses formulated by the ruling Politburo for the June 28 party conference. These, he said, `` thoroughly analyze'' developments since an April 1985 party plenum laid the theoretical basis for the 57-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms The platform also makes `` a number of important suggestions and proposals relative to the implementation of perestroika, glasnost, democratization and the implementation of a healthy political atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. The announcement of the plenum results by <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> could be one more sign that the 67-year-old ideology chief is not in serious political trouble. Reports of a major policy dispute between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> surfaced in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last month. The reports suggested <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> had endorsed publication in March of an article in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> that questioned whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms had gone too far. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has given speeches relecting a more conservative approach than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is chairman of the Commission on Foreign Affairs of the Soviet of the Union, one of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament. He reported on the plenum at the opening of a joint meeting of that commission and its counterpart in the other Supreme Soviet chamber, the Soviet of Nationalities. The commissions are considering whether to recommend ratification of the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles Plenary meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> often take place the day before the Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal parliament, holds its semiannual meetings. The 1,500-member legislature begins a meeting Tuesday that may include ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The plenum took place six days before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for his fourth meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to use the June 28 special party conference to tighten his hold on the party apparatus and to rout party officials hostile or indifferent to his ambitious program for `` perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring. In speeches earlier this year, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also has said the June conference will consider reforms to strengthen the legal and judicial systems. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for creating a system to replace aging party officials and has been especially critical of the 18-year rule of President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> as a period of stagnation and corruption. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisovolik </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> section of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, has said the party will consider limiting the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary to two or three eight-year terms. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in an interview last Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> that he endorsed the proposal. Membership on the ruling party Politburo can be changed at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum.

 The Israeli army today reopened hundreds of elementary schools in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after keeping them shut for nearly four months because of the Arab uprising. Military officials said the move was in response to a marked decline in violent incidents in the disputed territories in the last few weeks. On Sunday, however, three Palestinians died in one of the worst days of violence in the occupied territories this month. `` If they -LRB- the children -RRB- are in school then they wo n't be in the streets, but that is not what motivated us to open the schools,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> which runs daily affairs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> today. `` The whole education system was examined. Teachers who were connected with the rioting are not teachers today,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today heard an appeal by <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience, who asked the panel to scrap a deportation order against him. The court said it would rule at a later date. The government jailed <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> earlier this month and said he would be expelled for playing a leading role in the Arab uprising. But in today's arguments, prosecutor <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> said deportation proceedings began mainly because <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> violated immigration laws. Awad, born in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, spent 15 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen before returning to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1985. His attorney, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, said immigration laws did not apply to his client and other Arab residents of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> annexed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 Middle East War. Also today, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported the government charged two editors of the newspaper <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON> with being members of a terrorist organization and having contacts with foreign agents. <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Efrat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwartz </PERSON> were jailed pending trial and could face up to 40 years if convicted. The government said the two women were recruited to start the pro-Palestinian newspaper by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction. The radio said four other journalists for the Hebrew-language paper also were jailed but but not yet charged. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, elementary school girls in gray-striped uniforms and boys in street clothes could be seen trudging the roads to schools. The army said high schools in the territories will open next week if the relative calm persists. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported some classes would resume today at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a key site of protests when the Arab uprising began on Dec. 8. More than 190 Arabs have been killed since the uprising started. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and an Israeli settler also were killed. The Israeli army shut nearly 1,200 schools in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Feb. 2, at the height of unrest, keeping about 475,000 Palestinian children and teen-agers away from their classrooms. On Sunday, city officials reopened 31 public schools in Israeli-annexed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Up to 70 percent of 16,000 students attended classes, which proceeded without disruption, said <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheshin </PERSON>, the city's adviser on Arab Affairs. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurie </PERSON>, director of a private college in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, said he knew of many teachers who gave private lessons for students during the long closure. He noted that leaflets put out by underground leaders of the uprising urged students to return to school. `` They think it is one of the aims of the ` intefadeh' -LRB- uprising -RRB- _ to be educated,'' he said. On Sunday, a Palestinian mother and son died when their car caught fire from a firebomb near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, military and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said. The bombing occurred as <PERSON> Shamshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadah </PERSON>, 65, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, 36, drove home after leaving <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>'s wife at <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where she later gave birth to a girl, hospital officials said. Israeli military sources and <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Shuweika </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> said the firebomb was apparently thrown by Arabs aiming at an Israeli army jeep. Also Sunday, <PERSON> Kawther </PERSON> <PERSON> Miri </PERSON>, 23, died of a bullet wound suffered during a weekend clash with troops at a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, hospital officials said.

 Bombs blew up two cars owned by Turkish diplomats early today, just hours before the arrival of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s foreign minister A left-wing terrorist group claimed responsibility. No injuries were reported in the bombings in downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. A few hours after the explosions, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> arrived for talks on disputes that last year brought the two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies close to war. <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> was greeted at the airport by his Greek counterpart, <PERSON> Carolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON>. They went to a seaside hotel where discussions will take place through Thursday. Asked whether the bomb attacks would affect the atmosphere for the talks, <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> said: `` I do n't see how they can affect it.'' The left-wing November 17 group, which has taken responsibility for more than a dozen political killings in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, claimed responsibility for the bombings in a statement sent to the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> daily Ethnos. Security police said the claim appeared genuine. The five-page typewritten statement was published in today's edition of the left-wing newspaper, saying the group had targeted `` the fascist Turkish regime which has occupied <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> territory by force for the past 14 years. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government condemned the attacks, which damaged two cars belonging to Turkish Embassy administrative officials. `` The government expresses abhorrence for these criminal bomb attacks and condemns most categorically every form of terrorism, whatever its origin,'' a government statement said. Bombs exploded at 2:20 a.m. and 2:25 a.m. beneath cars parked 300 yards apart in a downtown residential area. Greek bomb disposal experts defused other devices left beneath two other cars parked near the Turkish Embassy building on <LOCATION> Vassileos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgiou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> close to the city center, said the security police spokesman who requested anonymity in accordance with Greek practice. All the cars carried green diplomatic license plates. <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>'s visit is seen as a test run for a scheduled June 13-15 trip to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> by Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, the first by a Turkish premier to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in more than 30 years. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> came to the brink of war in March 1987 over oil drilling rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The talks are being held under tight security following anti-Turkish threats by Cypriots, Kurdish political refugees and Greeks who formerly lived in the Turkish city of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>. The Cypriots are protesting the continuing presence of an estimated 30,000 Turkish troops in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island in 1974 following an Athens-inspired coup. Since then, the island has been split into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sectors. November 17 previously has targeted <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomats and leading Greek businessmen. The group is named for the day in 1973 that troops crushed a student rebellion against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.

<TEXT>
 First, the incumbent questioned his challenger's religious convictions and branded him a carpetbagger. Then the Democratic primary race in the 1st Congressional District really got nasty. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Call </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> publication that calls itself `` the newspaper of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the contest `` is turning into the nastiest primary in the country.'' Rep. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who seeks to deny the incumbent the nomination for an eighth term in Tuesday's election, have traded charges of incompetence and unethical conduct. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> has been accused of improperly directing a congressional investigation into a bank loan received by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. In turn, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> has slammed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as a carpetbagger, accusing him of moving back to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> for the sole purpose of seeking political office. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> also has been haunted by a legal entanglement 14 years ago. There are no statewide races on the primary ballot, and only one other congressional race has drawn any interest. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON> is running hard against former television reporter <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutter </PERSON> in the 3rd District in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. Three Republicans are running for the 3rd District nomination. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s race against <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> is the incumbent's first tough challenge since he won the seat in 1974 by upsetting Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubblefield </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, 50, has a well-financed campaign and is advertising extensively in the mostly rural district. One often-repeated jingle on <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> commercials advises <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to `` Pack up your troubles in your carpetbag and move, <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>, move.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 48, moved to <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION> in August from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> but has <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> ties. He was a state senator from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> in the early 1970s. And he has said that he and his wife have more than 200 relatives living in the district. In 1974, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was tried on a charge of obtaining money under false pretenses for allegedly soliciting a bribe from an insurance agency while he was on the staff of the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> mayor. He was acquitted, and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the charge was brought by an overzealous Republican prosecutor seeking re-election. As for <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, a complaint was filed with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> alleging that he improperly ordered an investigation of a $ 2.5 million loan <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> received from a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bank. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> investigated the loan at the request of a banking subcommittee that <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> chairs but found no wrongdoing. A <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official said the agency would not have investigated if it had known <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a candidate. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has charged that <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> is an incompetent lawmaker who misses important votes and has never passed any significant legislation. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> counters that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s only goal is election to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from a district he does not know. The <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> Courier-Journal, the state's largest newspaper, reluctantly endorsed <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, saying: `` They've spent a lot of time and money accusing each other of incompetence and sleaze. What's so depressing is that, when you examine the candidates, the kinds of charges we've heard seem believable.'' In a letter to supporters before <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> formally announced his candidacy, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> sent along copies of church bulletins, voter registration records and corporate publicity releases showing that <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was baptized in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Baptist church on Aug. 30, four days after he registered to vote in the 1st District. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> later transferred his membership to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has become a Baptist since he's come to our area,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said in the letter. `` But I find it ironic that he joined the -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> church -RRB- four days after he registered to vote in <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s father was a well-known Southern Baptist preacher in the area for many years. Though no reliable polls indicate how the race is going, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said he has been the victim of a `` vicious, vitriolic, venomous'' campaign conducted by `` a desperate man trying to do something to reverse the tide here in the last week.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who recently sold his interest in a <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION> engineering firm, said <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> has been a `` pen pal congressman'' interested only in his own self-preservation. `` If it's taken a nasty turn, it has n't been because of anything that I've done,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` People say that's negative because his record's negative.''

 GOP national officials will try to mediate a dispute that could result in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> showing up at the presidential nominating convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> with competing delegations. At the state Republican convention over the weekend, two slates were elected _ one after party regulars stormed out of the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, general counsel for the national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials would hear from both sides in the dispute. The case first would go before the party's nine-member contest committee, which would report its findings to the credentials committee, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. A ruling by the 106-member credentials committee could be appealed to the national convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> this summer, he added. Party regulars elected <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, state chairman for the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, to head the state's 48-member delegation to this summer's convention, but not until after they had angrily left the civic center Saturday. About 900 dissidents remained at the civic center afterward and elected a slate headed by <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, state chairman for <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s failed presidential campaign. All 48 delegates are required to vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the convention, since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won every county in the state during <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s March 8 presidential primary. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> captured only 13 percent of the state vote, but his backers, many of whom are party newcomers, organized in an effort to influence the party platform and the selection of a vice presidential nominee. The turmoil this weekend stemmed from efforts by state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> and other party regulars to deny Robertson-dominated county delegations a chance to participate in the state convention. `` This will probably wind up in an awful mess,'' said national committeeman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillis </PERSON>. `` All he -LRB- <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> -RRB- had to do was let these folks be seated.''

 A power surge or short circuit at a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> switching station in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> plus workers' failure to notice an alarm light knocked out phone service for up to 400,000 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinians </LOCATION>, officials say. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucom </PERSON> said Sunday a battery-powered system took over after the power failure, but when no one noticed the alarm, the batteries ran down and service was disrupted. `` We missed it,'' he said. `` Ideally, if we had caught the alarms when we should have, it would have been fixed.'' Henceforth, additional workers will be posted at the switching station's alarm area to monitor it round-the-clock seven days a week, <PERSON> Baucom </PERSON> said. Saturday's nine-hour scattered telephone failures affected customers from <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> in the western mountains to just west of <LOCATION> Rockingham </LOCATION>, about 180 miles away, frustrating callers and wreaking havoc with airline and retail computer systems. Calls to 911 were silenced as well, leading police in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, the state's largest city, to post officers at fire departments and major intersections where people who might need help could get them. Most officers worked double shifts Saturday, said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mecklenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any horror stories to come out of it so far,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said Sunday after service had been restored. The police spokesman said he knew of no crimes, fires or accidents going unanswered because of the telephone troubles. `` In fact, not too long after 911 came back, we got -LRB- a report of -RRB- an armed robbery in progress and were able to stop it,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Other phone customers were not so lucky. `` It's going to affect us massively,'' said <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Mane </PERSON>, training manager at <PERSON> Ivey </PERSON>'s department store in <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION>. `` We're requiring credit approval on all credit purchases and we're really going to have a problem closing tonight because we ca n't transfer out data,'' she said Saturday evening. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddins </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, said automated teller machines in the affected areas could not operate without long-distance phone lines to connect computer data bases. The situation also caused confusion at <LOCATION> Charlotte-Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where arriving passengers could not call relatives or friends or even a taxicab to pick them up, said J.F. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> of the airport's security force. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said airline reservation clerks were forced to process by hand tickets normally printed and filed by computer.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up California Case Involving Court Jurisdiction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether two <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service workers involved in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> traffic accidents while delivering mail must face criminal charges in state court. The justices said they will hear a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration attempt to transfer the prosecutions to federal court. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year that state courts have authority in the cases, which stem from accidents in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. In one, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON> was accused of misdemeanor manslaughter after her mail truck collided with and killed a bicyclist. In the other, <PERSON> Shabbir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON> was charged with speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided with a police car. Both defendants initially succeeded in having their cases transferred to a federal court but the 9th Circuit court sent the prosecutions back to state courts. The appeals court rejected arguments that the cases should be handled in federal court to prevent possible bias against the mail carriers. `` The attentuated federal interest in ensuring that their trial be unbiased does not justify an invasion of the state's authority to police its streets,'' the appeals court said. `` There is simply no reason to believe that, on a systematic basis, postal workers will not get a fair shake in state court.'' The appeals court added that overburdened federal courts `` do not need a new category of pesky cases turning solely on state law.'' In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the appeals court ruling violates a federal law aimed at protecting federal officials in the performance of their official duties. The appeals court decision would `` permit states ... to undermine federal policies and programs,'' the appeal said, adding that it `` presents a potential threat to federal -LRB- legal -RRB- supremacy anywhere federal policies encounter local hostility.'' The 9th Circuit court noted that the federal law providing for removal of such cases to federal court was enacted in response to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s opposition to a trade embargo declared during the War of 1812 between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Federal customs officials were given authority then to board vessels in order to collect duties, assuring they would avoid prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the performance of their duties. The appeals court said there is no claim by the two mail carriers that their allegedly illegal conduct was justified by the duties they were performing. `` There is no effort on the state's part to criminalize activity important to federal interests, as there was during the War of 1812,'' the appeals court said. The case is <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 87-1206.

<HEAD>Libel Award Against Virginia Newspaper Left Intact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today let stand a $ 100,000 libel award won against a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, newspaper and one of its reporters by a high school teacher in that city. The justices, without comment, refused to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge of the judgment won by <PERSON> Vernelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, a longtime English teacher in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s public schools. Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, then head of the English department at <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, sued over an Aug. 16, 1981, article that ran atop the newspaper's front page. In it, students and their parents were quoted as calling Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> `` disorganized, erratic, forgetful and unfair,'' and charging that she `` demeans and humiliates students.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> was quoted as saying she had been advised by her lawyer not to talk about the complaints. A state court jury, finding that the article included libelous statements made with `` actual malice,'' awarded Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> $ 1 million in compensatory damages from the newspaper and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, the reporter who wrote the article. The jury also ordered <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 45,000 in punitive damages. The presiding judge later reduced the compensatory-damages award to $ 100,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last Oct. 30 ruled that the trial judge erred in considering Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> a public official rather than a private citizen for purposes of the libel suit. Public officials who sue for libel must prove the sued-over statement was false and was made with actual malice _ either knowledge of or reckless disregard of its falsity. Private citizens who sue for libel have an easier burden of proof _ that the statement was false and was made negligently. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, because it ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> is not a public figure, ordered the punitive-damages award against <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> dropped. But the state court upheld the $ 100,000 judgment, ruling that there was sufficient evidence of negligence. In the appeal acted on today, the newspaper's lawyers argued that Ms. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> should have been considered a public official who could not win her libel suit unless she proved actual malice. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, 87-1636.

 Six men convicted as members of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and one of their associates lost <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeals today. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the rights of crime syndicate boss <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> and six others were not violated in the government's racketeering prosecution. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the seven convictions last October, rejecting numerous arguments. The defendands said, for example, they were subjected to double jeopardy and that the jurors should have been sequestered during an eight-month trial. <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> was sentenced to 39 years in prison on racketeering conspiracy charges, for conspiring to extort money from concrete construction firms, for paying a gratuity to a federal prison official and for offering a $ 20,000 bribe to a federal official to transfer him to a different prison. <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> also has been convicted in a separate racketeering trial with heads of other crime families and sentenced to 100 years in prison. His eldest son, <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeRoss </PERSON>, described by the government as an underworld captain, each were sentenced to 12 years in prison. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, each a reputed captain in the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> family, were sentenced to 35 years and 14 years, respectively. <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> Cataldo </PERSON>, described as a soldier in the family, was sentenced to 14 years. And <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime family associate, received a 10-year sentence to run consecutively to a nine-year term he already was serving on a bribery conviction. Prosecutors said the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> family was involved in a wide range of criminal activity _ including loansharking, narcotics trafficking, extortion, labor racketeering, theft and bribery. The cases are <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1314; <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1323; <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeRoss </PERSON> and Scarpati vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1324; <PERSON> Cataldo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1553; and <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-6597.

<HEAD>Iranian Ships Sighted In Strait of Hormuz</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A large Iranian warship, two frigates and a landing craft sailed in coastal waters in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> today, shipping executives reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it was conducting naval manuevers in the area. The executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the vessels could not be identified as to type or number. But it appeared that one, described as `` very large,'' could be a destroyer. None of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s three destroyers has been active in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for more than a year. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced Sunday that it was carrying out naval exercises in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, and that the 50 ships participating included `` missile carrying destroyers, destroyers, missile launching frigates and personnel carriers.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today that Iranian armed forces staged amphibious maneuvers in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> to demonstrate that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has not crippled its naval forces. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the maneuvers involved `` various land, sea and air operations'' and included electronic jamming of radar and radio communications, aircraft detection, paratroop drops and air raid interceptions. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified naval intelligence officer as saying the exercises were aimed at `` disproving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that it had crippled half the hardware of the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'' in clashes on April 18. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not claimed to have cut <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy by half, but said its warships and combat jets sank or crippled six Iranian vessels in the daylong fighting. These included the 1,540-ton, British-built frigate Sahand, a fast attack patrol boat and two armed speedboats sunk, the frigate Sabalan disabled and a speedboat probably sunk. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said more than 40 of its men were killed and several vessels, including the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION>, were damaged by missiles and bombs. The only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties were two <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> pilots killed when their AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, possibly to Iranian fire. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has since broadened the role of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf, enabling them to intervene in attacks by Iranian gunboats on neutral shipping under any non-belligerent flag and in international waters. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships, an authoritative naval reference, says <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s forces include three destroyers: the Damavand, a 3,360-ton destroyer built for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 and two former American warships launched in 1944, the 3,320-ton destroyers Babr and Palang. All of these vessels, sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the late 1960s and early 1970s, were fitted with surface-to-surface and anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons, but none have been reported operating in at least the past year.

<HEAD>Court Says Fixed Annuities Fall Under Securities Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case the insurance industry was watching closely, today let stand a ruling that millions of so-called fixed annuities are subject to federal securities law. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that fixed annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the same as stocks and bonds. Fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as insurance contracts because investors never risk their principal. Annuity holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus a certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals. In 1985, 10 million individual annuities representing $ 24 billion in present and deferred annual payments were outstanding, according to insurance industry sources. Some 33 million Americans were covered under private pension plans funded by group annuity contracts that received $ 35 billion in contributions during that year and paid out $ 10 billion in benefits. There also existed seven million `` universal life'' policies _ a form of annuities _ representing $ 564 billion of insurance in 1985. Holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of return on contributions. And most annuity plans provide for `` excess interest'' paid at the discretion of the annuity company. In 1967, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that so-called variable annuities, those that do not assure any minimum interest payments on contributions, may be treated as securities regulated by federal law. But a ruling by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April 15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was treated as a security. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> sued the <ORGANIZATION> Variable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annuity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in 1982, charging the Texas-based stock insurance company with failing to disclose the method it used to calculate excess-interest payments. Her `` class action'' lawsuit was filed in behalf of all <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> residents who invested in <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION>'s fixed annuity program between Oct. 17, 1975 and Aug. 2, 1982. The suit contended that the fixed annuity is a `` security,'' and that <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> had violated anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law. A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that the fixed annuity is not a security. But the 7th Circuit court reversed that ruling, reinstating the suit. The appeals court relied, in part, on a 1986 rule issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> providing certain annuities with a `` safe harbor'' exclusion from federal securities law. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION>'s fixed annuity did not qualify for such treatment because its excess-interest rate on existing deposits could be changed at any time at <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION>'s discretion. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> said, `` The court's ruling will unquestionably increase insurance companies' costs of doing business, which will make annuities more expensive for consumers and limit the availability of these policies.'' The appeal was supported in `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> vs. Otto, 87-600.

<TEXT>
 Former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> violated that country's laws by allowing investigators to examine his bank accounts. The court announced Saturday that it had ordered <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> to open the records to <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> investigators, despite objections raised by the bank. The Philippine government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had asked <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for help in locating an estimated $ 1 billion <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly deposited in Swiss banks. According to a statement released Sunday night by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> authorities told the Aquino government last year that, under <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> law, criminal charges would have to be filed against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> before his bank accounts could be investigated. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recently certified that no criminal charges have been filed against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in any <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> court, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` The news that the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Count </ORGANIZATION> announced that it has authorized a bank to allow investigators to examine bank account records is definitely contrary to Swiss laws governing bank deposits,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation. The court, in a 6-2 ruling, said a worker injured falling from a scaffold at a nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is entitled to seek a `` bonus'' compensation award. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said federal law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety regulations at federal facilities by awarding supplemental workers' compensation for code violations `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' reluctance to allow direct state regulation of federal projects -LRB- does not bar -RRB- incidental regulatory effects arising from the enforcement of a workers' compensation law, like <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s, that provides an additional award when the injury is caused by the breach of a safety regulation,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The court ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The federally owned plant enriches and refines nuclear fuel used for civililan energy and for weapons and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> submarines and ships. <PERSON> Esto </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a mechanic, was injured on July 30, 1980, when his glove caught on a bolt protruding from the mobile scaffold on which he was working. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was pulled from the platform and broke his ankle falling to the ground some six feet below. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was awarded $ 9,000 in workmen's compensation. He sought an additional award of between $ 1,328 and $ 4,429 fgrom <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> because, he said, the scaffold was defective and violated <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> safety regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986 that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is entitled to seek the additional compensation. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion written by <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend to expose federal facilities to such state regulation.

<TEXT>
 Two senators and an 11-member coalition of health groups called today for increased spending on disorders that afflict senior citizens, saying the money will be needed to cope with `` the largest senior boom in history.'' The Task Force for Aging Research Funding recommended that the nation spend $ 340 million above current levels on research into strokes, Alzheimer's disease and other afflictions. The figure is $ 278 million higher than what President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has requested for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. `` We wo n't be able to accomplish this budget, but we ought to push for it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's very practical. It's an absolute must when you look at the demographics and the cost'' of health care. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION>, said senior citizens groups are leading the push for the additional spending, but `` it's for the benefit of those to follow'' since the research wo n't bear fruit for 10 to 20 years <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, executive director of the nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said one-third of the $ 450 billion spent annually on health care is on the 12 percent of the population over 65. With no medical breakthroughs, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said, by the middle of the next century there will be three times more hip fractures, four times as much demand for nursing home beds and eight times as many cases of dementia as in 1980. `` Our goal is not simply a longer life span but a longer health-span,'' he said. In its report, the task force says less than 0.5 percent of the $ 146 billion spent annually on health care for those over 65 goes for research to prevent and treat age-related problems. `` This represents a poor investment strategy for a nation soon to experience the largest senior boom in history,'' the report said. The number of Americans over 85, currently 2.7 million, is expected to double by the end of the century and quadruple in the next 60 years, the task force said. `` We can tinker with changes in the health care delivery system which can produce some savings ... but these savings will not equal the long-term benefits of dramatic medical and scientific changes that will alter the way we experience old age,'' the report said. The task force called for a national focus on research to help lower medical expenses and improve the health of older Americans, including higher investments in basic research and research targeted at specific diseases such as Alzheimer's; faster clinical trials; greater support and training for geriatric medicine; and further study of the psychological, behavioral and sociological aspects of aging. The agencies receiving budget increases under the task force proposal would be the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communicative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> and Stroke; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthritis </ORGANIZATION> and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases; and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Members of the task force are the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>; the Alzheimer's Disease and <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disorders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geriatrics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in Immunology and Aging; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in Neurological and Communicative Disorders; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osteoporosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>; and Paralyzed Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> today announced his candidacy for a third term in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, saying the welfare of young Americans and fighting drugs will be among his chief concerns. `` The issue of drugs is a tormenting one in this country now. I have been, and will continue to be seized with the issue of drug abuse,'' the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat said after announcing his candidacy outside a Syracuse office building. He also said long-term health care for the elderly and rebuilding the nation's transportation system would be among the top concerns of a third term. The senator called it `` a personal tragedy and a national shame that we require millions of seniors to become paupers before their medical costs are covered.'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, 61, was scheduled to repeat his announcement this afternoon at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Center of Mathematics and Science and attend a fund-raising rally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider overturning the adoption by a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> couple of Choctaw Indian twins. The justices said they will hear arguments by tribal leaders that state courts lacked the authority to grant the adoption. The children, a boy and a girl, were born Dec. 29, 1985, in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, near the Choctaw reservation. Their mother, <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, and their father, <PERSON> Windell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choctaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>.

A <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> judge, noting that Ms. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had traveled off the reservation to give birth, said the <LOCATION> Choctaw </LOCATION> tribe therefore `` never obtained exclusive jurisdiction over the children.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the adoption. Choctaw leaders said the ruling unlawfully violates the tribe's sovereignty over its own legal affairs They also said the decision could encourage illegal adoption of Choctaw babies by making <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> `` a potential adoption <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> for, among others, black marketeers trading in Indian children.'' The case is In the Matter of B.B. and G.B. vs. <LOCATION> Holyfield </LOCATION>, 87-980.

 Residents of this town pledged today to whittle their waistlines and cut cholesterol as part of a two-year, $ 4 million study aimed at reducing heart disease among rural Americans. `` This town is looking healthier already,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipriani </PERSON> during a ceremony marking the start of the fitness study. `` I predict that in two years we will be living longer, healthier lives.'' After <PERSON> Cipriani </PERSON>'s remarks, residents released thousands of red, white and blue heart-shaped balloons into threatening skies. A card signed by residents who promised to adopt a healthier lifestyle was attached to each balloon. `` I hope to quit smoking, I've been trying for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 40, one of those attending the ceremony. `` Our eating habits are really bad, too, too much junk food and meat and eggs.'' The program, one of the first privately funded public health education programs for rural areas, is sponsored by The <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Glenbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, the aspirin maker's New York-based parent. Signs of a fitness frenzy are evident throughout the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town.

 Authorities continued their search today for an armed escapee who took two guards hostage in a prison Jeep before leaving them at a hotel and fleeing with his wife and a child in a getaway car, officials said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, escaped Sunday night from the medium-security <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON>. `` At this point we have an all-points bulletin out throughout <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and in surrounding states,'' <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said early today. <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said Day has relatives in the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> area and his wife has relatives in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Day was serving a sentence of 18-to-55 years in the prison, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, for burglary and other felonies. He was believed to be armed with a .25 - caliber weapon, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of the State Highway <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said Day took the guards hostage shortly after 7 p.m. with a gun apparently smuggled into the prison, <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said. `` That's how he got through the prison security,'' <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said. A .38 - caliber revolver that was kept in the Jeep was discarded near the prison after the escape, <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> A shotgun also kept in the vehicle was recovered. Day took the guards, whose names were not released, to the Holiday Inn near downtown, <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said. Day handcuffed one guard to the Jeep steering wheel and took the other into a room registered in the name of Day's 27-year-old wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caraveo </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON>. Day told the guard to handcuff himself to a towel bar. <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said that guard freed himself after <PERSON> Day </PERSON> and his wife left the hotel. The guard went to the window and saw the two get into a car. The couple, who <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said married while Day was in prison, had a 9-year-old child with them, but officials were n't sure if the child was related to the fugitives. <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said authorities were acting on the assumption the child was Mrs. Day's daughter. Authorities found the getaway car behind a restaurant near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 23 and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 35 on the city's east side, <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said. The highway patrol said Mrs. Day had checked in at the hotel Saturday. Day was convicted of attempted abduction, burglary, receiving stolen property and carrying a concealed weapon, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a prison spokeswoman. He had been at the <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> prison since June and had served at the <ORGANIZATION> Chillicothe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> since April 1985.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Consider Reinstating Massachusetts
Child-Pornography Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> child-pornography law a state court said could be used to prosecute parents who photograph their naked, infant children on the beach. The justices voted to review a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, reached by a 4-3 vote, that the state law too broadly interferes with a form of expression. The state court ruling overturned the criminal conviction in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> for `` soliciting a child to pose for pornographic purposes.'' Prosecutors said <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> in 1984 induced his 14-year-old stepdaughter to pose for photographs while clothed only in bikini underpants and with a scarf draped around her neck. Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered the photographs. When <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> appealed, the state's highest court threw out his conviction and dismissed the criminal indictment. The state court's 4-3 majority said photography is a form of expression with which the state may interfere only when the interference serves an important governmental purpose and is narrowly drawn to serve that purpose. Looking at the state law involved, the state court said, `` The overbreadth is substantial. It criminalizes conduct that virtually every person would regard as lawful.'' `` For example,'' the state court added, `` -LRB- the law -RRB- makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.'' The state court's three dissenters said taking photographs is not a form of expression and the `` narrowly drawn'' test traditionally used in free-speech cases should not have been used. In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said a 1982 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision excluding child pornography from free-speech protections `` established that states are entitled to greater leeway in the regulation of pornographic depictions of children than might be appropriate in other contexts.'' The case is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 87-1651.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave trial judges broad power to deny criminal defendants the lawyer of their choice if a possible conflict of interest exists. The court also ruled that judges may veto a defendant's choice of lawyers even when the defendant is willing to waive the right to conflict-free legal help. By a 5-4 vote, the justices upheld the 1984 narcotics-trafficking conspiracy conviction of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, who received and stored large shipments of Mexican marijuana at his <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home and then distributed the illegal drug to local customers. Wheat, one of 23 people charged in the conspiracy, had challenged the conviction on grounds that he wrongly was denied the defense lawyer of his choice. Wheat had sought to have lawyer <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> join another attorney in representing him. But the presiding judge rejected Wheat's request because <PERSON> Iredale </PERSON> already represented two other accused conspirators who possibly would have been called to testify against Wheat. Wheat had argued that the mere possibility of a conflict of interest for a defense lawyer can not suffice to veto a defendant's choice of lawyers, especially when the defendant is willing to waive any right to conflict-free representation But writing for the court today, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said a defendant's waiver can not cure the problems caused by one lawyer representing more than one defendant in the samg he inter-4v interest in the rendition of just verdicts in criminal cases may be jeopardized by unregulated multiple representation,'' he said. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said trial judges `` must recognize a presumption in favor of a -LRB- defendant's -RRB- counsel of choice'' but he said that presumption `` may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was joined by Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voted to overturn Wheat's conviction. Writing for himself and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said, `` I believe that the potential for a conflict of interest in this case did not overcome -LRB- Wheat's -RRB- right to choose his own counsel.'' Writing for himself and <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said Wheat should have been allowed `` additional counsel of his choice'' because he still would have had legal representation if an actual conflict developed. `` In this case, it is abundantly clear to me that the district judge abused his discretion and deprived -LRB- Wheat -RRB- of a constitutional right of such fundamental character that reversal is required,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to consider reinstating a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> child-pornography law a state court said could be used to prosecute parents who photograph their naked, infant children on the beach. The justices voted to review a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, reached by a 4-3 vote, that the state law too broadly interferes with a form of expression. _ Gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal nuclear producti on facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation. The court, in a 6-2 ruling, said a worker injured falling from a scaffold at a nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is entitled to seek a `` bonus'' compensation award. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said federal law does not prohibit states from indirectly enforcing safety regulations at federal fcilities by awarding supplemental workers' compensation for code violations _ Let stand a ruling that millions of so-called fixed annuities are subject to federal securities law. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that fixed annuities paying fluctuating interest rates may be regulated the same as stocks and bonds. _ Let stand a $ 100,000 libel award won against a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, newspaper and one of its reporters by a high school teacher in that city. The justices, without comment, refused to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>'s challenge of the judgment won by <PERSON> Vernelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, a longtime English teacher in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s public schools. _ Refused to unravel a merger between <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> that created the nation's largest wholesale photofinishing operation. The court, without comment, rejected a competitor's arguments that the deal violates antitrust laws. _ Turned away an appeal by six men convicted as members of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and one of their associates. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that the rights of crime syndicate boss <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Persico </PERSON> and six others were not violated in the government's racketeering prosecution. _ Agreed to consider overturning the adoption by a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> couple of Choctaw Indian twins. The justices said they will hear arguments by tribal leaders that state courts lacked the authority to grant the adoption. The counsel case is Wheat vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-4.

 A four-term congressman announced today that he will seek the Republican nomination for governor, setting the stage for a race in which the stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear plant is likely to figure prominently. Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he would bring to the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> a record of `` fiscal restraint and common sense, a record of commitment to low taxation and an understanding of the basic values of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> also is seeking the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> announced a week ago he will not seek a fourth two-year term. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, a 41-year-old lawyer, said he favors allowing <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> to go into operation provided it meets certain conditions, including having a `` safe, workable evacuation plan.'' He also said the plant's cost should be shared by consumers, investors and debtholders. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 53, today called <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> `` a monumental disaster,'' and said he will fight to have it converted to natural gas. `` Already, that incredibly expensive and politically mismanaged project has bankrupted the state's largest utility.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sent an emissary back to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for more talks aimed at the removal from power of ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and the administration wants the issue cleared up before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, an official said today. `` It would be desirable to clear it up while the president's on our own soil,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, undersecretary of state. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a stopover in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, before arriving in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday. The president, at a ceremony in the Rose Garden dealing with world trade, was asked if there would be an agreement with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before Wednesday. `` We're not going by time; we're going by quality,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. hp ~ = \ @ @ O = ~ _ ^ 4 | _ greater than __ @ __ ^ rafficking indictments against It's still in the works.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy assistant secretary, returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after briefing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top officials over the weekend on negotiations for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> had spent virtually all of May in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> trying to work out an agreement. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> `` was n't going down with an ultimatum'' and that it was uncertain whether the negotiations would be resolved before the summit. `` <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> is back down there and I do n't expect that the president's going to want to spend his time in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talking to Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> said. He said negotiations with the Panamanian leader were proceeding. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s latest trip comes amid uncertainty about the administration's strategy in dealing with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the national security adviser, said Sunday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was undecided on approval of a deal for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has put the plan `` on the table.'' The proposal calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue recognizing ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate leader rather than <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s handpicked choice and the current president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' also denied reports that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had agreed to recognize <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as part of the deal for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down `` No, I do n't know where you get that understanding. There's nothing to that,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said The secretary also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has had a lot of discussions'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` but we have n't concluded any agreement.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who attended a 2 -LCB- - hour session at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other senior advisers, said U.S.-Panamanian negotiations are `` on hold,'' but the administration has proposed a deal `` It's on the table. All the elements have not yet come together, the president has not yet made a decision,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` The president has agreed for the deal to be put on the table, but it has not gone to closure,'' he said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not yet decided on the deal because `` dropping an indictment of this nature is a very serious matter.'' An administration official, who requested anonymity, said Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for nine months starting this August and for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to drop drug smuggling indictments against him. The official said the deal would give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a role in setting up a transition government before leaving, and also would allow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for holidays and to go back permanently after elections set for May 1989. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the plan, which has not changed significantly in recent weeks, calls for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down from power as commander of the Panamanian defense forces and allow free elections in May 1989. `` Over the last several months, we have been able to put together a deal if you would, a set of negotiations, which would require General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down from power. He would then leave the country for a period of time,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> steps down, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would continue to recognize President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> would work _ we would hope _ with President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and other opposition leaders to form a government of national reconciliation,'' he said. The national security adviser said the deal's elements `` that are on the table would remove him from the political process and he would not be a candidate for election in 1989.'' Both <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> defended the proposed deal, saying that dropping the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a defensible bargaining position because he can not be extradited so long as he remains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The indictments that were handed down are indictments that would be very difficult to follow up on,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` We have no ability to extradite him from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` So you ask yourself which situation are we better off in _ to have <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> more or less in charge in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and us with an indictment that we ca n't do much about but nevertheless holding on to it, or having <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> give up power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and leaving <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but also having paid that penalty?''

<HEAD>Justices Broaden Study of Claimed Deductions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today expanded its study of whether payments made to the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION> by its members may be claimed as federal income tax deductions. The justices, who last month agreed to review the issue, today added one case to its study _ the test case used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision is expected sometime next year. Scientologists make payments called `` fixed donations'' to the church. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says such payments for `` auditing'' and training sessions are not charitable contributions that can be counted as tax deductions. Scientologists say the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has singled out their church for unfair treatment and is interfering with their religious freedom. Federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by declaring various deductions, including money or things of value given to charities or religious organizations. But such a payment is not tax-deductible if something of value is received in return. A practice within the Church of Scientology is a process known as auditing, in which members are expected to reach a higher level of spiritual awareness. Auditing is administered in a one-to-one session in which the church member's skin responses to questions are measured by an electronic device. Each branch of the church charges a `` fixed donation'' for training and auditing sessions, and almost never waives the payment requirement.

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 lay crippled near a <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> hangar today after beif the boggy field where it slid ng dragged out onose-down during an aborted takeoff. Workers took several hours to haul the huge jet from the mud where it had been stuck since Saturday. `` It's a slow, tedious process,'' another airline spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he expects the rules will end the `` reign of reruns'' on TV, and, by giving broadcasters a measure of protection, will heighten the value of the programs to advertisers. More ad revenue, in turn, will foster production of new programs, he said. `` The big winners today are consumers. They will benefit by a smooth transition to a fairer and more competitive market structure which promises richer and more diverse programming,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. It is unlikely cable systems will have ort-term political advantage, which I can not believe they will do,'' he said. Broadcasters have been pushing the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to reimpose exclusivity rules and were happy with the final product, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the action `` pulled the plug on the favorite TV programs of millions of people.'' <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> predicted that `` people whose favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered,'' and the costs of syndicated programming will go up. The rules are similar to ones the FCC dropped in 1980. Since then, cable systems have been able to carry the signals of out-of-town stations such as <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WWOR </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and <ORGANIZATION> WGN </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which have become known as superstations, even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought by a local TV station. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> WTBS </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement the new rules `` do not give the cable industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> held out the possibility of a court appeal, but said that decision would be made after the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> issues its written rules. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeman </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, Okla.-based cable carrier that distributes superstation signals, including <ORGANIZATION> WGN </ORGANIZATION>, said cable systems in some large markets, where independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming, may have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of a superstation's programming. `` That's enough for the cable operator to drop the signal,'' he said. Under the new syndicated programming exclusivity rules, TV stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to honor that contract. The rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate rights with cable systems. Superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for syndicated shows on a nationwide basis, under the rules. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said the new rules wo n't go into effect for one year, to give cable systems time to prepare. The rules wo n't apply to cable systems with fewer than 1,000 subscribers. About half of all cable systems fall into this category, though they serve only about 5 percent of the nation's 45 million cable subscribers, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` You will see more diversity in programs,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, though he added that rules will likely drive up the cost of syndicated programming.

<HEAD>Congress' Sudden Hot Issue: Home Health Care for Everyone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Public concern over the cost of longterm illnesses has become the driving force behind Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>'s determined campaign to force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote on his plan to expand <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> _ and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> taxes _ to cover the expenses of home health care With polls claiming enormous support for a government program to address those concerns, longterm-care proposals are proliferating on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` This issue is one that voters will carry into the ballot box,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of 100 organizations with affiliates in 35 states. `` Virtually every family stands at risk of needing longterm home care at any time, and none of us are protected very well against that eventuality,'' Fried said. `` It cuts across age lines, it cuts across economic lines, it cuts across whether people view themselves as liberals or conservatives. This is what the population wants.'' Pepper's five-year, $ 30 billion proposal would expand <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> to pay for various home care services for the chronically ill of all ages. It would be financed by subjecting all income to the 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax; currently only income up to $ 45,000 is taxed. No deductible or co-payment requirement would be imposed. Business interests are critical, partly because they would have to match the additional Medicare tax payments. And budget watchdogs predict the financing mechanism will prove inadequate, leading to higher deficits or costly premiums and co-payments. The plan advanced by Pepper, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., is encountering a lot of competition Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, has proposed what is likely to be the House Republican alternative: a $ 25 million, 30-month demonstration program in five geographically diverse sites. Medicare would pay 80 percent of home-care costs after a $ 500 deductible is met. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health, has offered a plan of his own. Medicare would pay up to $ 2,000 for respite care; 80 percent of the cost of home health care after a $ 500 deductible is met; and 70 percent of nursing home costs after a two-year exclusionary period. And Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., plans to introduce an $ 18.6 billion Medicare expansion called `` Lifecare. The program would pay for home care services and six months of nursing home care with no co-payments or deductibles, and 35 percent of subsequent nursing home care, minus the cost of room and board. But Pepper's bill is the only one heading for quick action, probably early next month, for several reasons: He is chairman of the powerful Rules Committee; at 87, the oldest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member, he is revered by senior citizens across the country as their advocate and he has campaigned for many of his colleagues. `` I'm trying to cooperate ... provided they do n't make us wait too long'' for a vote, <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> said last week. `` We're getting almost to the edge of our endurance.'' Initially, Pepper planned to offer his bill as an amendment to a catastrophic health plan designed to help the elderly deal with the heavy cost of acute illness. But <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders feared that tactic would sink the whole bill. Pepper withheld his proposal in return for Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s promise of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor vote on it Ordinarily, the bill would have gone to the Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> sped the bill out of his <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last November and has been waiting ever since. Ways and Means Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., doe n't hide his distaste for Pepper's bill He contends it is too expensive and technically flawed and should go through his committee for review. There is little doubt, given the political climate, that <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION>'s bill will win <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` We'll do the best we can as fast as we can. Maybe it'll be this year, maybe it'll be next year. We do n't have to have a deadline.'' Those who work closely with Pepper say it is a mistake to count him out this year. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, staff director of a health subcommittee chaired by Pepper, noted that half the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are up for re-election and longterm care is a staple on the campaign trail this year. She said a similar atmosphere existed two years ago when Pepper pushed through a bill outlawing mandatory retirement.

<TEXT>
 While the superpowers strive to put into force the treaty banning medium-range missiles, senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists have been getting together for confidential talks to discuss future arms control issues and ways to avoid nuclear war. Thetalks, taking place through two committees operating under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, have been described by American participants as surprisingly frank and productive. One group, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, known as CISAC, recently completed a three-day closed-door meeting with leading Soviet academicians headed by <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Chairing the 17-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> panel is <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> K.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Panofsky </PERSON>, former director of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Linear Accelerator Center. The latest meeting _ the 12th in a series of confidential sessions that CISAC has held with Soviet counterparts since 1981 _ took place May 4-6 at a conference center in <LOCATION> Queenstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The tone of the meeting was `` very constructive and very friendly,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbruner </PERSON>, a committee member and director of foreign policy studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. `` It's a very pragmatic, congenial working atmosphere.'' `` We discussed strategic force reduction, issues of verification and conventional force questions that have to do with the mainline items of arms control,'' he said. `` Our ground rules are that we do not, however, discuss directly the negotiations that are under way.'' <PERSON> Steinbruner </PERSON> said the main verification issue that came under discussion dealt with cruise missiles, which pose special problems because they are relatively small and easily concealed. He said that over the past seven years, `` there's no question but that we have seen in the course of these meetings very extensive development in the thinking of people on the Soviet side who are in touch with high-level officials in the leadership. ... It's pretty encouraging.'' Another CISAC member, <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said `` one not only gains insight into Soviet positions but also informs influential Soviet scientists about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> thinking on these issues.'' Other Americans currently serving on the committee include <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederberg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Townes </PERSON>, a physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science adviser <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. A second group operating under the sponsorship of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contributions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> to the Prevention of Nuclear War. This 20-member panel, formed in 1985, has been looking beyond the strategic and technical aspects of nuclear war to consider questions such as how superpower leaders interpret each other's actions and under what conditions they might resort to nuclear weapons <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, co-chairman of the committee and a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the group is starting to develop a joint U.S.-Soviet project involving public opinion research in the two countries. He said that during two working trips to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, he was impressed by the change of mood under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Among academicians, which is my immediate concern, it's just a tremendous uplift,'' <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> said. `` For some _ for example, sociologists whose field is public opinion research _ just a total liberation. They can come out of the bushes for the first time in their memories.'' Panel co-chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a Nobel laureate in economics at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he had been `` rather pleasurably surprised'' with the rapid pace at which the group has been able to develop contacts with Soviet social scientists. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he too was encouraged by the Soviet leadership's increasing sensitivity to sounding out and analyzing public attitudes on U.S.-Soviet relations and arms control `` The whole idea behind this committee is that a sane and informed world _ a world in which people understand better how they themselves and other people behave _ has a chance of being a little better world than a world in which we fly by the seat of our pants,'' he said.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, currying favor with <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is likely to balk if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asks him to back a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution barring arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war is expected to be on the agenda when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet May 29-June 2 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviets went along with a U.S.-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution in July 1987 urging <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to end the war, which began in September 1980. The Soviets and the Chinese, however, have refused to support a followup resolution to stop the flow of arms to the belligerents. `` The chances of passing that resolution peaked about February or early March,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be identified. Because <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wants to continue the war, and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> wants to end it, the second resolution `` would amount to a de facto embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the official said. Also, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> does not want to offend <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, particularly as Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> remain at loggerheads in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, the experts say. The Soviets and the Chinese are key because they are permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and could veto any resolution. The Chinese, who supply <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with close to half of its weapons, eased their opposition in February, increasing pressure on the Soviets, who are the major arms supplier to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But pressure on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> fell after the U.S.-Iranian naval battle on April 18, in which American ships killed 44 Iranians and knocked out half the opposing navy by disabling two Iranian frigates and sinking or damaging four speed boats. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action in the gulf pushed the Chinese and the Russians away from backing the resolution,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source. `` The Russians had always been reluctant on the second resolution, but this gave them something to hang their hat on.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rode to power in 1979 on a wave of indignation against <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, a long-time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, but the ayatollah paired his vehement condemnation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, `` the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Satan </LOCATION>,'' with anti-Soviet rhetoric that was nearly as strong. Soviet-Iranian relations improved somewhat following the disclosure in November 1986 that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration secretly had sold arms to the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> regime. And ties between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> further improved after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision last year to offer naval protection to 11 reflagged tankers belonging to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a non-belligerent ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the war. Lately, however, `` there has been nothing really terribly new'' in <LOCATION> Soviet-Iranian </LOCATION> ties, said <PERSON> Shireen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces a ticklish situation as he fulfills his promise to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which not only borders <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but shares much of its cultural, ethnic and linguistic heritage. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s cooperation is vital in repatriating 2.5 million Afghans who fled to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following the Soviet invasion in 1979. An additional 3.5 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> pose a similar problem. Iranian cooperation also would assist the Soviets in assuring `` that a neutral state is established in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>. `` The Russians do not want a pro-Western government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' Additionally, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has been backing several groups of anti-Soviet Afghan guerrillas who share his fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem faith. As the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pulls back from forward positions in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` the Iranians have the capability to make life difficult for the Soviets, at least in the outlying areas,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source. In at least one instance, the mujahedden guerrillas and the Soviets appear to have worked out a modus vivendi. `` The mujahedeen have been distributing leaflets in the area of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> -LRB- in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -RRB- saying they will allow the Soviets to leave peacefully if the Soviets do not loot civilian houses as they depart,'' said the source, citing a diplomatic cable from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Similar arrangements may exist elsewhere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>First Drug Treatment Center Scrapped After Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first in-patient drug abuse treatment center has been scrapped following protests from residents, one of whom said addicts should be shot `` like vermin,'' a weekly newspaper reported. The treatment center was to have been housed in a small castle in <LOCATION> Tuchomerice </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, according to the popular weekly, <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON>. Opposition grew rapidly once word of the plans spread in a TV broadcast before authorities informed residents, <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> said. `` The TV statement was premature, ill-considered and resulted in hysteria,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> health official. `` Complaints poured in, then came a signature campaign of those protesting the plan _ simply, enormous pressure.'' He said the castle instead will be a center for the elderly, he said. <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> quoted unidentified doctors as complaining that drug addicts now can be treated only in a psychiatric ward in a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> suburb or at a center for alcoholics. <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> first reported on drug addicts last fall and said its stories on the Tuchomerice case brought `` an unprecedented response'' from readers. Some letters were sympathetic, but others used strong language. `` I would send them to forced labor or shoot them like vermin,'' wrote one unidentified reader. Only recently has drug abuse been discussed in the state-run media. In 1986, according to the latest statistics, 703 people were prosecuted on drugs-related charges, <PERSON> Vlasta </PERSON> said. It gave no figures for <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>.

 More than 1,000 mourners braved a driving rain today to attend a funeral service for 8-year-old <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, fatally wounded when a woman stormed an elementary school and fired on a second-grade classroom. Five other children were wounded in Friday's attack in nearby <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, who then shot and injured a man as she took over his family's home. She died at the house hours later of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. `` Nicky is gone _ long before his time, and the pain is great,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreibman </PERSON> told the gathering at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeremiah </ORGANIZATION> in this north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` I wonder what we could possibly say to relieve such unconscionable grief. But we can find none,'' said <PERSON> Schreibman </PERSON> in prepared remarks. Reporters were not allowed inside the temple for the half-hour service. Dozens of children, many of them in brightly colored rain slickers, walked solemnly into the temple before the service began. A memorial service was planned later today at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where Friday's shooting occurred. Classes were canceled today. At Temple <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON>, a sign saying `` Shalom'' _ which in Hebrew means peace, hello and goodbye _ was pasted on a south window. After the service, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>' parents, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>, and his brothers, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, accompanied the casket as it was placed in a hearse for the drive to Memorial Park Cemetery in nearby <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>. After Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s shooting rampage and suicide, authorities began trying to unravel the psychological puzzle she left behind. Before the school shooting, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had set fire to a home and delivered tainted treats to two college fraternities and several homes where she had worked as a baby sitter. Many of those who received the treats were on a list found in Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s apartment in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, according to police. They said no one was seriously sickened by the poisoned fruit juice and cereal snacks. `` This is a seriously destroyed individual who lost control and acted out all of her delusions,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Visotsky </PERSON>, professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` She acted on all the elements of revenge she wanted to play out. Once you begin imagining injury or pain, everyone has to be punished,'' he said Sunday. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> probably saw herself as a victim and sought revenge against those who had `` diminished her sense of self-worth,'' <PERSON> Visotsky </PERSON> said. `` There obviously is a connection with children here. We do n't know what,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said today on `` This Morning,'' the CBS morning show He said authorities `` are just keeping our fingers crossed that it is over.'' `` We've been surprised very often by <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON>, but we're ready for anything, to be honest with you,'' he said. `` We thought this nightmare ended Friday evening, but then Saturday morning of course we were surprised to find out about the poisoning situation.'' At Sunday religious services in the quiet <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, worshipers were asked to pray for Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> and her victims. Six people remain hospitalized, four in fair condition, one in critical condition and one listed as serious. `` Today we will pray for <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> because, for what she did, she could not have been in her right mind,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church. `` And because she was once a child and a Christian and ... because <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> prayed for his enemies.'' <PERSON> Visotsky </PERSON> and police agreed that the trigger for Friday's violence appeared to have been Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s discovery that a family for whom she worked as a baby sitter planned to move away On the morning of the shootings, Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> set a small fire in the family's house and gave tainted milk to two of the family's children She then drove to the school and shot a boy in a bathroom and brandished a handgun in the classroom, wounding five children, including young <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>. A substitute teacher, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, grabbed Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> in trying to stop her from shooting the entire classroom of youngsters. Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 29, refused to follow Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s orders to herd the 24 children together, and grabbed her gunhand before Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> pulled another weapon and began firing. `` I just acted instinctually. I just wanted to protect the children,'' said said Ms. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, adding that she `` just went on automatic pilot.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> then fled the school, crashed her car and ran to a home a few blocks away, where she wounded a 20-year-old man and barricaded herself inside for several hours before shooting herself in the head. Ms. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, daughter of a wealthy suburban family and former student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, was due to stand trial in Madison on charges of shoplifting several women's wigs March 14. She also was being sought by federal authorities for making threatening telephone calls in three states to former friends and members of her ex-husband's family.

 The town named after one of the 20th century's greatest athletes is planning a big party for his 100th birthday, although they're a year late according to folks <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s native state of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. This scenic <LOCATION> Carbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town is enjoying a renaissance that started about the time <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s body was laid to rest here. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s Mausoleum at the borough's east end was dedicated in 1957. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> officials plan to start the celebration Saturday by releasing balloons. Present will be former <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> football star <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednarik </PERSON> and an Indian princess to discuss <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s heritage. Several North American crabapple trees will be planted to beautify the mausoleum area. Runners are also being lined up to carry Olympic-style torches from the train station in downtown <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> to the mausoleum. And a huge birthday cake will be on display next to the train station for everyone present to taste. `` It'll be a traditional birthday party,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunsser </PERSON>, co-chairman of the centennial committee. `` We're not looking for a carnival atmosphere; we just want to say ` Happy Birthday' in a down-homey kind of way.'' In <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, however, sightseers and arts and crafts shoppers turned out Sunday for what they said was <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s 101st birthday. `` Everything went really nice,'' said <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, who spent the day dishing out cake and punch and giving people tours of her famous father's home. For several years, <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>'s birthdate has been a mystery. <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> never knew exactly when he was born, and his birth records were destroyed by fire. `` Records will show he was born in 1886, 1887, 1888; some will say May 22, some May 23,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> said. In 1979, she said she discovered her father's baptismal record, showing he was christened Nov. 17, 1887, and born May 22 of that year. Ms. <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, not one to play favorites with her father's birthday, said she plans to attend the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> celebration <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON> won fame in the 1912 Olympics, winning both the decathlon and pentathlon, but his medals were taken away a month later when Olympic officials determined that he had played baseball for a small salary before entering what was supposed to be an amateur competition.

 It took all of 21 seconds to hand out diplomas to <ORGANIZATION> Agate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s graduating class and for Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> to shake hands with the graduates. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> was class valedictorian, and <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> was the salutatorian.

 Vandals stenciled swastikas and scrawled an anti-Semitic slogan on a synagogue, prompting the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith to demand prison terms for such offenses and post a $ 1,000 reward for information. `` I'd like to see the steel doors slam shut behind someone this time,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelbaum </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> southern area director. `` Maybe that's what is needed to put a stop to this.'' The three swastikas and the words `` Die Jew'' were painted on the Bet Breira synagogue in suburban <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> over the weekend, police said. About 1 -LCB- miles away at <ORGANIZATION> Killian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, vandals also stenciled five swastikas, along with `` Neo-Nazi Rules'' and `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> <PERSON> Lives </PERSON>,'' police said.

Desecration of a house of worship is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. Teen-agers charged with throwing rocks and scrawling a swastika at a synagogue Feb. 26 recently were sentenced to 200 hours of community service, and had to pay for $ 14,800 in damage.

<HEAD>Party Meeting Shaping Up as Face-off on Reform Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Next month's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference is shaping up to be a face-off between supporters of radical change and advocates of just `` a little polishing up'' of the old Soviet system, party activists reported Monday. Despite efforts by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to draw only backers of his policy of `` perestroika,'' or wholesale rebuilding of Soviet society, some who fear reform is being introduced too quickly may be selected as delegates to the June 28 conference. A closed-door meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> devoted to preparations for next month's conference selected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to deliver the key address to the gathering, which will pass judgment on his reform program, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. But senior advisers on the economy and social trends made clear at a news conference that conflicting viewpoints on the pace of reform are becoming more apparent. It has not even been decided whether the party gathering _ the first of its kind since 1941 _ will be televised, according to delegate <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalygin </PERSON>, editor of the journal Novy Mir -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> addressed the plenary session of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before and after a debate among the more than 300 members, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. No details of his or other speeches were released. Kremlin No. 2 <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> told a foreign policy meeting later in the day that the plenum had `` a very interesting and lively debate'' over the proposals to be presented at the conference. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has made clear in previous speeches that he favors a more moderate pace of reform. The theses put together by the ruling 13-man Politburo make `` a number of important suggestions and proposals relative to the implementation of perestroika, glasnost, democratization and the implementation of a healthy political atmosphere,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. He gave no details, but said the proposals will be published before the conference. Four of the nation's most respected advisers on perestroika told reporters the conference is heightening differences among policy-makers. <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>, the nation's leading sociologist and a staunch reform advocate, said if perestroika is to succeed, `` we will have to fight and struggle for it to see that we meet these goals.'' She indicated there are two groups which want perestroika carried out differently. Asked who heads the factions, Ms. <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is obviously the figurehead for the radical-reform branch, but she said she did not know any leading `` personalities at the head of the other movement.'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is reputed to champion more conservative views on the Politburo, and last month was reported to have had a showdown with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> following publication of a defense of Stalinism in the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. But he has made several high-profile appearances, including his parliamentary address Monday, indicating he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are putting out a unified front leading up to the important conference. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that was published Sunday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> labeled as `` Western media'' creations those accounts that he and <PERSON> Legachev </PERSON> are locked in a struggle for power, although he acknowledged that `` heated debate'' has developed over perestroika within the nation. Party conferences, which consider major changes in direction in social and economic development, can be called between party congresses, which take place every five years. They were held frequently until World War II. Ms. <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> appeared to criticize the party's monopoly on power when asked about the system for selecting the 5,000 delegates to the conference. `` The fact that the party delegates are selected by the party machinery, by the party committees, effects the procedure, and not in every case can it be called a democratic effect,'' she said. It was not clear whether she was advocating extension of the delegate selection into non-party groups or criticizing some of the officials chosen. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms curry much less favor in rural regions and industrial zones outside the capital, where many entrenched party bureaucrats fear their jobs and privileges hang in the balance. In those areas, party conference delegates are likely to oppose radical change. On May 7, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for selection of those who would support his approach to reform. `` There must be no more quotas, as were the case in the past, specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women are to be elected, among others,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a gathering of media representatives and ideologists. `` The principal political directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to go to the conference.'' Little is known about the proposals to be put before the party conference next month, although several officials have said the delegates will consider limiting the tenure of the general secretary. There has also been speculation that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might take the opportunity to replace as much as 25 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ousting those who have not shown sufficient dedication to his reform programs. But <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a prominent political scientist and writer, told the news conference that `` as far as I know there would not be additional elections during this party conference.'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> and the other two officials who appeared at the news conference, is in the running to attend the party conference, although the selection procedures have not been completed. `` From my point of view the most important struggle is between those who want deep changes and others who want a little polishing up,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. `` The struggle is continuing in these areas.'' Economist <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> restated <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s philosophy that economic change and broader democracy must go hand in hand. `` One without the other is unthinkable,'' <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Party Changes Open Way for Reform in Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The reformers who now control the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> embarked Monday on a program of sweeping changes they hope will rescue the faltering economy. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s turn from old leadership to a new generation of highly trained managers, intellectuals and economic theorists may be the most dramatic change of course in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s liberal `` Prague Spring'' of 1968 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The most important difference is that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> now supports reform, under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' plan, and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion that drove <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> out is not likely to be repeated. An outline of Hungarian reform plans was revealed Sunday along with major changes in party leadership that replaced party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and many of his aging supporters. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, leader for nearly 32 years, was replaced by the reform-minded premier, <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, and top decision-making posts went to advocates of change. Delegates to the three-day party congress that ended Sunday dropped <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who will be 76 on May 26, from the ruling Politburo but elected him party president, a new post expected to be largely ceremonial. Some party officials said <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> might seek to wield a conservative influence from his new position, but the strength of reformers in the new leadership indicate they will be able to set policy. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, 57, will continue as premier until the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, when a replacement might be chosen. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wishes <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> well and `` we expect our good relationship with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will continue to improve.'' The new party policy statement approved Sunday gives few specifics, but calls for a greater public voice in economic and political affairs. It also contemplates a much larger role for private enterprise to revive the stagnant economy. `` The economy must be left alone to make its own decisions,'' <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Monday. `` The dullness of Hungarian political life in recent years has clouded the economic sphere.'' <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s government pioneered economic reforms, which brought relative prosperity from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Recent economic setbacks, however, have burdened <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest per capita foreign debt. It now stands $ 18 billion. Inflation is running at more than 18 percent annually and austerity measures have been imposed. In surprisingly frank debate, delegates to the congress assailed <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for not averting the economic crisis. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> party members, who make up almost one quarter of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 800,000 Communists, were among the most critical. They demanded new faces, new policies and a move toward political pluralism. Reformers argued that economic change would fail without similar action in the political field. While the policy document made clear the party's leading role was not being challenged, it referred frequently to the need for `` socialist pluralism'' in which opposing views would be allowed. It outlined the advantages of more foreign investment and joint ventures with foreign companies. Among political reforms endorsed were limited terms of office for party officials and laws guaranteeing freedom of association and other civil rights. `` The right of voluntary organization, assembly, association, freedom of conscience and religion ... and guarantees for the protection of individual and collective rights must be regulated by law,'' it said. A leading proponent of independent interest groups, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, was among those elected to the ruling Politburo. The pollicy statement acknowledged his recent comments by saying local referendums should be held on issues of importance to Hungarians. Many interest groups have been formed recently that do not seek official approval and range in nature from sports groups to an independent labor union. Another notable appointment to the Politburo was <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, the economist who pioneered reform in the late 1960s. He was ousted from the party's ruling body in in 1973 for advocating further changes. Thirty-one members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, nearly one-third of the total, were replaced by young intellectuals and workers. Few came from the party bureaucracy. Six members of the Politburo are new, including two women, and the membership was reduced from 13 to 11. Its first meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEAD>Oxford Blues: Prestigious Posts Vacant Due to Money Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is leaving two of the world's most prestigious academic posts vacant indefinitely, citing a financial crisis. The regius chairs in Greek and modern history become vacant in fall 1989 and wo n't be filled for at least a year, said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> spokeswoman. She said the regius chairs _ so named because they were created by royal command _ could remain frozen beyond 1990, depending on faculty priorities. The decision heightens longstanding concern over the ancient university's future as a citadel of scholarship and scientific research. `` There is a question mark over our status as a world-class university,'' Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the retiring regius professor of modern history, said in an interview. `` We are being starved of essential resources.'' The regius chair in Greek was founded by King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> in 1546, and the modern history chair by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> in 1727. Both are widely regarded as being at the apex of scholarship. They being left vacant as part of a retrenchment program brought on by an 11 percent cut in government funding, Mrs. <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. Under the program, any academic post that becomes vacant is frozen, usually for two years, until the <ORGANIZATION> Faculty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> decides whether there is enough money to appoint a successor. As a result, 122 of <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,420 faculty posts in virtually all disciplines are vacant, Mrs. <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. Failure to exempt the professorships in modern history and Greek from the retrenchment reflects the seriousness of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s cash problem. <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> has a budget of about $ 186 million, and its deficit is running at about $ 3.3 million. The university has announced that it will launch a five-year, worldwide campaign in October to ensure the future of the university, which received its first charter in 1213. It has not said how much money it wants to raise in its campaign, but says it hopes to ensure the financial security of the university into the next century. `` <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> is beginning to seem like a place under siege,'' the author A.N. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> wrote Monday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. Commenting on the professorial vacancies, the deterioration of books and manuscripts in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s Bodleian Library and the planned closure of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said: `` When you have a university which ca n't afford professors of Greek and history; which ca n't afford to repair the priceless books on its library shelves; which ca n't afford to keep open one of the most famous undergraduate theaters in the world, then you are entitled to ask: What is going on?'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who is retiring one year early to take up a newly created chair in military history at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1989, said his post could remain vacant for several years. `` There's simply not enough money to go around,'' he said. <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 44 other state-funded universities have long complained that spending limits imposed by the Conservative government are threatening the nation's scientific base and accelerating a brain drain to foreign universities. Critics say the government is denying support for research that has no apparent short-term economic or military benefit. In a 1985 protest, <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> denied an honorary doctorate to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, herself an Oxford graduate in chemistry. `` There is a lack of understanding of the value of scholarship as an end of itself, irrespective of whether it contributes to the national income or not,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Government officials contend the universities are overly dependent on state funding and have refused to aggressively pursue money from industry or even their own alumni. The regius professor of Greek, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd-Jones </PERSON>, who is leaving next year at the mandatory retirement age of 67, said the failure to name his replacement goes beyond government policy, and reflects the values of society at large. `` We have a society in which a footballer gets four times as much as Sir <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and I get together,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd-Jones </PERSON>. `` Someone who displays himself on television can get 10 times as much.'' The base salary for each regius chair is about $ 48,620 a year. <PERSON> Lloyd-Jones </PERSON> said the vacant posts should serve as `` a reminder to anyone who thinks that we in the 20th century live in a civilized society.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> is moving fast to become self-sufficient, but `` there is a limit to what we can do over the short term.''

<HEAD>Surrogate Mothers, Including Baby M's, Would Ban Baby Brokers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A coalition of 17 surrogate mothers, including landmark surrogate <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, launched a campaign Monday to try to force baby brokers in 12 states out of business. `` Try to help shut these places down,'' implored Whitehead-Gould, whose precedent-setting `` Baby M'' story was the subject of a network television movie this week. Whitehead-Gould, whose effort to void her surrogating contract was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, called on state legal systems and the media to join in a campaign against surrogacy. She was accompanied by other members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrogacy </ORGANIZATION>, a group comprising lawyers, doctors and 17 surrogate mothers. Coalition leader <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said the group on Monday sent petitions to attorneys general in 12 states where surrogate brokers are known to operate. Such brokers charge a fee to set up agreements linking infertile couples with women willing to bear them a child. `` These are the middlemen who have engaged in the unconscionable act of hiring women as breeders,'' <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said the coalition will mount a four-pronged attack against the brokers. Along with legal pressure, the group will attempt to marshal public opinion in states where brokers do business, and try to force the issue of surrogate parenting into local and national politics. Finally, <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON> said, the coalition will target newspapers that run advertising on behalf of surrogate brokers or agencies. `` We're going to put all the brokers on notice,'' said <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, an environmental activist who also has been critical of the new science of genetic engineering. States where brokers operate, according to the coalition, are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Corea </PERSON>, the coalition's co-chairwoman, accused brokers of preying on lower-income women who need the money but may not understand the implication of signing away unborn children. The surrogates are often abused physically and psychologically by brokers, <PERSON> Corea </PERSON> claimed. `` We want this surrogacy industry gone. Let it stop feeding off our flesh,'' <PERSON> Corea </PERSON> said. Surrogate mother <PERSON> Lauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> pleaded, `` Please, before they wreck any more lives, before they cause any more pain, please close them down.'' <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said she gave up her twins to an infertile couple because she and her husband could n't afford to raise them. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> became the nation's best-known surrogate after she refused to surrender her infant daughter to its biological father and his wife. A state court upheld the father's $ 10,000 contract. But the contract was voided in February by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, even though the court allowed the girl's father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, to maintain custody of the child. Last month Whitehead-Gould struck an agreement with <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> giving her liberalized visitation rights. The case is the subject of the made-for-television film, `` Baby M,'' which aired Sunday and Monday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> criticized the film as inaccurate.

<HEAD>Court To Study States' Power to Regulate Natural Gas Production</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to study the power of states to regulate natural gas production, including `` use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production. The court will review a ruling that upheld the power of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials to control production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas reservoir in the world. The justices are not expected to decide the case until 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that officials said would encourage production, prevent economic and physical waste and protect the rights of producers. At issue is gas from the <LOCATION> Hugoton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which extends across portions of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. About two-thirds of the field is in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since 1944 imposed rules aimed at assuring that each well will ultimately produce approximately the amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder. The idea was to treat well owners equally, since gas can migrate underground from an underproducing area to a well that is overproducing. To assure equal treatment, the state fixed the maximum amount of gas that can be produced per month from each well. In practice, wells can not always be operated to meet monthly ceilings for various reasons. For example, a well may be shut in or there may be low demand in a given month and therefore the well underproduces. To allow for these variables, state officials permitted owners of underproducing wells to `` save up'' their production ceilings _ creating what are called `` underages'' _ and overproduce in future months to make up for shortfalls. To create a production incentive, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> commission changed the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within specified periods of years or they would be canceled. The use-it-or-lose-it rule was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major buyers of the <ORGANIZATION> Hugoton </ORGANIZATION> gas for transport outside the state. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> said the 1983 rule change prevents it from purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to by contract. The pipeline company said cancellation of the underages means that it unfairly may lose reservoirs of gas when they migrate underground and later are replaced by other migrating supplies. The pipeline company asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to strike down the 1983 regulations on grounds that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has exclusive authority over natural gas production. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sided with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials in urging the high court not to disturb the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> commission lawfully is regulating production and is not directly regulating the interstate pipeline companies that are subject to federal authority. The department said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> case is distinct from a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 that added a new limitation on states' power to regulate natural gas prices The court said then that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> may not require an interstate pipeline to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool when the pipeline had pre-existing contracts with only some of the owners. The case acted on Monday is <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 86-1856.

 The Soviet parliament endorsed the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty Monday but a top official said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> should not ratify the superpower agreement before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> does. Members of the foreign affairs committees of the Supreme Soviet's two chambers met in a brief joint session to unanimously endorse the treaty and send it to the Presidium, the highest executive body, for ratification. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the pact to destroy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles, on Dec. 8 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> They begin another summit Sunday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and hope the treaty will be ratified before it ends. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, No. 2 in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, presided at the meeting of about 20 committee members. It was the culmination of a process begun Feb. 9, when Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> appeared before lawmakers to speak for the treaty. By approving ratification, the committees set the stage for final action by the Presidium, which ratifies international agreements. Soviet ratification has been considered certain because the treaty was endorsed by the Politburo, supreme body of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and signed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who is both <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and a Presidium member. Soviet officials have acknowldged, however, that they want the formal ratification processes in both countries to proceed together. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is not expected to act on the treaty this week. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> arms control and disarmament desk, told Western reporters his country should not ratify the treaty before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think it depends on the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said at the end of the committee meeting, which lasted just over an hour. `` I think we should wait for the decision to be made. We should be sure that we are not alone.'' The Soviets have said past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions on arms control treaties made them wary of moving too rapidly with ratification of the latest agreement. In 1979, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signed SALT II setting limits on long-range nuclear weapons. President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> withdrew it from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration after the Soviets sent soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December of that year. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said endorsement by the Supreme Soviet committees showed his country supports the treaty, and declared: `` We are ready to ratify it, and -LRB- they -RRB- have recommended to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to ratify it.'' Tuesday is opening day for the regular spring session of the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, but there has been no official indication it will act on the treaty. A vote by the full membership is not needed for ratification. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> foreign affairs secretary and former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, expressed hope at the committee meeting that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would act on the treaty before the summit. <PERSON> Dobrynin </PERSON> attended the meeting as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the Soviet of Nationalties. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> chairs the equivalent committee in the other chamber, the Soviet of the Union. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said earlier Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification during the summit remains possible but some senators still have questions about the treaty. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Republican, told CBS News that three conservative Republicans still want to debate some issues and that `` will take a good part of this week to conclude.'' At least 67 votes in the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are required for ratification. On April 20, a commission created by the two committees of the Supreme Soviet recommended ratification. Its chairman, <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornienko </PERSON>, said at the Monday meeting the treaty would remove `` two links of the nuclear chain that have circled our <LOCATION> Mother </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Vote Tuesday On New Tahoe City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATELINE, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters in several resort communities decide Tuesday whether to form a new city to be called <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, a measure opposed by casinos but favored by residents demanding more for their taxes. The new city, with a population of about 6,500, would embrace the gambling resort of <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> and would be situated along 15 miles of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>'s southeastern shore. Fewer than 3,000 registered voters in the <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are expected to go to the polls Tuesday to decide on the measure, which has generated some 20 years of debate, hearings and court battles. If the plan is approved, another election will be held to organize the government. Proponents of the new city say the lakeshore communities comprise nearly 25 percent of the county's population while contributing 60 percent of the tax revenue. They say they do not receive a proportionate share in services. `` We want to keep our tax dollars here,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigham </PERSON>, a leader of the movement to create the city <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>, leader of the opposition, said a city government will only raise taxes without a corresponding improvement in services The opposition has received financial support from the <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, whose tax burden <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> said would rise by at least $ 300,000 yearly under a city government. `` What will they get for it? Not much,'' he added. <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners also advised against the idea. The county has said it stands to lose about $ 1.8 million in yearly tax revenue, most of it from the big <LOCATION> Stateline </LOCATION> casinos, if voters approve the plan, because property and gaming taxes will shift from the county to city. The plan also produced an unsuccessful challenge in state court last year and complaints from communities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, on the western side of the lake, that the name <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahoe </PERSON> would create confusion in the public mind between <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> the lake and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> the city. The new city, which would embrace such communities as <LOCATION> Glenbrook </LOCATION>, Zephyr Cove, <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Cave Rock and <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, could n't start its business before July 1, 1989.

<HEAD>Iranian Ships Maneuver in Hormuz; U.S. Ships Steam Through Suez</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Several Iranian warships conducted maneuvers Monday in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, apparently trying to show continued readiness despite recent losses. Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships destined for duty in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> passed through the Suez Canal on Monday. The destroyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> and missile frigates Fahrion, <PERSON> Halyburton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> are to replace a missile cruiser and four frigates at the end of this month. Gulf shipping executives said a large Iranian vessel that may have been a destroyer, two frigates and a landing craft were seen near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval base at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. They said the ships could not be identified with certainty, but the largest appeared to be a destroyer that has not been active for more than a year in the gulf, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. The executives spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has three destroyers, built during World War II for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They were modernized in the early 1970s with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, radar and other equipment. None has been seen in many months, leading military analysts to speculate they were out of commission. Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships, said the status of the former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer <PERSON> Damavand </PERSON> was `` very doubtful'' but at least one, and probably both, former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships were operational. The Iranians said Sunday it was conducting naval exercises in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. It said about 50 ships were involved, including `` missile carrying destroyers, destroyers, missile launching frigates and personnel carriers.'' Their official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the maneuvers, called Zolfaqar-3, would last several days. It said they would involve `` land, sea and air operations and ... the latest technology in sea wars,'' including radar and radio jamming, aerial target tracking, paratroop drops, mine sweeping and interception of air raids. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a naval intelligence officer it did not name as saying the exercises were aimed at `` disproving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that it had crippled half the hardware of the Iranian navy.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of providing assistance for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets that made a devastating air strike May 14 on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Larak island oil terminal in <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the narrow southern gateway to the gulf, in which five tankers were damaged. On Apri1 18, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and planes sank or disabled six Iranian naval craft in a series of clashes. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s losses included the British-built frigate Sahand, a fast attack boat and two armed speedboats sunk, the frigate Sabalan disabled and a speedboat probably sunk. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has acknowledged damage to several ships, including the <LOCATION> Sahand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sabalan </LOCATION>, and more than 40 sailors killed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> casualties were two Marine pilots killed when their AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost. The Iranians claim they shot it down. Since the clashes in April, the `` rules of engagement'' for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships have been changed so they can intervene in attacks by Iranian vessels on neutral ships in international waters. Iranian speedboats have raided two ships in <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> in the past week, but there have been no confrontations with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> since April 18. None of the larger Iranian vessels sighted Monday were involved in that fighting. The only one seen previously, on May 10, was the Alvand, a sister ship of the two frigates hit last month. Western analysts have said the other frigate, <LOCATION> Alborz </LOCATION>, was non-operational but senior <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said recently that both were back on duty.

 Sikh worshipers sobbed as they entered the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for the first time since the sacred shrine was reopened after a two-week siege in which at least 46 people died, a city official said. Over 15,000 Sikh men, women and children waited solemnly in the 113-degree heat as security officials frisked them for weapons before allowing them to enter the 400-year-old temple. It was closed during a police siege May 9-18 aimed at driving Sikh separatists from their hiding places inside. At least 46 people, mostly Siklh militants, died during the clashes. Amitsar deputy commissioner <PERSON> Sarabjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said no incidents of violence were reported Monday. `` We had a few emotional ourbrusts by some of the devotees,'' he added. Some wept as they walked past the rooms from which Sikh radicals shot back at <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> security men during the siege. `` I knew some of the boys, they were brave, maybe misguided,'' said <PERSON> Harbans </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 70, a Sikh farmer. `` The government operation has hurt our sentiment, there was no need to kill so many people,'' said Surinder Kaur of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> quoted a majority of the worshipers praising the government action. Religious services in the inner sanctum of the temple, suspended on the second day of the siege, were resumed Sunday after volunteers washed the floor of the temple with milk in a cleansing ritual. Police and paramilitary troops cordoned off the shrine to enforce a curfew still imposed on the area within 300 yards of its walls. Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the cordon would be lifted after the government reaches an agreement with temple officials to stop the shrine from being used as a hideout for Sikh radicals. Sikh gunmen, meanwhile, shot and killed four people in other parts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state in overnight attacks, police said. Among the victims was a Hindu school headmaster, <PERSON> Tilak </PERSON> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON>, who was shot and killed Monday by two Sikh radicals in front of 400 students in the town of <LOCATION> Sangatpura </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The assailants ordered him out of his office and shot him at point-blank range with a revolver, according to <PERSON> Gurmeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a police officer. A note left by the <ORGANIZATION> Khalistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the Sikh separatist groups, said <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> was killed to avenge the siege of the Golden Temple. The note said more killings would follow. Sikh separatists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in this agricultural state, where they form a majority of the population. The Sikhs, whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s warring Hindus and Moslems, make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people. They claim they are discriminated against by the majority, which is 80 percent Hindu. Monday's killings raised to more than 1,150 the number of people killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state since the start of the year. In 1987, 1,030 people were killed.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose relations with the business community have been mixed during his tenure as Massachussetts governor, is not willing to concede business support to its traditional home in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Business leaders aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner's campaign hope to sign up a minimum of 5,000 executives nationwide for a national business coalition, with group leaders appearing on behalf of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at conventions and other events <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with his entrepreneurial background and Republican pedigree, has a ready-made base of support in the business arena. But organizers of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> effort, to be officially announced when leadership roles are filled, say their venture into traditionally Republican circles has been well received because of dissatisfaction with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of the trade and budget deficits. `` The conventional question about the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s candidates is their ability to make the hard economic decisions, the business decisions,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, a wealthy businessman and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top fund-raiser `` For the first time in 20 years, we've got a candidate with credibility on the economy and a record of fiscal responsibility.'' The first phase of the effort involves recruiting professionals who have donated to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. Farmer has given <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Giesser </PERSON>, who is organizing the coalition, lists of contributors with business ties. `` That's where you start,'' said Farmer. `` If you already bet $ 2 on a horse race you're apt to root for that horse all the way around the track.'' <PERSON> Giesser </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachussetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, declined to list prospective members of the group.

Another recent addition is prominent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, who promised to recruit 400 to 500 business officials in his state `` I think we will be able to organize such a group around the country that -LRB- it -RRB- will surprise people,'' said <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> last week. `` Much of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> takes business for granted,'' he said. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, termed it unlikely that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could pull support of a majority of top business leaders. `` But I think you're going to find that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to have some success in getting serious business support,'' he said. `` It can help. He's running the umbrella type campaign and trying to keep the umbrella as big as possible. The more support he gets from credible people in business and other groups, the more credence people will give to his message.'' <PERSON> Hensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cullinane </PERSON> are among <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top business backers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ proponents of public-private partnerships that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has promoted to steer companies to economically struggling areas of the state. Many other high-tech officials have long battled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on issues ranging from state spending to environmental policy, and small businessmen lately have criticized a new state law that requires most employers to give workers health insurance by 1992. Even his detractors believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have at least limited success in lining up business support. `` We've been saying for some time that he has been overspending,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` But how many business people in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> are really going to care about that?'' The council was established in 1977, near the end of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first term as governor, by high tech executives dissatisfied with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record on taxes and economic development Lobbying pressure from the influential group led to several economic development programs that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> now touts on the campaign trail. Members of the high-tech group also have complained that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes too much credit for the state economy. But <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said the so-called `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' and political momentum will attract business officials to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Business and labor and every other constituency will be anxious to be with a winner,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` That's human nature.''

 Students hurling firebombs and rocks attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic office Monday as thousands of demonstrators battled riot police for a sixth consecutive day in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The attack did not damage the single-story <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building. Police said they fired tear gas to thwart the attack by bands of students shouting anti-U.S. slogans and hurling firebombs at the building in the provincial city 165 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. At least four policemen were reported injured. The Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said police arrested two protesters who scaled the roof of an annex to the <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> building and tossed five firebombs that smashed several rooftiles, but caused no fire. A student was seen unfolding an anti-U.S. placard at the top of a nearby building, while another 100 students surged out of sidestreets to hurl rocks and about 30 firebombs that exploded around the gate and walls of the <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> office. Also on Monday, groups of students attacked four police stations in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, smashing windows and doors before being driven off. Clashes between police and some 1,000 protesters also broke out in downtown <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> after dark, the agency said. The firebomb attack followed demonstrations Monday at <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where police fired barrages of tear gas to stop about 3,000 students and dissidents trying to march off campus `` Down with the military dictatorship!'' and `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' the demonstrators shouted as they called for a full investigation into the South Korean army's bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in which about 200 people were killed. Thousands of demonstrators have clashed with police in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> since rallies began Wednesday marking the eighth anniversary of the uprising. Anti-U.S. sentiment has been running high in the recent wave of protests, with students demanding the removal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has denied any involvement in the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> incident, but dissidents contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condoned the movement of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> soldiers to suppress the protests. Under a mutual defense pact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> controls both Korean troops and 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers stationed here. Last week, protesters broke windows and hurled firebombs at the <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and hurled home made bombs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. A policeman and two students were hurt in the incident. But other parts of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were reported quiet Monday after five days of anti-government demonstrations that often turned into violent clashes with riot police in the streets and on campuses.

 A rum warehouse converted into a new Tate Gallery of modern art opens Tuesday as the crown jewel in the revived waterfront of this economically depressed port city. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> accepted <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s invitation to open the `` Tate of the North,'' a permanent gallery housing more than 200 20th century works of art from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Tate Gallery. `` The prince's visit is symbolic of the turnaround in our city,'' said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have been hit hard and we are delighted that His Royal Highness is coming here just as the tide is starting to flow economically again in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>'s direction,'' he said in an interview. The Tate is on 140-year-old <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dock </PERSON> in the city that was founded on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> trade in cotton, tobacco, sugar, rum and African slaves. It is named after its Victorian benefactor, sugar cane magnate Sir <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a Liverpudlian whose sugar was imported through the docks. The new northern gallery is the first endeavor by a state museum in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to show its works on a large scale outside the capital city. `` We will change the displays and exhibitions every nine months and I expect half a million visitors a year,'' said curator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. `` The aim has been to take works out of storage and put them in a place where they would be of benefit.'' The first displays include surrealist art such as <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>'s `` Lobster Telephone,'' British sculpture of the past 20 years and a room of abstract paintings by the late American <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothko </PERSON>. `` I am absolutely delighted at this move,'' said Sir <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowness </PERSON>, who directs the Tate Gallery holdings of 40,000 works, representing all British art and international 20th century art. `` Our space in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is large enough to show only about 15 percent of our modern art _ because modern art works tend to be big _ and <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> will raise that to 25 percent.'' The international council of the Museum of Modern Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> visited <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> on Saturday to see how the five-story warehouse of red bricks and stone, supported by cast-iron columns, was converted at a cost of nearly $ 14 million by architect <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirling </PERSON>. `` It was filthy and ruinous when I saw it, with dead pigeons lying everywhere, the roof collapsed and water pouring in,'' <PERSON> Stirling </PERSON> said. `` I was glad to work on it, as it is perhaps the most magnificent dock of its type ever built in this country.'' Said gallery staffer <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 23: `` My friends here have a bit of a giggle about modern art, which is an unknown quantity in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>.'' `` But there's a great spirit of pride in this city, and not just because we're the Beatles' hometown. We all want to get involved in helping it,'' she added. Government and business moved to help <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> with millions of pounds in cash grants in 1977 after the decline of the docks, shipbuilding and automaking. Investment expanded after 1981 riots by the unemployed in the <LOCATION> Toxteth </LOCATION> district led to one death, 3,000 arrests and streets of homes and shops set ablaze. The city of 476,500 people still has a jobless rate of 25 percent and is having to overcome a history of strikes and leftist political anarchy on the city council. Keynote of the revival is the transformation of the once-abandoned city center docks along the <LOCATION> Mersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> river </LOCATION> into a leisure area of museums, shops, offices, apartments and businesses. `` The first sign we had that things were changing was one year ago when employers reported shortages of skilled workers,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The docks are busy again because <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> businessmen are realizing that <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> is still the nearest port to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Cancer Institute Hopes To Double Number of Patients in Cancer
Experments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will try to double over the next four years the number of patients who receive experimental treatments in an effort to speed up the search for ways to stop the biggest cancer killers. Largely because of physicians' reluctance to enroll their patients in cancer experiments, officials said, it may take 10 years or longer to assess the value of promising new therapies. `` We are not getting enrolled anywhere near the number of patients we need to get answers within a reasonable period of time,'' Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the cancer institute, said at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oncology </ORGANIZATION>. Currently, about 25,000 cancer patients each year are enrolled in treatment experiments, known as clinical trials, that are sponsored by the cancer institute. Through appeals to doctors and directly to the public, the institute hopes to double this by 1992. Clinical trials are medicine's primary way of figuring out whether new drugs and combinations of surgery and radiation are better than the standard ways of coping with the disease. Typically, patients are randomly assigned to have the standard treatment or the new form of therapy. Only about 1 percent of patients with colon or breast cancer are currently enrolled in clinical trials. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said the institute hopes to increase this to 10 percent. The goal is to enroll all the patients who will take part in an experiment within one year, instead of over three, five or even 10 years, as often now happens. Once patients are enrolled, doctors must wait five years to see which treatment worked best. <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said patients are often worried about taking part in cancer experiments. `` The public is confused,'' he said. `` They think they are guinea pigs, that they will get nothing and we'll just watch their tumors grow. That's not the case.'' Instead, <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> maintained that participants in clinical trials get the best available treatment, even if they are assigned to the comparison group that does n't get the experimental therapy. However, experts said that the unwillingness of doctors, not patients, is the primary obstacle to increasing the number of patients in clinical trials. Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, who has been conducting clinical trials since the 1950s, said doctors often want to stick with the style of care they learned in medical school and are also afraid they will lose control of their patients' treatments Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittes </PERSON>, head of the cancer institute's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, added, `` The main problem of participating in trials is that they take time.'' He said physicians are reluctant to spend time explaining the treatment trials to their patients and keeping up with the paper work involved. Another study, presented at the conference, suggested that many doctors believe they already know what kind of treatment is best. Dr. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> surveyed 300 physicians in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who treat cancer of the bladder, kidneys and prostate gland. Seventy percent responded that if they had one of these kinds of cancer, they would not enroll themselves in a clinical trial. Instead, they would prefer the kind of therapy they already offer their patients. <PERSON> Wittes </PERSON> said the cancer institute is trying to appeal to doctors' sense of public duty `` We are saying, ` You will do good for society, and you will do good for your patients.''' <PERSON> Wittes </PERSON> said the cancer institute will concentrate at first in enrolling more patients in clinical trials of new treatments for <PERSON> non-Hodgkin </PERSON>'s lymphoma and cancers of the breast, colon, rectum and bladder.

 Against a backdrop of nearly 200 police officers, Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> signed a law Monday making <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials. `` This is the first time a legislature has stood up and said, ` These guns are wrong,''' the governor said. He said the measure is a step toward stopping `` the senseless killing on our streets.'' Looking on was White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was wounded by a Saturday Night Special in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, had lobbied for the bill `` I'd like to see other states like dominoes fall into line,'' said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who has been in a wheelchair since the shooting. `` Thumbs up for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.'' `` I ca n't think of a sweeter, more wonderful day. This is indeed a great step for public safety,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. In the last 20 years, Saturday Night Specials have been used to kill 250,000 people and injure 1 -LCB- million, she said. The law makes it illegal after Jan. 1, 1990, to sell or manufacture a Saturday Night Special in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. It will not be against the law to own such weapons. The measure also sets up a nine-member board appointed by the governor to prepare a list of handguns that may be sold. Weapons that are easily concealed, inaccurate, unsafe and poorly made will be banned under the law. The bill also allows the board to ban plastic guns that can be slipped through metal detectors. Nearly 200 uniformed police officers from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> witnessed the signing in an effort by the governor to demonstrate wide support among law enforcement agencies. Gun owners, backed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, already are collecting signatures to put the law to a vote in a referendum in November. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the organization had no comment on the bill. He referred callers to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> the Gun Ban. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Griisser </PERSON>, a spokesman for the committe, said he does n't have a count on the number of signatures collected so far, but that he is confident his organization will meet the requirement of 33,044 to put the bill to a vote After that, `` it will be an uphill battle to explain the true nature of the law to the voters,'' he said. Under the law, manufacturers can be fined up to $ 10,000 and dealers and gun owners up to $ 2,500 for each violation. Each time a gun is made or sold constitutes a separate violation. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who has been campaigning nationally for tougher gun laws since her husband was shot, said the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> approach solves the difficult problem of trying to define Saturday Night Specials by leaving the decision to a review board. The board will consist of three citizen members, the superintendent of state police and one representative each of a state prosecutors association, the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marylanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> gun manufacturer.

 A Brooklyn-born art scholar with the air of a British gentleman was sentenced Monday to three years in prison for transporting stolen documents belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, 60, also was ordered to repay $ 20,000 to a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bookstore that bought some of the documents. Mount predicted he would win an appeal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> sentenced <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> to two three-year prison terms, but suspended the second term and instead ordered <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> to serve five years' probation after his release. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had recommended a total prison sentence of eight years, while defense attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> requested a suspended sentence. Mount, who was convicted April 11, could have received up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> McGinty </PERSON> asked Monday that <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> be allowed to remain free long enough to help prepare for a trial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on charges of possessing federal property. Ms. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> ordered Mount taken into custody pending her decision on the request. Before the sentence was read, Mount professed his innocence in a rambling 35-minute speech to Ms. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> about how he was the victim of libel and plagiarism by envious historians. Ms. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> told Mount: `` You continue to proclaim your innocence. However, the jury did not believe your testimony. ... You stole those documents from us all. Those documents belong to the national heritage.'' An art historian and a Guggenheim Foundation fellow at the age of 26, Mount was accused of selling letters by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> <PERSON> Whistler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> that belonged to the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Last July he sold the letters to <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> dealer of rare books and documents A month later, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested the dapper historian at the bookshop while he tried to sell letters and papers bearing the signatures of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and Civil War generals. The documents were taken from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the documents had been stored in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> during the trial but will be returned to the institutions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Mount claimed the documents belonged to him for years and that he showed them to two Irish men while living in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> in the 1960s. But his legal troubles left him broke and he could n't afford to bring the witnesses to his trial, he said. The federal government seized his $ 18,400 in savings after his arrest. That money will now go to repay <PERSON> Goodspeed </PERSON>'s. During his three-week trial, <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> protested that he was n't being allowed to present his side of the case He claimed he was being railroaded because the government would not pay to bring the witnesses from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Despite having a British-sounding accent, <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> started in life as <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, N.Y. He changed his name in the 1950s.

 A proposed change in federal regulations would hold farmers and others in the marketing chain financially accountable for livestock carcasses condemned at slaughter plants because of illegally high traces of drugs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. B.H. `` Bill'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stockyards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal is intended to deter the sale of medicated aniamls for slaughter and shift economic responsibility for illegal drug residues from the meat packer to those who cause the violation. Under the proposal, a meat packer would be able to `` bill back'' the person from whom the livestock was bought if it is condemned because of illegal drug residues. In order to make the plan work, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, each purchaser or selling agency in the marketing chain would be permitted to use the bill-back procedure. If a seller failed to settle up, the buyer or selling agency would be permitted to deduct from a subsequent purchase from the same person. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that although a small percentage of livestock producers are selling medicated animals for slaughter, the illegally high drug residues continue to be a problem, notably in swine, culled dairy cows and young calves. The proposal will be open 60 days for public comment. Those can be sent to: <ORGANIZATION> Packers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stockyards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, Room 3039-S, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20250.

 An escaped inmate accompanied by his stepdaughter and the wife he married while in prison remained at large Monday and may be driving a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> rented by his wife, authorities said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, took two guards hostage at gunpoint and escaped Sunday in a prison jeep, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> of the medium-security <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Day and the two guards then went to a Holiday Inn where his wife was waiting with a getaway car. The woman was accompanied by her 9-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said Monday. Day left one guard handcuffed to the jeep's steering wheel and the other to a towel bar in a room registered to Day's wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caraveo </PERSON> Day. <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said the guard in the hotel room freed himself in time to watch from a window as the Days got into a silver <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities found that car abandoned here and believe Mrs. Day rented a Cadillac from <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> at the Columbus airport. They said Day had paid a man they refused to identify to drive them to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. `` At this point, we have an all-points bulletin out throughout <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and in surrounding states,'' <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said Monday. `` We're pursuing some leads, but I ca n't comment on them. <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> could not say what type of gun was used in the escape, but said authorities `` are working on the assumption it's the same gun he has now.'' He said the gun apparently came from a source outside the prison. `` It was an obvious breach of security and we're very concerned about that,'' <PERSON> Prosser </PERSON> said. Prison spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said patrol officials and prison Superintendent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> questioned the two guards late Sunday night.

 The paralyzed woman whose right-to-die court fight set a precedent says she temporarily has abandoned plans to starve herself to death. Frail, bedridden <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouvia </PERSON> said she still wants her life to end, but added in an interview with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times: `` If I tried to starve myself, I would be publicly shunned. Starving myself would take too long. I wish there was a quicker way.'' The 30-year-old former social worker, crippled by cerebral palsy, lives in reclusion at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-University of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she passes her time watching television and smoking 1 -LCB- packs of cigarettes a day. Weighing 90 pounds, up from 68, Ms. <PERSON> Bouvia </PERSON> said she eats at least one meal a day. She is registered at the hospital as a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> and lives in one of the hospital's few isolation rooms. She has left the room six times in the last two years _ once to see a dentist, the other times to make telephone calls. She said she last tried to starve herself in January 1987, but gave up when she learned she would have to endure several painful weeks before dying. Her 1986 court battles against hospitals where doctors force-fed her rather than allow her to die established case law defending patients' rights to control medical treatment, regardless of age, health or motives. She has visitors about once a week, and her family in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> travels south to see her a few times a year, she said. Nonetheless, she abhors her condition. `` The thought of being here another 10 years, I just ca n't fathom,'' she said `` I would rather die than live here.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> review began Monday of proposed changes in an air-sea rescue training program suspended since the March 2 drowning of a recruit. Six sailors accused in the drowning also face a public hearing Wednesday as <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials denied charges by the man's family that they were slow to investigate his death. Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died while allegedly held in the pool by instructors. The review of recommended changes at the <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is closed to the public, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, a spokesman for Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman. The school at the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> had a 40 percent attrition rate and already was under study prior to the death, said <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON>, chief of naval education and training. He added that such high rates often mean `` we have n't put the right people there and we have n't prepared them properly for training.'' <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died after instructors allegedly dragged him into a pool against his will and held his head under water after he failed a drill. Other recruits reportedly were told to turn their backs to the pool and sing `` The Star-Spangled Banner'' as loudly as they could to drown out <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s screams for help. Family members say they were told <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death was an accident, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> initially attributed his death to natural causes. They complain that they had to wait two months before getting any official word on how he died. The five instructors were charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. Their commanding officer was charged with dereliction of duty. The Wednesday hearing is the military's equivalent to a grand jury inquiry, though some differences exist, including it being open to the public. Lt. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, a public affairs officer, said portions of the hearing might be closed for legal reasons, however. The presiding officer, Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. D'Alesio of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, will recommend whether the charges should go to court-martial, be dismissed or handled through non-judicial penalties. The accused sailors could be dismissed from the service if they are found guilty at a court-martial. Those charged with involuntary manslaughter also could be imprisoned up three years. Their commander could face three months.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, the real-life mother of Baby M, says she's not impressed with the television film about her groundbreaking surrogate motherhood. `` I think the only truth in the whole thing ... was my dog and the nine puppies,'' said <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday to join in a call to end commercialized surrogate parenting. She said she saw only the second hour of the film, broadcast Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> network. The movie, `` Baby M,'' was to conclude Monday night. She called the film a `` whitewashed'' depiction of the surrogate agreement and ensuing battle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> courts that made her the nation's best-known surrogate. She said she was particularly upset by the film's shallow portrayal of her ex-husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>. The Whiteheads were divorced this year, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> married <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. The couple had a child earlier this month. Whitehead-Gould gained fame after she refused to surrender her infant daughter to its biological father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> and his wife sued, and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state court last year upheld the contract under which Whitehead-Gould accepted a $ 10,000 fee to bear <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s child. The contract was voided in February by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, although the court let the Stern's keep the child they named <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>. Whitehead-Gould has visitation rights. The made-for-television film stars <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as Whitehead-Gould. The film, based entirely on court records, was made without the cooperation of Whitehead-Gould or the Sterns.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Monday welcomed the first Soviet delegation to visit a chemical warfare facility in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Thirteen Soviet scientists and military experts will spend three days inspecting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chemical warfare defense center and related facilities in southwestern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and talking with British chemical weapons experts. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> stopped making chemical weapons in the 1950s and destroyed its stockpiles in 1957. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said it will be the first exchange visit on chemical weapons between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a Western European country. `` It is intended that the full range of chemical warfare-related issues should be discussed ... including production, assessment of the chemical warfare hazards, storage, trials, detection, protection, monitoring, decontamination, medical countermeasures and disposal,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, minister of state for the Armed Forces. The visiting delegation is led by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, the chief Soviet negotiatior at the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Disarmament and includes Maj. Gen. R.F. <PERSON> Razuvanov </PERSON>, commander of the Soviet chemical establishment in <LOCATION> Shikhany </LOCATION>, located on the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. The Soviets will visit the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at Porton Down, which sprawls across 7,000 acres on <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> plain near the ancient Stonehenge monument, about 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Since <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s stockpiles have been destroyed, Porton Down now does only defensive work, making protective equipment such as gas masks, clothing and monitoring instruments for the armed forces and developing antidotes to chemical weapons. The Soviets also will visit the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where applied microbiological research is conducted, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> Defense Nuclear Biological and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where instructors are trained to use defensive equipment to counter chemical weapons. In return, British scientists will in July visit the Soviet chemical warfare facility in <LOCATION> Shikhany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> proposed the exchange in 1986, before the Soviets acknowledged that they possess chemical weapons. In early 1987, the Soviets conceded they have a chemical weapons stockpile amounting to 50,000 tons and accepted the British invitation later that year. Western estimates, however, put the Soviet stockpile at 300,000 tons _ the largest in the world. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which has been in the forefront of negotiations to achieve a worldwide ban on chemical weapons, said last week that such a ban, as well as reductions in conventional forces, must come before any further negotiations on cutting nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the only other country that acknowledges possessing chemical weapons, ended an 18-year moratorium on their manufacture in December and has an estimated stockpile of 30,000 tons. The massive Soviet stockpile has been a major stumbling block at the 40-nation <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. A 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol bans the use of chemical arms.

Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An additional 3,375,367 acres of highly erodible cropland will be taken from production under the 10-year Conservation Reserve Program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of the department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Program, said the acreage was accepted from offers, or bids, during the program's sixth signup held Feb. 1-19. A total of about 4.5 million acres was offered during the signup. In all, counting the earlier signups, more than 25.5 million acres have been accepted into the program, he said. Another signup will be held July 18 through Aug. 5. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1985 farm law set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres for the program by 1990. Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for 10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, they get annual rental payments from the government and one-time assistance pay for half the cost of planting grass, trees and shrubs to guard against erosion. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said the bids accepted from the latest signup averaged $ 47.90 per acre annually, compared with $ 48.45 for the first five signups.

<HEAD>80,000 Peasants March on Half Dozen Colombian Cities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 80,000 peasants marched on a half dozen <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> cities Monday, demanding land, nationalization of foreign oil companies and an end to what they call the army's `` dirty war'' against them. The military said leftist guerrillas organized the protests. There have been 20 peasant marches in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the last year. This is the first time the protests were aimed at foreign oil companies. There are approximately 30 such companies here. Newspapers and radio chains with reporters accompanying the peasants estimated the total number of protesters as about 80,000. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital, troops occupied <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national university after the rector, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacio </PERSON>, said young people with guns organized protests that led to cars being stoned and to university property being destroyed. Peasants marched on the northern cities of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Valledupar </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION> in the east and on <LOCATION> Barrancabermeja </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. In another development, guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> threw a bomb and hijacked a bus in the northwest city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, police there reported. A police release said little damage was caused by the bomb explosion Sunday night at the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> headquarters of a banana plantation owners' association. Banana growers and banana pickers have been at odds for months. Right-wing death squads have killed 95 workers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, known as the <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, has killed 10 workers believed to be army informants. <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas hijacked a busload of workers in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Monday, but freed everyone and fled after harranguing the passengers, the police said. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON> said in an interview with the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that Monday's peasant protests were organized by the ELN. The <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION> demands that foreign oil companies get out of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and that the government nationalize their holdings. The guerrilla group has bombed the country's main oil pipeline two dozen times this year. The line runs 500 miles from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s biggest oil field, on the Venezuelan border in northern <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION> province, to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Covenas </LOCATION>. As in past protests, the peasants claimed that the army is behind death squads that have killed hundreds of people in the last two years. Death squads killed about 800 members of a leftist party, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, during that time. In the last two months, death squads killed more than 150 peasants, including those in the banana-growing regions, for alleged sympathy with leftist guerrillas.

 An armed hijacker commandeered a Colombian jetliner today and diverted it to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> then <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> after freeing 131 people, authorities said. Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yezid </PERSON> <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> said the hijacker was demanding $ 100,000. <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> said the man claimed to have a fatal disease and wanted to live out his days in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The plane landed at <LOCATION> Reina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beatrix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oranjestad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> this afternoon, said an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employee there. `` The plane is here at this moment,'' the employee said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There are police at the airport. No one is being allowed near the plane.'' <PERSON> Nilka </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergara </PERSON>, spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Omar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torrijos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, said the aircraft was fueled after a three-hour stop in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Airport administrator <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said the lone male hijacker carried two hand grenades and at least one pistol and was holding the pilot, co-pilot and a flight engineer hostage. There were no passengers on board. Speaking to reporters, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> called the man `` desquiciado'' _ <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> for mentally unbalanced _ and said a special negotiating team that talked with him on a ground-crew intercom could not learn his identity, nationality or what he wants. Castano initially said 135 people were let of the plane in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, but later revised the figure to 131 people, including three flight attendants. The hijacker forced the airliner's crew to cut off communications with the airport control tower after the plane landed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. But he said a three-man negotiating team walked up to the plane and spoke through the intercom. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said the negotiating team was made up of Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Siedlitz </PERSON>, chief of security at the airport; <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossi </PERSON>, director of all Panamanian airports; and Maj. <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of the Panamanian Defense Forces. He said a special <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> team was deployed around the plane. Soldiers could be seen in ditches about 80 yards from the jet. The Avianca jet took off from the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> this morning on a flight to <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, about 200 miles to the southeast, and was hijacked, the security chief of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> told the radio network <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Edgard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> told the radio in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> that the plane was forced back to <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where 129 passengers and six flight attendants were freed. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 then took off for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where it landed at the international airport outside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and taxiied to a stop on the grass next to an isolated runway.

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Exports to Soviet Union Expected To Rise Sharply This
Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year is expected to be at a three-year high of $ 1.4 billion, up 50 percent from $ 938 million in calendar 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` Behind the gain will be much larger wheat shipments at higher prices and much bigger soybean and soybean meal sales,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Farm product sales to the Soviets exceeded $ 1.9 billion in 1985 but plummeted to a 13-year-low of $ 658 million in 1986 before starting their rebound. A major factor has been large sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> value share of Soviet grain imports may be above 30 percent for the first time since 1984 and -LRB- may comprise -RRB- over 8 percent of total agricultural imports,'' the report said. Although total Soviet agricultural imports may increase 5 percent in 1988 from last year's estimated $ 16 billion, the value still will be below the $ 19 billion average during the first half of the 1980s. `` Grain imports now cost about $ 3 billion a year instead of $ 7 billion as in 1981-85,'' the report said. Despite a possible 20 percent rise in the per-ton cost of imported grain in 1988, this `` unit value'' will still be around one-third lower in the early 1980s. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecast 1988 Soviet grain output at 215 million metric tons, up 2 percent from last year. It also would be the third consecutive harvest of more than 200 millon tons, a historic first for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Crops are off to a much better start than in 1987 following a good fall sowing, overwintering and spring planting conditions,'' Monday's analysis said. `` Barring unusually severe weather through the spring and fall, 1988 crop output should increase.''

 It will take up to two months to complete the trial of a professor accused of the chain saw murder of a teen-age male prostitute whose body parts were scattered across the state, potential jurors were told Monday. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Franc </PERSON>, 58, who taught political science at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> but maintained an apartment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, has denied killing the 18-year-old runaway, blaming a man who has never been found. The trial is expected to offer insight into the plight of young runaways in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> gay community. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> told 70 prospective jurors Franc's trial could last as long as eight weeks. `` Some have referred to this as the chain saw case,'' the judge told the prospects and informed them that body parts had been found in various locations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He instructed them not to read anything further about the case. The victim, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was 18 when he died on Aug. 20. He had left home the previous February, telling his mother that he was headed for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to become a movie star. After his arrival, he bleached his dark hair blond and wore it in spikes. Counselors in the gay community said <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> turned to them for help after his dreams of stardom faded and he wound up working as a homosexual prostitute. Franc, a bespectacled professor originally from <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Pere </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was arrested Aug. 29 after he returned a chain saw to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> rental company with bits of flesh and blood in its inner workings. Police alleged that the saw was used to cut up <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>'s body, which was found in pieces scattered across a 200-mile area. Some parts of the body were never found. In early interviews with police, Franc claimed that <PERSON> Nute </PERSON> was murdered by another man, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, but no such person was ever located and a prosecutor contends the man was invented by Franc. If convicted, Franc could face life imprisonment.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has decided to allow an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas on loan from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> while zoo officials work to produce the required export papers, the service said Monday. Last week, the agency said the Toledo Zoo would not be allowed to display the pandas until it could provide the original export permit. The zoo, which has scheduled to open the panda exhibit Tuesday, was given 10 days to come up with the documentation. However, <ORGANIZATION> USFWS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said Monday that lawyers for the zoo gave the service a copy of the Chinese export permit over the weekend and appear to be making a good-faith effort to deliver the original document. `` We're not going to stand in the way of them opening their exhibit this week,'' <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said. `` They appear to be making an effort to deliver the documents. We'll accept that in good faith from them as a first step. We'll allow them to open as they want.'' However, <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said the zoo still will be required to provide the originals by May 29. Zoo officials have said they have a representative in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> working on getting the documents to the service. Zoo spokeswoman <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Napierala </PERSON> confirmed that the zoo had gotten the green light to open the exhibit and plans to do so at noon Tuesday. The zoo has spent nearly $ 3 million in preparing to exhibit the pandas as part of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s 150th anniversary celebration. In a bid to stop the exhibit, the World Wildlife Fund filed suit against the wildlife service, arguing that the exhibit would violate an international convention that bars trafficking in endangered species for commercial purposes. <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoo </PERSON> officials had sought unsuccessfully to be exempted from the convention on endangered species and had filed an exemption form with the service instead of the full export permit as required. When the pandas arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on May 13, the paperwork had not been corrected. <PERSON> Klinger </PERSON> said the service decided it would be best for the pandas to allow them to go on to <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and to take up the issue later.

 A coalition raising money for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' share of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> costs has picked up nearly $ 450,000 in less than two weeks, a fund-raiser said Monday `` More than $ 448,000 has been raised since May 11 in pledges and contributions,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. That means the city still has about $ 3.3 million to go in its effort to cover $ 5.5 million in estimated expenses for the GOP convention Aug. 15-18 in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome, he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> predicted the New Orleans Special Events Fund will have all but about $ 1 million by mid-July. Two weeks ago, the head of the money-raising effort, oilman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said the job was too big for one man and that donations were trickling in at a disappointing rate. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trail </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, then announced they would join the fund drive.

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and family members on Monday urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to allow mathematician <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> to emigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for medical resons. `` The reason they refuse to let him go is ludicrous,'' said <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Officially <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> is being denied emigration because of work he did 17 years ago on the Soviets' rocket re-entry system, she said. <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>, 50, has a serious heart condition which cardiologists in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> say make removal of two tumors on his neck and thyroid gland too risky, she said. Western physicians who examined <PERSON> Charny </PERSON> said the necessary surgery would be routine if conducted in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The tumor on <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>'s neck, which reportedly doubles in size every few months, is now 3.5 inches in diameter and threatens to block nerves and arteries to the brain, Mrs. <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON> said at a news conference. Noting the move to sign a U.S.-Soviet agreement on a joint mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> as `` a sign of trust,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON> said `` it is especially ridiculous under these circumstances to claim that my father's work is still secret.'' `` It looks as if the Soviets are planning to fly to Mars, together with the Americans but return separately, since they still consider the work of my father on the return -LRB- to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> -RRB- to be a secret,'' she said. `` I can not understand it,'' she said. `` My only hope is that with this coming summit, responding to all the indignation of people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and all over the world during the summit -LRB- that -RRB- my father's case will finally be resolved and this race against time will finally be over.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON>, who was allowed to emmigrate with her husband and daughter last fall, was joined at the news conference by Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> A group of children from nearby <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, presented part of 15,000 letters from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> schoolchildren and one signed by more than 100 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>'s behalf. Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had been supportive of <PERSON> Charny </PERSON>'s bid for emigration, but they noted the Soviets had the last word. `` It has been our experience that often they wo n't tell you a thing,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` But if you keep trying and you keep talking, it does have an effect.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON> met with the Soviet counsel general later Monday to discuss her father's case. Following the 30-minute meeting, Mrs. <PERSON> Charny-Blank </PERSON> said the general counsel `` told me he wished he did n't have to discuss these cases because it was not his decision -LRB- to make -RRB-, but he would send the information to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as soon as possible. `` He did n't say this, but I think the situation makes them uncomfortable,'' she said.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Effects New Extending Into Streams in Mid-Atlantic
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Acid rain probably has acidified a small number of streams in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states where surface waters previously had not been proven vulnerable, according to an unreleased study by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 in <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristics that made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from natural sources, the study concluded. On forested ridges inland from coastal lowlands, the proportion reached 10 percent. `` The lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in these streams makes it likely'' that their acidity is `` probably associated with atmospheric acid deposition,'' said the study made available by the agency on Monday. More than a quarter of the stream mileage showing these chemical characteristics in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s study of eastern streams was outside the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>, but most of that was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> where streams are often naturally acidic. There was practically no such mileage in the Southeast or the <LOCATION> Ozark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, head of acid rain research for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, said the new findings show there has been `` an expansion of the geographic area'' known to be influenced by acid rain. What the study could not show is definite proof that acid rain has acidified the streams in question, how fast stream acidity and acid-neutralizing ability is changing or when it is likely the watershed no longer will be able to neutralize the acidity naturally. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to be able to answer such questions next year. The <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> area in the study was made up of rural areas of most of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, all of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the eastern half of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. An acidic stream was defined as one that had lost all ability to neutralize further inputs of acidity. Some of the heaviest deposition of acidity in rain and snow was found in southern and southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, northeastern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> panhandle. These areas and their robust soils, believed to have plenty of ability to neutralize acid rain, have not attracted the attention of areas with somewhat less acidity in the rain but more vulnerable watersheds like parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Most of the acidity in rain, snow and fog in the area is believed to originate in emissions from smokestacks of coal-fired power plants in the area and also upwind in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Sulfur dioxide in the smokestack gases is transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid which is washed out in precipitation. The more acidic the water, the less fish life it can support, and too much acidity means no fish can live there _ what environmentalists say has happened in many lakes in the Northeast and eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. There are several sources of sulfates, and the sampling scheme excluded streams that were likely to have been influenced by sources in urban pollution or mine runoff. About one-third of the 4 percent of stream mileage in question `` had chemistry influenced but not dominated'' by organic compounds originating in the soil, and most of these stream segments were located in the Pine Barrens of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> or were headwaters of streams in the relatively flat glaciated soils of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Historic data suggests that streams in the Pine Barrens may have been naturally acidic at least since the early 1900s,'' the study said. `` There is no reason, however, to believe that most of the upland forested reaches have always been acidic.'' Overall, the study concluded that 2.7 percent of the stream mileage sampled was acidic, including 12 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> streams.

 American envoy <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue pushing for an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> unless it accepts a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to reporters before flying to <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, the fifth stop on a tour that also has taken him to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Omani officials would not comment on the purpose of the visit, saying only that it would last two days and they would discuss U.N.-related issues. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the ambassador praised the government's refusal to free convicted terrorists despite pressures that included the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet and the killing of two passengers. The release of 17 jailed terrorists convicted of bombing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in 1983 was the hijackers' only demand during the 16-day hijack last month. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> refused to free them and the hijackers surrendered the plane in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> in return for safe conduct. Release of the 17 also has been the main demand of pro-Iranian Shiite Mosleh ` fxtremists holding nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s emir, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>; Crown Prince <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON>, minister of state for Cabinet affairs. Asked whether he and the Kuwaitis discussed the hijacking and several terrorist bombings in the sheikdom, he said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thinks that the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government demonstrated great courage during the recent hijacking. `` We are not here to make a deal about terrorists and in no way will the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ever bring any kind of pressure on the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government,'' he said in reference to the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Asked about <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> measure of last July 20 calling for a truce in the Iran-Iraq war, which began in SeptMm | er 1980, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Resolution 598 was `` unanimously approved and it's binding on every member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will never abandon its support of 598 and will work ... and urge our friends to support a second resolution and an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'' if it does not accept the resolution, he said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said it will accept the resolution, but only if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be declared the aggressor before there can be a cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes.

 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Monday denied an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspaper report that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> helped develop surface-to-surface missiles that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sold to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The report in the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial sources and Saudi experts as saying Israeli scientists refined the guidance system used in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s medium-range CSS-2 missile. It became known two months ago that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had bought and deployed CSS-2s, which have a range of 2,200 miles and could reach any target in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> did not known of the deal in advance and could not persuade the Saudis to cancel it. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio: `` Israelis were never partners in... the transfer of technology or anything related to ground-to-ground missiles to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> If anyone ... is looking for an alibi about how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was taken by surprise by a friendly nation, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> ... and is trying to pin the blame on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, let him look elsewhere.'' Saudi leaders told the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they bought the missiles to defend themselves against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and pledged not to launch them at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In March, an aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> hinted that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might attack and destroy the missiles. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> do not have diplomatic relations but there have been reports of increasing agricultural and business links between the two nations. An Israeli newspaper said last July a joint company had been formed to help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with agricultural and technological projects.

 The federal judge who was gunned down at his suburban home had ignored warnings from his staff to take his address out of the phone book, telling them, `` It's fate. ... If they really want you, they'll find you.'' The seven-year sexual harassment and job discrimination suit of <PERSON> Carolee </PERSON> <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> came to District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> in his first year on the federal bench. After he ruled against her, her angered father tracked the judge down and killed him, and then killed himself a few feet away, officials said. The gunman was identified as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officer. `` I knew it was related to this case. It was just a feeling I had,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefflre </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>'s two law clerks, said Monday, describing her thoughts when she heard that the judge had been killed. `` I knew as soon as I heard. I knew,'' she said, fighting back tears during an interview with reporters in <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>'s chambers. `` The only thing that threw me off was that he -LRB- the gunman -RRB- killed himself.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stefflre </PERSON> said she and other members of the judge's staff urged him to remove his listing in the telephone directory, but he shrugged it off, saying, `` It's fate. You ca n't really hide. If they really want you, they'll find you.'' Another law clerk, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>, said the judge rode public transportation from <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>, the affluent <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community where he lived, to the federal courthouse in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` He would talk to anyone,'' said <PERSON> Forte </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, deputy assistant director in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said Sunday that <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> left a suicide note expressing `` strong displeasure'' at <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>'s ruling last Thursday dismissing <PERSON> Carolee </PERSON> <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>'s lawsuit. On Saturday afternoon, officials said, <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> shot the judge as <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> tended his garden and followed him into the house, where the judge died in his study and <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> killed himself with a shot to the head. Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, sued in 1981 claiming sexual harassment and salary discrimination by <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where she was employed in a management position, and her former boss, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. During the seven years of litigation, <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON>, appointed to the federal bench last June, was the third judge to handle the case. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON>, who represented Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> from 1983 to 1985, said lawyers for Chase and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> defended the case aggressively and numerous pretrial motions were filed by both sides. At least two changes of lawyers by Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> added to the delay, he said. <PERSON> Lippman </PERSON> said he withdrew from the case over strategy differences with Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, and she began to represent herself. She was communicating directly with the judge and other parties in the lawsuit, which `` made my job difficult to impossible,'' he said. He said she became impatient with him and the case became `` almost a vendetta against both the bank and Mr. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> ... almost a case of justifying her existence, all of the emotional torment that she had been through.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stefflre </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> twice turned down settlements _ once before trial and once after it started. Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> could not be located by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for comment Monday, and her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> phone number is unlisted, but the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported she said she had turned down a $ 300,000 settlement. `` I refused, but today I'm sorry I did n't say yes,'' she reportedly said. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitel </PERSON>, said, `` We wo n't have any comment on that It is not unusual in a situation where protracted litigation may result to discuss settlement.'' Ms. <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> told the newspaper her father believed the judge was biased against her. `` I still love my father,'' she said. `` I'm sorry about what happened, but I believe he thought he was doing something out of love, too.'' <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, a security guard from 1971 to 1981 at the <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> branch where his daughter worked, spent much of his life savings on the case, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` The <PERSON> Koster </PERSON> family was totally consumed with this case and it had become a crusade in their lives,'' <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opened the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Arab schools Monday for the first time in nearly four months and 200,000 youngsters returned to classes. Palestinian leaders called it a `` glorious victory.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments in the case of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civil disobedience who appealed a government order deporting him. Military officials said schools were opened because violence had declined, but three Palestinians were killed Sunday in one one of the worst days in recent weeks, and a new underground leaflet called a general strike for Wednesday. The army has `` examined'' the education system and `` teachers who were connected with the rioting are not teachers today,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Shaike </PERSON> <PERSON> Erez </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military administration, said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At least 194 Arabs have been killed, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowicz </PERSON>, spokesman for the military government, said 612 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> elementary schools and kindergartens were reopened Monday for 203,000 students and `` everything went really well. Over 90 percent of students and all the teachers showed up for classes.'' High schools will be reopened next week if conditions remain peaceful, he said. Authorities closed 1,200 schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> early in February, affecting about 475,000 Palestinian students. Schools in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> have operated sporadically since, but those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> remained closed. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, has been in jail since May 5. He said he will use whatever means necessary to return if he is deported _ including conversion to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, which would allow him to come back under a law that makes all Jews citizens of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and his lawyers say he can not be deported under Israeli law. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who spent 15 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Jerusaem </LOCATION> in 1985, is an American whose tourist visa has expired. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took steps to deport <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> after he urged Palestinians to use civil disobedience against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> claims that is not the reason for the order against him. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman, <PERSON> Muneira </PERSON> <PERSON> Safta </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON>, was charged with causing grevious bodily harm for allegedly hurling a stone at a Jewish settler who then shot an Israeli girl in the village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. According to the Israeli media, Miss <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> stoned <PERSON> Romam </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON> after he shot and killed her brother and another Arab. <PERSON> Aldubi </PERSON>, a soldier on leave who was guarding a group of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hikers, fired several bullets after being struck and accidentally killed the Israeli teen-ager, according to an army report. <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was the first Israeli to die in violence connected with the 5-month-long uprising. The government filed charges Monday against two Israeli editors of a pro-Palestinian newspaper, <PERSON> Derech </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanitzotz </PERSON>. It accused them of belonging to a terrorist group and having contacts with foreign agents. <PERSON> Roni </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Efrat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwartz </PERSON> could be sentenced to 40 years in prison each if convicted of association with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Shurie </PERSON>, head of a private college in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, noted that leaflets put out by leaders of the rebellion urged students to return to school. `` They think it is one of the aims of the ` intefadeh' -LRB- uprising -RRB- _ to be educated,'' he said. The leaflet circulating in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was the 17th issued by a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our glorious victory by going back to school proves our slogan that we learn in whatever circumstances,'' it said. It called for a one-day general strike Wednesday to mark 40 days since the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, at his home in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos killed <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, but the government has made no official comment.

<HEAD>TVA Investigates Second Nuclear Shutdown Since Sequoyah's Restart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN GEORGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investigative team is looking into what caused <ORGANIZATION> Sequoyah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>'s balky Unit 2 reactor to shut down Monday for the second time in 3 -LCB- days. The reactor automatically shut down at 12:28 a.m. Monday because of an instrument problem in its reactor coolant system, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION>'s assistant manager of nuclear power. <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> described the incident at the twin-reactor plant outside <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> as minor and said it represented no danger to plant employees or the public. The shutdown was the second at <LOCATION> Sequoyah </LOCATION> since May 13, when Unit 2 became <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s first reactor to go back on line since the federal utility shut down its nuclear program in August 1985 because of safety concerns. Unit 2 was approaching 75 percent power at the time of Monday's shutdown _ about the same level it had reached on May 19 when a water gauge problem caused the reactor to automatically power down `` It was a relatively minor instrumentation problem that we can correct,'' said <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a plant spokeswoman. `` As we've said repeatedly, because of the complexity of any nuclear plant, it's not uncommon for a unit to automatically shut down. The reactor had restarted Saturday after repairs and adjustments, and plant workers were calibrating a transmitter that provides readings on reactor water flow when Monday's shutdown occurred. `` The plant's investigative team will be evaluating the cause of the shutdown,'' <PERSON> Bynum </PERSON> said. `` The transmitters will be recalibrated and Unit 2 will be returned to safe operation when all activities are completed.''

 An American free-lance journalist was arrested and expelled from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. A Nicaraguan official said the man entered a restricted military zone with fake identification documents. The source at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> identified the man as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 38. He said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was working for a conservative group and was arrested on Wednesday, May 18, at <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlas </PERSON>, a military zone on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. He was deported to neighboring <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> either late Friday or Saturday. He said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> `` entered military bases illegally. He also falsified an accreditation from the presidency's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.'' When in custody, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> which cooperates with the U.S.-supported rebel umbrella group called the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was also found to be carrying a letter of recommendation from <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, a leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the source said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Sunday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, that he was 38 years old, was from <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and had worked for the Atlanta Constitution and the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in a warning to the financial planning industry, said Monday it was suspending a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> investment adviser for failing to tell clients she was earning commissions on the securities she recommended. Without admitting or denying guilt, <PERSON> Nida </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, agreed to accept an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> censure and a 120-day suspension from working as an investment adviser or securities broker. In what <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said was a ground-breaking case, the commission found that beginning in June 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, who was president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> chapter of a national organization of financial planners, violated federal laws by failing to tell clients she would receive a commission when they bought into limited real estate partnerships she was selling. She also failed to tell customers they did not have to go through her to purchase the investment, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said, and some of the clients were not suited for investments of that level of sophistication and risk. Officials said it was one of the first cases brought against an investment adviser who is also registered as a securities broker. `` It is very important that when investment advisers are wearing these various hats that they have to bear in mind they have a fiduciary responsibility to their client,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> assistant regional administrator in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> division of investment management, said, `` Consumers seem to approach financial planners as trusted advisers and financial planners seem to market their services in that light: ` You can come in to us and you do n't have to worry about those brokers or insurance agents who are trying to sell you something.' `` However, many of them, if not most of them, are in fact just like the broker or the insurance agent that's trying to sell something,'' she said. `` We're saying they just have to make that clear to the consumer so they can evaluate the advice with a grain of salt. `` The action we brought hopefully will tell other financial planners: We're dead serious. These are rules you're subject to and you have to comply or else,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone messages left Monday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. A woman answering the telephone at the office said no officers of the firm were available to discuss the case. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Covington </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, would not comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> order but said the association investigates complaints against any of its 24,000 members and would reprimand or expel a member when justified. <PERSON> Covington </PERSON> said many investment advisers work only for fees, much as a lawyer or accountant, and accept no commissions on securities they sell, while others are paid both. `` Life is full of conflicts of interest and it is not necessarily nasty to sell something you're recommending, provided you make the proper disclosure,'' he said. Investment advising is a fast-growing field. About 12,000 firms are registered with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> as advisers.

 The Danish movie `` Pelle the Conqueror'' won the Golden Palm award Monday night as the best film of the 41st <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Lords Kill Attempt to Alter Thatcher Tax Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> gave Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> an important victory Monday, killing an attempt by rebels in her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to amend tax legislation. The unelected upper chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted 317-183 against an amendment that would have mandated a closer link to a person's ability to pay It was the largest turnout in the Lords since 1971. Although the Lords and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> still may consider other amendments, the government's victory ensures passage of the major principles of the tax legislation, which was nearly defeated by a Commons revolt in April. Lord <PERSON> Chelwood </PERSON>, leader of the rebellion in the Lords, said during debate on his amendment that the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government proposals `` are a lot less fair'' than the current system. `` They have very little support,'' said <PERSON> Chelwood </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> member of the Commons. `` They are extremely unpopular in the country.'' He condemned suggestions by some peers that the chamber had no right to challenge legislation passed by the Commons. The Lords does not have the power to interfere with taxation, but some lords said it was not clear whether the poll tax was an issue of taxation or local authority. `` We are a revising chamber, seeking to exercise restraint on the otherwise unfettered power of the Commons,'' <PERSON> Chelwood </PERSON> said. `` If we can not ` tamper' with legislation, we really have nothing to do.'' Under the so-called poll tax, which critics say is unfair to the poor, property taxes are levied on each adult rather than on houses or apartments. Although the poor will get rebates, they must pay a tax of at least 5 percent. The legislation, a clause in the bill on local government finances, is central to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s legislative program for curbing expenditures by local councils, most of which are controlled by the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In the Lords on Monday, many peers echoed government assertions that people would be less likely to elect free-spending councils if they felt the pinch of the local tax bill. A rebel amendment was defeated 320-295 a month ago in the Commons, where the Conservatives have a majority of 101.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday easily rejected three new Republican challenges to the medium-range missile treaty and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said `` it would be an embarrassment'' to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if the pact is n't ratified before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> told his colleagues, `` the ball is in our court, the Republicans' court'' as the Democratic-controlled chamber began a second week of work on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Later, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and urged approval of the pact before the summit. `` Here is a treaty that has been examined in more detail than any arms control treaty in history, by far,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after the Capitol Hill session. `` There is a time to inquire and there is also a time to vote. ... It would be a good thing to have it.'' The first decision came when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 81-13 to kill an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. It would have prevented the treaty from taking effect until <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reassures <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the accuracy of the number of triple-warhead Soviet SS-20 missiles which will be destroyed. Later, the chamber killed, on a 68-26 vote, an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., that would have required a change in the treaty's text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that would have permitted construction of some Soviet missiles Then, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected, 81-5, an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, that would have delayed the INF pact until the two nations agreed on a more far-reaching pact providing 50 percent cuts in each side's large arsenals of long-range atomic weapons. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said, `` We ought to wait until we see the whole picture'' before approving any pact, but critics termed it a `` killer amendment'' designed to derail the treaty. Before the votes, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told his colleagues again the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should approve the pact before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from May 29 to June 2. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> and other conservatives have blocked action by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, delaying the ratification that even critics say is assured. Ratification requires a two-thirds majority voting in favor. `` I'm still convinced it would be an embarrassment to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to sit down with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> later this week without the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have taken action to consent to ratification of the treaty,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. However, he added, `` We have some serious issues that, in some cases, may take several hours or days.'' The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, requires destruction within three years of all atomic missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. For the Soviets, that includes 400 deployed SS-20s and another 250 stockpiled SS-20s. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accepted the Soviet statement of 650 SS-20s, even though <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> analysts say the Soviets may be hiding more than 250 of the weapons. `` We were snookered,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` The estimates are that the Soviets have 300 to 600 more than the 650 thy admit to having.'' `` This is a gut issue,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. `` It could mean the difference between survival and destruction for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or a good part of it.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have rejected <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' claim, although <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> conceded it is difficult to prove that no SS-20s are hidden `` It is akin to proving the <ORGANIZATION> Loch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ness </ORGANIZATION> monster does n't exist,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that even if SS-20s are hidden, they could not be deployed without violating the treaty and their `` viability would degrade quickly'' without testing <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment `` is not needed, it is unnecessary and it would hamper our efforts to get the INF treaty in place,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. Wallop's proposal affected a part of the treaty which, he said, was written in such a way as to permit production of Soviet SS-25 missiles that would be interchangeable with stages in the SS-20. The SS-25 is not banned. `` This amendment just is to make certain that we do what we set out to do,'' <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> said, explaining that he wanted to make sure that no SS-25s were produced that would be interchangeable with the SS-20. Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed with Wallop that the treaty's language `` is awkwardly written.'' But <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said the amendment was n't needed because if the Soviets produce SS-25 stages which are interchangeable with the SS-20, they would be in violation of the pact. Among the issues remaining to be settled is an amendment, backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority, which would require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval before any future administration could change how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interprets the INF pact. That amendment is the result of a fight between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Democrats over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile pact. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserts that his administration unilaterally can change how the treaty is interpreted, a view disputed by congressional Democrats. The amendment banning any INF reinterpretation was added by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> over the opposition of Republicans. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said Monday the treaty `` should be nailed It should n't be subject to reinterpretation.'' He said, `` I'm certainly not interested in any erosion of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional role in treaty making. ... I do n't propose to give the store away.''

 A man who says he was raised to be a racist pleaded innocent Monday to a federal charge of threatening to kill black Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, was accused in an indictment last week of threatening <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life. The indictment also accused him and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, 27, of possessing an unregistered automatic rifle and threatening and intimidating a government informant. At their arraignment before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> pleaded innocent to the charges, but said nothing in their own behalf. In response to questions to determine their competency, both told the judge they do not have mental problems and do not abuse alcohol or drugs. They and their lawyers declined comment following the court appearance. <PERSON> Filippine </PERSON> gave lawyers on both sides 11 days to file post-arraignment motions. The judge set a trial date of July 18. The Williamses were arrested May 13 at their apartment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. They had lived there about a year since moving from a farm in the Ozark hills of southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said initially that evidence _ including a secretly recorded conversation between <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the informant _ indicated that a white supremacist organization called the Covenant, Sword and the Arm of the Lord was conspiring to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> June 21 or July 4. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was targeted because he was `` getting too close to being president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The government's complaint, which preceded Thursday's indictment, cited a loaded AR-15 rifle that, with help from an informant, was found by sheriff's deputies in a wooded area of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Near the rifle was a bag containing a post card addressed to <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and maps, one of which bore his fingerprints, the complaint said. Authorities charged the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> with threatening the informant during a meeting on May 11. The indictment made no mention of white supremacists or a conspiracy. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has said that it has been unable to find any evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> belonged to CSA or any other white supremacist organization. Since their arrests, the <ORGANIZATION> Williamses </ORGANIZATION> have denied that they are members of such groups. <PERSON> Londell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also has denied, in media interviews, having planned to kill <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has said, however, that he has `` prejudices ... against anything that is n't white.'' `` That's how I've been raised,'' he said.

 In the era of `` glasnost,'' a sentence to years of hard labor in a Soviet prison camp is not the automatic response to dissent. Greater debate on some topics is allowed. But there are still limits.

The government ordered the one-day shutdown for <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and the surrounding area, except for hospitals and other essential services, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Some stores opened, along with banks and <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> operated normally. It is near a geological fault on the south side of the city, the epicenter of the quakes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said at least 50 tremors measuring from 2.1 to 4.0 on the open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale had shaken the capital since midnight Friday. Many people living near the fault zone have been sleeping outside their homes. A few old walls cracked but no major damage was reported, according to news reports. On Feb. 4, 1976, an earthquake measuring 6 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale devastated <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and killed more than 22,000 people. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake registering 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. One of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage. Communications Minister <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> described the forced shutdown Monday as a precaution `` because of the situation caused by the constant and continuous earthquakes.'' He said the decision was made `` to avoid any -LRB- traffic -RRB- congestion and so that families can be together in their homes.''

 The first non-experimental aircraft that flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the spotlight Monday, hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators and top military brass. The V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and hovers like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, received a standing ovation from a crowd of 1,600. The crowd watched as the camouflaged craft was towed onto the tarmac at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> The first flight of the V-22, which has been in development for 30 years, is scheduled for Aug. 15. An advanced experimental model, the XV-15, has been flying since 1977. Fort Worth-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> are jointly developing the V-22 for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The three services plan to buy 682 of the twin-engine aircraft at an estimated cost of $ 16.6 million each. `` It's kind of awesome,'' <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the crowd. `` It works, it's ahead of schedule and will be a sound investment for taxpayers' money,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, comparing the tilt-rotor's production to the jet engine's development as aviation milestones `` You are proving every day that a great country can still outthink, out-design and out-produce all comers,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. The three military services plan to use the V-22 for combat assault, search and rescue, medical evacuation and special-forces missions. Other uses, including anti-submarine warfare, also are being studied. The cabin can carry 24 combat-equipped troops in addition to a crew of three. `` On our abortive rescue attempt made in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a few years ago, think what could have happened if they'd had an Osprey,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44 American hostages from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Osprey, about the size of a medium transport aircraft, has a stocky 57.3-foot-long fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick, stubby wings. Its engines point upward during takeoff and landing, with 38-foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground. The engines rotate, or `` tilt,'' forward once the V-22 is airborne. Rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers, pulling the Osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft. The tilt-rotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop plane _ more than 360 mph _ but does n't require an airport or runway. It also can hover like a helicopter. `` I'm convinced that in the next 20 years there will be thousands of these in use,'' said Bell President L.M. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> has talked with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and several commuter companies about civilian uses for the craft, a spokesman said. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> is a strong supporter of this concept,'' said <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. `` We could build a lot of V-22s for the cost of one airport. The British-designed Harrier jump-jet also takes off and lands vertically, but using jet-propulsion rather than a rotor system.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> called it `` out of the question'' for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to join any military force sent into the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> slums to end 18 days of fighting between Shiite Moslem factions, Lebanese officials reported Monday. They said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s rejection of an Iranian proposal to join such a force was conveyed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, at a six-hour meeting with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON>, that ended at dawn Monday Mortar and howitzer fire pounded the 16 square miles of tin-roofed shanties and narrow alleyways Monday, killing 13 people and wounding 78, police said. In east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s Phalange fighters and men of the main Christian militia Lebanese Forces fought with machine guns and hand grenades Monday night for control of the capital's Christian sector. Police said five combatants were wounded in the Sin el-Fil district, including at least one Phalangist and two from the Lebanese Forces. They said fighting began after Lebanese Forces gunmen wounded <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahhaleh </PERSON>, Phalangist commander in the district, and that it abated at about 11 p.m. Representatives of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian Amal militia also attended the overnight meeting between <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Monday's casualties raised the toll to 279 killed and 951 wounded since battles for control of the slums broke out May 6 between <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>. The Lebanese officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dispute over who would serve in a military force in the slums again delayed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s plans to try to end the fighting. Most of the 18 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans, are believed held by Hezbollah-affiliated kidnappers in the embattled enclave. Two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> dailies, the independent An-Nahar and leftist As-Safir, reported that <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> representatives insisted that the Syrian army take charge of security in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, endorsed the demand. `` There is no other alternative. The Syrian army has to go in to stop the bloodletting and end the plight of the population,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a statement. An-Nahar quoted the Iranian deputy foreign minister as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would approve a Syrian military intervention in the slums only if the hostage situation was resolved `` in a way that serves the objective for which they were kidnapped.'' <PERSON> Sheikholeslam </PERSON> did not elaborate, but <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> quoted him as saying the hostages were a `` vital issue for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also demanded guarantees that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> will be free to continue political activity in the slums after the Syrian deployment. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has kept massed around the slums about 7,500 troops, 100 tanks and 400 armored vehicles since <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> overran Amal strongholds to seize control of 90 percent of the urban battleground. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main Arab ally in the 7 -LCB- - year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, long a rival of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> politics But <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s move to dominate <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites has strained that alliance. The Syrians consider neighboring <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to be vital to their security. Amal spokesmen have complained that delaying Syrian deployment will only prolong suffering of thousands of civilians trapped in the slums. Police have said about 70 percent of the slums' estimated 250,000 residents have fled to safer areas.

 Corporate leaders and three of the nation's most popular musical groups on Monday announced a drive to encourage <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youth to prepare themselves for a future in the workforce `` This is a long-term commitment,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, told a new conference. `` This is a very competitive world. We need every single young person to be educated, to be available, to want to work and to be productive.'' Noting that youth unemployment was triple adult unemployment, <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said there were thousands of young people who could benefit from job training but were not getting the proper information. Each year's school dropouts cost the nation $ 240 billion in lost income and productivity over their lifetimes, he said, adding that the figure `` does n't even begin to take in the costs due to drugs and alcohol abuse, to crime, to simple human misery and despair.'' The program, involving <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON>'s group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's job training system, will use the popularity of musical groups <ORGANIZATION> Aerosmith </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> and Run-DMC to promote the message of `` Work Works.'' `` When these kids wo n't listen to us, they will listen to them. We are determined to make a dent in this problem,'' <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said. He said that Run-DMC alone `` will play to more than one million people at their concerts this summer _ and if we can reach a fraction of them with the message that work works and that jobs and skills training is available, then we can make a difference.'' Each of the rock groups will record public service announcements, appear in press conferences with officials in cities on their tour and donate job information booths at each of their concert sites, where members of the audience can apply for jobs and training, <PERSON> Kolberg </PERSON> said. Also at the news conference were the three members of Run-DMC _ <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> -LRB- Run -RRB-, <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON> -LRB- DMC -RRB- and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON> -LRB- Jam Master <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> -RRB-. The group also has been active in the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-drug promotion, raising money for famine relief in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Special Olympics and talking to teens about gangs and the need for education. `` We do n't want to preach. We can only set an example by being involved with a program like this,'' said <PERSON> McDaniels </PERSON>. `` We've been telling them to ` Say no to drugs' and other things. We want them to say ` yes' to staying in school and being a success at anything they want to do.''

<TEXT>
 A man `` who made greed his god'' was convicted Monday of kidnapping and murdering a prominent businessman who was buried alive and suffocated in a botched $ 1 million ransom scheme. Jurors deliberated only about an hour following a week-long trial before finding <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 31, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON> guilty of murdering <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> stood quietly and showed no emotion as the verdict was read in the courtroom of <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michela </PERSON>. A second phase of the trial will determine whether <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is sentenced to death. Small, 40, was the great-grandson of former Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> and was a member of a family with major media holdings. He was the former vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a group that owned radio and cable television stations, before the company was was sold in 1986. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' live-in girlfriend, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rish </PERSON>, 26, also was charged in the scheme and is awaiting trial. Earlier Monday, prosecutors said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> planned Small's kidnapping because he craved money <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was `` a man who made greed his god,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowicki </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general. `` All <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> boy had to do to cash in on that jackpot was put <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> ... in a box,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON>, another assistant <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general, slamming his hand on the top of the coffin-sized crate in which Small died. `` I never saw anybody come out of a grave. You bury people who are dead in a grave,'' <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, argued that Small was buried with candy bars, lights, and water and had n't been harmed before being put in the box. He said a faulty air supply system caused Small's death. `` It's an accident but it's not an intentional murder,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who suggested someone else abducted Small. `` I know you want to convict somebody, but certainly not for murder.'' Small was lured from his restored Victorian home with a telephone call after midnight Sept. 2, 1987. His family received clear instructions for delivering the ransom. Two days later, police found Small's body in the box, buried under 3 feet of sand 13 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION>. The jury, picked in northern Illinois' <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because of publicity the case received locally, heard a tape of Small's voice relaying the ransom demand to his family, and heard witnesses who saw <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> building the box Perhaps the most chilling evidence was the tape-recorded voice of Small on the telephone, telling his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>: `` It's no joke. I'm inside ... a box. Grave.'' `` It's under a couple of feet of sand or something, like underground,'' Small told his wife. `` I want you to get $ 1 million. God only knows how you're going to do that. He says there's 48 hours of air for me.'' Prosecutors called the tapes the voice from the grave. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, however, told jurors that no one had identified the voice on the ransom tapes as <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' voice, and said `` the facts do n't tell you'' that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was the kidnapper. Throughout the trial, the box was on display in the courtroom. `` Take a good long look,'' said <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' greed for the big score drove those nails, dug that grave and buried <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> alive.''

<TEXT>
 Italian-born <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Succo </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most wanted criminals as a multiple killer and a robber, was found dead in his prison cell Monday in an apparent suicide. <PERSON> Succo </PERSON>, 26, who was accused in a string of murders and robberies in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, was discovered with his head in a plastic bag, said <ORGANIZATION> Vicenza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Piernicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvis </PERSON>. A magistrate was investigating the death, <PERSON> Silvis </PERSON> said. Last week, an Italian judge declared Succo mentally incapable of understanding or taking part in his defense. The judge referred to psychologists who found <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> schizophrenic and a danger to society. <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> was arrested Feb. 28 near <LOCATION> Treviso </LOCATION>, his native town in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on charges of illegal possession of a gun and using false documents. Two days later, he bolted from his guards in the courtyard of the <LOCATION> Treviso </LOCATION> jail and climbed on the roof. He stripped to his underwear and hurled bricks at cars before he fell after dangling from a roof cable. Succo, slightly injured, was transferred to the more secure jail in <LOCATION> Vicenza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> escaped in May 1986 while on furlough from a psychiatric prison in <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emilia </LOCATION>, where he was held after killing his mother and father in 1981. He fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he was accused of killing two policemen, a doctor and two women. <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> was charged in the January 1988 slaying of police inspector <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morandin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toulon </LOCATION>, where he had lived for a year among prostitutes and sailors and was known as `` Andre.'' He was also charged with killing a police official, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Chambery </LOCATION> in April 1987. Other victims included a doctor in <LOCATION> Aix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> les </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bains </LOCATION> and two women near d'Annecy, all killed in 1987. After <PERSON> Morandin </PERSON>'s slaying, <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> escaped to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where he was accused of armed robbery and hostage-taking. Police said that when he was arrested after coming to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, he <LOCATION> Treviso </LOCATION>. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Succo </PERSON> was traveling in a stolen car. In the car, police found a handgun allegedly used in the slaying of one of the French policemen. Both <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> approached <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> about possible extradition, but no decision had been announced.

<TEXT>
 The defense in the Iran-Contra case sought a court order Monday to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has the final say over whether to proceed with the prosecution of the case. Lawyers for fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants sought a ruling that the attorney general has the sole authority to determine whether use of sensitive documents to prosecute the case would jeopardize national security. Under the Classified Information Procedures Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the government can decide that disclosure of secrets in a criminal trial would so jeopardize national security that the case should be dropped. The defense sought to disqualify independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> from making that determinion under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>, which was invoked because the Iran-Contra conspiracy case involves an unprecedented volume of highly secret government documents. Any determination to proceed with prosecuting the case `` will profoundly affect this country's national defense and its foreign relations,'' the defense said in a joint filing with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` A blunder by the IC -LRB- independent counsel -RRB- may well result in serious ruptures with our closest allies; in the loss of vital secrets to our enemies; and in the deaths of innocent persons of whom the IC does not even have knowledge,'' the defense said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has entrusted the delicate balancing that <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> requires to the attorney general, and did so with utmost clarity, precisely to avoid such disasters,'' lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said in the brief. The four are accused of conspiring to defraud the government by diverting profits from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Nicaraguan rebels when direct American military aid to the Contras was banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In a May 13 filing, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he had authority to decide decide whether to seek declassification of the large volume of secret documents that would be needed to try the case. Such authority was derived from the independent counsel statute and the parallel appointment he received from the attorney general to prosecute the case, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. But the independent counsel conceded that he `` must be deferential to the executive's determination as to whether national security concerns prevent public disclosure of validly classified information.'' In the final analysis, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> reluctantly conceded that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have the final say. `` It is the inherent function of the executive branch to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national security information to the extent necessary to permit the government to conduct the foreign affairs and national defense activities effectively,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> had said. The defense said it wanted the order to disqualify the independent counsel's office becuse its `` vague promise to pay ` deference' to the executive branch in exercising the attorney general's responsibilities under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> can not mask its attempt to seize power over national security in single-minded pursuit of its own interests.'' More than 200,000 pages of classified government documents were collected by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> during his investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said some 50,000 are relevant to the case and 5 percent to 10 percent of the total contain highly sensitive information that could jeopardize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations. Only the government agencies that classified the documents in the first place have the power to declassify the material so it can be used in court as evidence. The judge can delete classified text from a document or substitute a statement of facts to show what the document would prove if it were introduced as evidence. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has indicated an unwillingness to spend much time poring over secret material to prepare sanitized versions for a jury. No date for the trial has been set.

 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began protest actions Monday after complaining that preliminary results were rigged in a special mayoral election in the northern steel-producing city of <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION>. The party _ known as the PAN _ planned protest meetings this week in <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION> and other cities throughout the northern border state of <LOCATION> Coahuila </LOCATION> state to pressure the state legislature to reject the figures, said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, the PAN president in <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION>. A special election commission said over the weekend that <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON>, candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, won the May 8 election by 294 votes. More than 23,000 ballots were cast. The state legislature has not certified the results. The PAN says its candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Paez </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcon </PERSON>, won by 448 votes. It says it has copies of all the voting results and can prove that the figures from seven precincts were altered. `` Because of this intent of fraud, the PAN is calling on its supporters to carry out legitimate protests,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said by telephone Monday. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, PAN's presidential candidate in July 6 general elections, broke off campaigning in northern <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> state to head Monday for <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> will announce `` civil disobedience tactics'' at a rally there. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said PAN supporters already were marching in protest near the international bridges at <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Acuna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Piedras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negras </LOCATION>, just south of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won the <LOCATION> Coahuila </LOCATION> gubernatorial race and 37 of the 38 mayoralties at stake in regular elections on Oct. 25, 1987. But the state legislature, citing voting irregularities and violence, annulled the <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION> elections and set special elections for May 8. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and the PAN have fought for nine years for control of <LOCATION> Monclova </LOCATION>, a city of 300,000 people about 200 miles south of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border at <LOCATION> Eagle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. Its most recent administration was controlled by a bilateral commission, appointed after neither party could prove it won the 1984 mayoral race.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> unveiled a five-year budget plan that would raise taxes on the rich, freeze defense spending and increase support for social programs on Monday. He dismissed Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' earlier proposals as `` radically conservative.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential front-runner, defended his spending priorities, saying they do `` represent a fundamental change.'' And he indirectly criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for trying to map out specific expenses so far in advance. `` There's no way you can prepare a budget today for 1989,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after an appearance at a child care center in <LOCATION> Cranford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor spent most of Monday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, leaving the campaign trail to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made sure they were n't forgotten, attacking the budget policies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and complaining that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposed changes were too timid `` We can not be fooled into thinking the Reagan-Bush deficits make social justice impossible,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget reduces the deficit and funds needed investments. This is a budget for a strong and secure America.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also made an appearance at a day care center and the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, the object of a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area voters' referendum seeking to shut it down permanently, as he campaigned for his share of the 314 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> delegates up for grabs in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s June 7 presidential primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew some boos from the Rancho Seco plant workers when he told them the nuclear power industry is `` a dangerous job option.'' His five-year federal budget plan would increase taxes on the wealthy by $ 244 billion and on corporations by $ 104 billion, cut defense spending by $ 164 billion by imposing a five-year freeze on projected spending hikes and increase spending on social programs by $ 344 billion. He said it would also cut the nation's deficit from a projected $ 134 billion in 1993 to $ 49 billion. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeatedly contrasted his budget proposals with those of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, which he characterized as inadequate to reverse the Republican priorities set over the past eight years by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has cut investment in health care, housing, legal services, day care, scholarships by more than $ 100 billion. Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rails against that as being wrong, but offers to offset it by only $ 775 million,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` That is radically conservative, away from the dreams and aspirations of most Democrats. Unless there is a commitment to economic justice and change, he will find himself taken adrift to sea by the Democratic constituents. Instead of leading them, he will be on a raft without a rudder,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Our commitment is not to make bland beautiful. It's new directions,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' issues director, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was unfairly criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plans for spending $ 775 million _ $ 500 million on the Fund to <ORGANIZATION> Rebuild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, $ 250 million on a teacher excellence program and $ 25 million on a literacy Corps. `` The way to make critical new investments in a time of triple-digit deficits is not to make unrealistic promises about massive new spending,'' <PERSON> Edley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We have to think of creative ways to use modest federal resources to pull in private and state and local funds.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, repeating a campaign theme, said he would raise up to $ 58 billion a year for social programs such as housing, education and health care by freezing the military budget at its current $ 300 billion level for the next five years. `` My plan allows for a significant new social investment, including doubling of the education budget by 1993, a new national housing initiative, and an additional $ 3 billion per year for the war on drugs. These investments and deficit reduction are made possible by a combination of fair taxes on the wealthy and corporations and a freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending for five years,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I am for a strong defense. I also support a sound approach to the military budget. Our plan would freeze military spending,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Cost overruns ... two additional aircraft carrier task forces, <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> and the Midgetman do not make us stronger. They undermine our economy and make us weaker. Even after the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> cuts, real military spending will be 25 percent higher in 1993 than in 1980,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also opposes the two additional aircraft carrier task forces and the Midgetman missile system, and would cut back the Star Wars nuclear defense program to 1983 levels. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has called for a `` stable'' overall defense budget, with increases in conventional forces coming from cuts in strategic systems. The biggest tax increase in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s budget plan would restore the top 38.5 percent income tax rate. `` It's just the top 600,000 taxpayers who earn $ 200,000 and above, who will return from 28 percent to 38.5 percent. They can afford it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Other revenue measures would increase the minimum tax rate on corporations, impose a 0.5 percent securities transfer excise tax to raise $ 10 billion annual revenue and discourage major corporate mergers and takeovers, limit deductions for business meals to 50 percent, and impose a $ 7-billion-a-year `` polluters tax'' on corporations. Among his proposed `` new investments'' are programs which by 1993 would spend an extra $ 20 billion annually on education and job training, $ 17 billion on housing programs, $ 12 billion on health and nutrition programs and $ 3 billion more annually on AIDS programs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s budget proposals also include $ 5 billion more in transportation funding, $ 4.5 billion for scientific research in non-military fields, $ 1.7 billion annually on environmental programs, and $ 1 billion more annually for international economic assistance.

 Slain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daronco </PERSON> earlier in his career issued a landmark divorce ruling and presided over two highly publicized murder trials.

 Fire broke out Monday night on a Sealink freight ferry with 75 people aboard in the English Channel, and one person was reported missing and another injured, said the coast guard in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. The ferry, the 5,088-ton Seafreight Freeway, told the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> at Cap Gris Nez that the blaze was under control, the British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. However, there was concern among nearby rescue craft since the ferry was reportedly carrying dangerous cargo, it said. No further information was available on the dangerous cargo report. A <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> coast guard spokeswoman said the ferry, sailing from <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, carried 43 passengers and 32 crew. It was about 28 miles off <ORGANIZATION> Ramsgate </ORGANIZATION> on the southeast tip of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. Sealink recently restored channel service after a walkout by seamen supporting the continuing strike against P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Staff at hospitals in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION> went on alert Police said all power on the ship had been lost and the rescue was taking place in darkness. The blaze was believed to have broken out in the engine room of the ferry about two hours after it sailed out of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> at 7:30 p.m. -LRB- 2:30 p.m. EDT -RRB- bound for <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. A truck driver and a crew member were originally reported missing but the driver was later accounted for, it added. Helicopter pilot <PERSON> Jonathon </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> Wessex </ORGANIZATION> helicopter from <LOCATION> Manston </LOCATION> was the first on the scene and its crew airlifted a badly burned seaman straight to the Kent and <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A Sea King helicopter from Coltishall flew firemen with breathing apparatus out to the ferry and was quickly joined by a third helicopter, this time from <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> on Solent. Belgian helicopters stood by in <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION> to airlift passengers and crew from the ship if asked, but there were no plans for such an operation. <ORGANIZATION> Ramsgate </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> lifeboats were launched, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said. The Pride of Kent, a P and O ferry, was also reported on the way. On March 6, 1987, 193 people died when the British channel ferry <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> capsized in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>. Water poured through the bow doors, which had been left open as the vessel pulled out of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION>. The Seafreight Freeway ferry, built in 1981 and capable of carrying around 70 trucks, has been on charter to Sealink since mid-1986, operating between <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>. `` Information is a bit sketchy at the moment because the ship's radio is tied up with emergency messages,'' Sealink spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said `` The urgent thing is to ensure that the drivers and the crew are not in danger.''

 A heavily traveled bridge near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is believed to contain the first pair of peregrine falcons discovered nesting along the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in three decades, an animal expert said Monday. The falcons' behavior indicates they are tending to nestlings in a box placed by conservationists in a tower of the Tappan Zee Bridge along the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thruway </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mildner </PERSON>, curator of Museum of the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cornwall-on-Hudson </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have been trying since 1974 to reestablish peregrine falcons by releasing more than 160 young peregrines raised in captivity in the hopes they will mate. Conservationists know of at least 10 mating pairs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, including two pairs on other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bridges. <PERSON> Mildner </PERSON> said people and pesticides have disturbed the peregrines' traditional nesting areas in cliffs above the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, but that nesting perches in bridges afford a clifflike environment.

 Patience is the key to working with legendary actress <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, whose unexpected comings and goings on the set of the film `` Wicked Stepmother'' have created a stir, says the movie's producer-director. `` She's 80 and you have to be patient with her because you do get a great performance and it is <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Everything's amicable.

Miss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> just as filming was beginning on `` Wicked Stepmother.'' Besides, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said of the stir caused by her departure, `` Any publicity is good publicity.'' `` It was basically a health problem. If you're not feeling well and things are bothering you _ like dental problems _ it's hard to work. Now that that's been taken care of, she's coming back.''

 A man described as mentally unstable hijacked a Colombian jet with 135 people aboard Monday and forced it to fly to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> after letting the passengers off. The plane later returned to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> where the man vanished. The captain of the Avianca airlines <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 said the hijacker apparently jumped off the plane as it was rolling toward the terminal Monday night at the international airport in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Carribbean </LOCATION> coast. The plane was hijacked on a domestic flight Monday morning after it took off from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> in northwest <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. It returned to <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, where 131 people were allowed off, then was forced to go to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where it refueled, and to <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION>, an island off the coast of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. No one was injured. The captain, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, told the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> that he informed the hijacker the plane did not have enough fuel to reach <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the man's intended destination. <PERSON> Libardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arteaga </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, told radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that no one in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> _ neither police nor the control tower _ knew the plane was coming. As the plane was taxiing in the darkness toward the runway in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION>, the captain said, the crew noticed a light in the cabin indicating that the plane's rear stairway had been lowered. When the plane pulled up to the terminal at the <ORGANIZATION> Rafael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nunez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, police rushed aboard but could not find the hijacker, <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. The hijacker, who had gripped a hand grenade throughout, apparently fled in the darkness, <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. Police searched slums and a swampy area around the airport. Authorities identified the hijacker as <PERSON> Albeiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a Colombian, <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. He had no further information about the man's identity. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, security chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the plane landed in <LOCATION> Cartagena </LOCATION> at 6:57 p.m. -LRB- 7:57 p.m. EDT -RRB-. The craft took off from <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> at 6:15 p.m. EDT with almost no warning. The pilot radioed the control tower from 16,000 feet that he was heading for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhoff </PERSON>, public relations manager at <ORGANIZATION> Reina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. It was not clear why the pilot relayed that information. <PERSON> Dijkhoff </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that the sudden takeoff `` was a surprise. Radio communication was cut off. All of a sudden, the engines started and the plane took off.'' The hijacker was said to be carrying a pistol and two hand grenades in a suitcase. The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer were captive aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 landed in <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION> at 3:45 p.m. EDT after being refueled in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. On and off for the next 2 -LCB- hours, authorities talked with the hijacker by radio. <PERSON> Dijkhoff </PERSON> said the man repeated demands he made in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for $ 100,000 and safe passage to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The plane was neither refueled nor resupplied in this tiny autonomous member of the kingdom of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dijkhoff </PERSON> said. The air pirate told authorities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that he wanted to go to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> after stopping in <LOCATION> Aruba </LOCATION>, to pick up the ransom money, said Capt. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidlitz </PERSON>, security chief at <LOCATION> Omar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Torrijos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, about 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, 131 people, including three flight attendants, were allowed to leave the plane, said <PERSON> Yezid </PERSON> <PERSON> Castano </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chief. Earlier, Capt. <PERSON> Edgard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, the administration's security chief, said 135 people got off at <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, administrator at the Panamanian airport, told reporters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that the man was `` desquiciado'' _ Spanish for mentally unbalanced. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidlitz </PERSON> also said the hijacker `` could be crazy.'' <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> the hijacker said he wanted the money because he is suffering from a fatal disease and wants to spend his last days happily. The hijacker demanded the money in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but because of a banking crisis there the hijacker was told that payment was impossible, <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castano </PERSON> said released passengers reported the hijacker was short, blond, dressed in sports clothes and appeared to be about 30 years old. `` Everything happened very fast, but there was no panic,'' passenger <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Piedrahita </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> network. Another passenger, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Robledo </PERSON>, said he sat next to the hijacker, who gave a note to a flight attendant and she led him to the cockpit, <PERSON> Robledo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` Both the hijacker and the flight attendant were very nervous,'' <PERSON> Robledo </PERSON> said. `` Nothing happened, and 10 minutes after going back to the airport the pilot told everyone they should get off the plane.''

<HEAD>Far Right Walk Out on First South African Joint Debates in
Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White and non-white members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> took part in joint debates Monday for the first time. Members of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> walked out in protest. The party said in a statement the members wanted to `` record anew our deep-felt rejection of being co-governed by other population groups.'' The debates dealt with the budgets of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s four provinces and were conducted in the provincial capitals by members of the relevant committees in the white, Asian and mixed-race chambers of Parliament. The government, in revising parliamentary rules to allow the joint debates, stopped short of permitting joint voting on any issues. `` Until we can debate and vote together, this meeting today is an historical farce,'' said <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Asian and mixed-race chambers were created in 1984 under a new constitution which continued to exclude the black majority from national affairs. The white chamber, dominated by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is able to get its way on all major legislative issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with 23 of 178 seats, is the largest white opposition party. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> budget was debated, several legislators objected to stringent security checks conducted as they entered the meeting hall. `` We can not allow ourselves to be subjected to such demeaning checks,'' said <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seedat </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> chamber after he and other lawmakers were ordered to empty their pockets, offer their briefcases to be searched, and produce their parliamentary identity cards. During the debates, government officials pledged to expand black hospital facilities, suggested that new laws would be enacted to control black squatters, and reported that the first `` recreation resort'' for blacks in the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> would be ready next year. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A former professor suing to become the fifth woman granted tenure in the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 80-year history testified Monday that the academic guidelines were manipulated to deny her tenure because of her sex. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bund </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 44, who resigned in 1984, is asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodlock </PERSON> to reinstate her with tenure and award $ 847,000 in lost income. Manipulation of the tenure process and the use of review procedures different from those used for men are `` the absolute core of the discrimination,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> testified in the first day of her non-jury trial. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has also charged that the school destroyed documents requested by her to support her claim that less-qualified men received tenure from 1974 to 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> maintains in court papers that Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s academic work was substandard and that the tenure records were unwittingly destroyed by someone outside the business school. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> testified she was pressured into submitting new examples of her scholarship sooner than it was required. She also asserted that a faculty member threatened not to support her in her tenure bid because of conflicts over what material a course should cover. `` I believe this was done with the express purpose of discriminating against me on the basis of sex,'' she testified. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked repeatedly to cite specific incidents of sex bias she alleged against several faculty members. When she was unable to on one occasion, she said: `` To me bias is a spectrum and I do n't know where to draw the line in that spectrum,'' she said. In court papers, the school said that Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was given a `` virtually unprecedented'' second chance after she was denied tenure in 1981 and that the faculty voted by just 36-31 to support her 1983 bid, a low margin. A tenure committee rejected her. Tenure decisions at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> are submitted to the faculty to gauge support for the professor. The actual decision rests with the university president, who receives a recommendation from the school's dean. `` She was given an extremely thorough and fair review in 1981 and 1983 and the decision was made entirely on her academic qualifications,'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, said in court papers. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a marketing consultant, began teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> as an assistant professor in 1973. She was promoted to associate professor in 1977. In her first attempt at tenure, she failed to win support of the faculty, which cited inadequate scholarship. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was given a three-year extension on her appointment and submitted new academic work for review. Three of the 90 business school's tenured professors are women. Four women have received tenure in the business school's history, the first in 1961. The school said 27 percent of the 819 students in the class of 1988 were women. Legal experts say few gender bias cases make it to trial, and plaintiffs have won even fewer cases because judges are reluctant to rule on matters of academic merit. Nationally, 72 percent of male faculty members have tenure compared with 45 percent of females, according to a recent survey of 1,055 two - and four-year institutions by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professors </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard an appeal Monday by an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience who asked the judges to revoke a deportation order against him. He threatened to convert to Judaism and return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if the order stands. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, was ordered deported by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials on May 6. They said he had played a leading role in the 24-week Arab uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The three-judge panel reserved decision after Monday's appeal hearing, but did not set a date for its ruling. The decision is expected to have far-reaching consequences for the legal status of the 130,000 Arabs living in Israeli-annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. During the three-hour hearing, lawyers for both sides focused on <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s legal status under Israeli immigration law. The court must consider whether the Jerusalem-born Awad and other east Jerusalem Arabs enjoy an irrevocable status as permanent residents, or if they can lose their rights under certain conditions, such as leaving the country for more than seven years. <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, argued that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> should be deported because he forfeited his right to permanent residency by leaving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 13 years, from 1970 to 1983, and by accepting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, while maintaining a home in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had no right to deport his client because, as a longtime resident of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> enjoys a special status that can not be revoked. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, but never defined the legal status of the sector's Arab residents, most of whom rejected offers of Israeli citizenship. Ms. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> argued that since the annexation, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in practice has applied the rules of permanent residency to citizens of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> falls into that category. If the court rules in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, `` all east Jerusalemites are in danger of mass transfer,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> lawyer also representing the Arab-American. `` Those who grant residency permits can also take them away,'' he added. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who has been jailed since May 5, looked pale when he entered the packed courtroom wearing a beige suit and a blue-striped shirt. He kissed his American-born wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, and talked to reporters during recess. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> rejected government allegations that he had helped incite often violent anti-Israeli protests. He said he stood by his advocacy of non-violent action such as tax boycotts and strikes. He also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s effort to deport him has helped popularize his ideas. `` My ideas have caught, thanks to the Israelis who put so much pressure on me,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> seems fairly isolated in the Palestinian community, and underground leaders have not mentioned his case in the leaflets they distribute in the occupied lands. Asked what he would do if deported, he told reporters he had the option of converting to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> and coming back under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of Return, which grants automatic Israeli citizenship to all Jews. Awad is Christian. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s troubles began in August when the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to renew his identity card, issued by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1968. Since his return from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1983, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> had stayed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on tourist visas stamped into his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport, but in November the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to renew that permit.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday overruled a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> barring women from voting for the city's chief rabbi. The court ordered the council to hold new elections for its 10 delegates to the 30-member body which will elect the chief rabbi and warned it not to discriminate against women. The city's <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faction last year elected two women, <PERSON> Haviva </PERSON> <PERSON> Avigai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lili </PERSON> <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON>, to the elective body. The council nullified the choices under pressure from orthodox leaders, who said religious law forbade women from electing rabbis. Rabbi <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lau </PERSON>, Mayor <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON>'s choice for the vacant post, said at the time he would not submit his candidacy if women were on the elective body. Ms. <PERSON> Avigai </PERSON> hailed Monday's decision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has again shown it is the guardian of human rights and that women have equal rights,'' she said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>: `` We have a problem. It has been customary to choose someone to fill a traditional post in a traditional way.'' <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> has been without an Ashkenazi chief rabbi, one representing Jews of European descent, since late 1986 because of squabbling over female representation. Monday's decision was the latest in a series which have pitted the secular law of the land against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s religious establishment. The court also went against the rabbis' wishes last week, when it upheld the appointment of <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakdiel </PERSON>, the first woman nominated to serve on a religious council in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Deplore Anti-Semitism in Italy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops on Monday deplored recent demonstrations of anti-Semitism that have apparently occurred in reaction to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policies toward Palestinians. The statement by the Italian Bishops' Conference followed charges by Jewish leaders that the Italian press, including <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> publications, have helped incite anti-Semitism through their reporting on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. The bishops' statement, published in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> daily <PERSON> L'Osservatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> and carried by <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, made no direct reference to the allegations by Jewish officials. But it strongly urged Catholics to distinguish between the Jewish people and the policies of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government or political parties. `` The tensions between <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and Israelis continue to provoke in the Italian milieu, and therefore also among Catholics, grave preoccupations for the risk of distortions of information and consequent emotive reactions, which in the extremist fringes, can explode into violence,'' the statement said. `` Anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> seems to some a marginal phenomomen and uncharacteristic of Italian society,'' it added. `` Still, episodes of intolerance against Jews and Jewish institutions, occurring even recently ... provoke in our community feelings of profound preoccupation for the risk of painful civil and religious lacerations that can derive from them.'' The statement also stressed the need to `` promote a dialogue between Jews, Christians and Moslems and to be builders of peace together.'' Last week, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, <PERSON> Elio </PERSON> <PERSON> Toaff </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabban </PERSON>, president of the Jewish community, held a news conference to detail recent anti-Semitic incidents in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Among other things, they displayed packs of anonymous and threatening letters and dozens of photos of swastikas painted on walls. The two said the media, including <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> publications, fueled anti-Semitic feelings in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with reports from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that tend to compare Israelis to <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> because of the Israelis' policies toward Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> earlier expressed `` surprise'' at the Jewish allegations and noted that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has often spoken out against anti-Semitism. Riots began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At least 194 Arabs have been killed, and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and Jewish settler also have been slain.

 A new state law allowing students to choose their schools will improve education, proponents say.

The measure gives <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> the nation's broadest open enrollment plan, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said.

Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2 after instructors allegedly dragged him into a pool against his will and held his head underwater after he failed a rescue drill. Other recruits reportedly were told to turn their backs to the pool and sing `` The Star-Spangled Banner'' as loudly as they could to drown out <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s screams for help.

<TEXT>
 Three American writers, ostracized and ignored in their own country during their lifetimes, have an organization in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> dedicated to remembering their contributions to the communist revolution. The Smedley-Strong-Snow Society of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a wing of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in 1984 to honor the three Midwesterners who were among the first to tell the world of the cataclysmic events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1920s and'30s. The most famous of the trio is Edgar Snow -LRB- 1905-72 -RRB-, the first Westerner to interview <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> in the caves of their guerrilla stronghold in northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and author of `` Red Star Over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' his classic account of the communist leadership. He is joined by <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON> -LRB- 1892-1950 -RRB-, a fiery supporter of revolutionary causes; and <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> -LRB- 1885-1970 -RRB-, chronicler of socialist upheaval in both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In June, the `` 3-S Society'' marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of `` Red Star Over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' with a major symposium on the book at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The society, made up of more than 100 scholars and writers who knew the three Americans or studied their works, is also holding an essay contest on the book, and will invite students from schools in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Snow's hometown, to attend the symposium. `` We want young people to read history, to find out how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> traversed this road and reached this stage,'' said former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, president of the `` 3-S Society.'' <PERSON> Huang </PERSON>, Snow's interpreter when he interviewed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, said young Chinese read too many books of `` love, martial arts and adventure.'' Works of people such as Snow `` should be popularized so their contributions to the Chinese cause will not be forgotten.'' Snow arrived in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in 1927 for a planned six-week visit and stayed nearly 14 years. In one of journalism's greatest scoops, he found his way to the Red army headquarters in northwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Baoan </ORGANIZATION> in 1936 and spent five months observing and talking to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> and his fellow communists He was the first Western journalist to break the news blockade <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s Nationalists had imposed on the communists. `` Red Star,'' published in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1937 and in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the next year, became the seminal work on the band of revolutionaries who were to change the face of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His book gave not only the West but also many Chinese their first detailed look at the communist leaders, and many intellectuals trekked to communist headquarters after reading it. `` It's hard to imagine what our image of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be today without <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, a prominent writer on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said Snow, whom he met in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II, `` had been my hero as he had been the hero of a whole generation of newspaper men.'' Snow left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1941 and worked around the world as a roving correspondent for such publications as the Saturday Evening Post, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. In 1959, after years of being hounded by anti-communist McCarthyites, he left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But he was to make one last contribution to his native land: In 1970, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> told Snow that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would welcome a visit by then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, setting the stage for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s historic trip in 1972. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> showed its respect for Snow by sending a medical team to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in a futile attempt to save the life of the dying writer in 1972. Some of his ashes are buried in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and some on a university campus in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> where he once taught. Unlike Snow, who was never a Marxist, the two women writers were outspoken in their support for leftist causes. <PERSON> Smedley </PERSON>, born into poverty in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and raised in mining towns, was a strong advocate of women's rights and anti-colonial struggles in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She worked with <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Yat-sen </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Soong </PERSON> Ching-ling, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous modern writer, <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xun </PERSON>. She wrote a biography of Red army commander <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> and, in 1937 in the communist camp at <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION>, taught <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> and other communists to square dance. In 1949, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> report accused her of spying for the Soviets, and she died in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1950 while trying to get back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Strong, a native of Friend, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, was a pacifist opponent of World War I and left for the newly founded <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1921. A resident of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for almost 30 years, she wrote some 30 books on revolutions around the world. She, too, made her way to <LOCATION> Yenan </LOCATION> in 1937, and interviewed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in 1946 when he made his famous statement, `` All reactionaries are paper tigers.'' She was arrested as a spy and expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1949, only to be further attacked on her return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for her communist leanings. She died in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at age 84 during the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution, isolated in her last haven by the suspicion that prevailed then against all foreigners. <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshan </PERSON>, translator of a 1980 edition of `` Red Star Over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' that sold 1.3 million copies in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said the works of the three writers were not always welcomed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` After the revolution Snow was still taboo because he told the real story of the party. Some in the party took a negative view of this,'' he said. It was only after the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, <PERSON> Dong </PERSON> said, that `` Red Star'' and Snow found acceptance.

<HEAD>West Germans Worried by NATO's Tree-Skimming Warplanes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BORKEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fighter jet swoops about 250 feet over farmer <PERSON> Bernh </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>. The roar spooks their horse and scatters the hens across the barnyard. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> warplanes skimming over trees, farms and villages in mock battles have been a common sight in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for years. Airmen from seven nations in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, including <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, take part in a total of 70,000 low-level training flights in this country each year, more than in any other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> land, according to the West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. But thousands of West Germans now are saying they've had enough of it. `` I know the defense of our country is important, but these low-level fliers are annoying,'' said the 56-year-old <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON>, whose farm is just outside <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION> near the Dutch-West German border. `` Those jets are really a nuisance, and the animals do n't care too much for them either,'' said his wife. On one recent day, about 50 military jets were in the air over the <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION> area, many of them in low-level maneuvers. Opposition to the low-level flights soared after two recent crashes. On March 30 a French fighter jet crashed near a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. A day later, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 plummeted into a West German town, destroying homes and killing a resident. About 60,000 West Germans belong to grass-roots organizations pressuring the federal government to do something about low-level military flights, activists say. West Germans complain such flights give them nightmares, impair their hearing, cause high blood pressure and make their children irritable. `` I get these very ugly dreams,'' said <PERSON> Daerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Stechel </PERSON>, a 45-year-old activist who lives in <LOCATION> Wischhafen </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bremen </LOCATION> and hears <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jet fighters screeching overhead nearly every day. `` In one of them, I'm swimming in a very beautiful lake and suddenly jet fighters are falling all around me into the water. This is very bad,'' she said. Earlier this year, the respected <ORGANIZATION> Wickert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> polled West Germans and found that 15 percent want <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to stop its low-level military training flights. Two-thirds of the 1,710 people polled said such flights were necessary but that the number should be reduced, the institute said. `` Most people who oppose these flights are not members of the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s environmentalist party -RRB-, but just citizens who can not stand the noise any longer,'' said <PERSON> Udo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinner </PERSON>, a 45-year-old engineer and activist who lives in <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION>. `` For example, I am a conservative and am vehemently against the low-level flights.'' The low-level runs, in which the warplanes fly at altitudes as low as 250 feet, are limited to seven areas less densely populated than other parts of the country. Five areas are in the north half and two in the south. Forty percent of the low-level flights are by the West German air force, said <PERSON> Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaeschke </PERSON>, a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The remainder are flown by Americans, British, Dutch, French, Canadians and Norwegians, he said. All <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> flights in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are coordinated by a West German air force's control center in <LOCATION> Porz </LOCATION>, which is between <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies refuse to divulge how many warplanes are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which is temporary home to about 900,000 foreign soldiers. <PERSON> Jaeschke </PERSON> said the low-level flights are important for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> He added that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is considering a `` midday break'' of a couple hours a day when the jets would have to stay on the ground. In addition, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies are always looking for new technological means to soften the jets' roar. `` Much has been done in the last few years to lower the level of the noise from the jets,'' <PERSON> Jaeschke </PERSON> said. But he strongly rejected activists' views that low-level flights should be stopped. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, the Soviet bloc's defense alliance, has a numerical advantage over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in several areas, <PERSON> Jaeschke </PERSON> said. `` If our pilots train too little, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact advantage becomes greater.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> authorities also say low-level training flights are necessary. `` They are required to provide realistic training to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> air crews,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pascoe </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> 17th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> at Sembach Air Base near <LOCATION> Kaiserslautern </LOCATION>, said. `` We must train the way we expect to fight.''

 Academy Award-winner <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> says it was his character's `` Lolita'' - like relationship with a young girl that attracted him to the latest `` Desperado'' movie <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaten </PERSON>, a mine owner who offers to free roving cowboy <PERSON> Duell </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> from jail and a trumped-up murder charge if <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> will lead the search party to find <PERSON> Slaten </PERSON>'s abducted `` daughter.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, is the `` Desperado'' in this third movie in the series. Author <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> wrote the first movie about a young cowboy who's a fugitive from a phony charge. The latest film, `` Desperado: Avalanche at Devil's Ridge,'' airs tonight on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` My character has an obsession with this girl,'' said <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>. `` That's what interested me the most, this relationship with the girl. It made me think of ` Lolita.' Everybody thinks the girl's my daughter, but she's not.'' Slaten is the heavy of the film, but <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said he does n't play him that way `` I just think of him as a character to play,'' he said. `` Let the audience be the judge. I think the mistake a lot of actors make when they play a heavy is to go through the boards. `` Every human being has something he wants. If the something I want makes me a criminal, then I become the heavy. I wonder how many times I've been killed in films. I know it's at least 60 times. In early live television I was killed every week, it seems.'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>, who won an Oscar as best actor in 1967 for `` In the Heat of the Night,'' has been in only a few Westerns, although he professes a love for the genre. He starred in `` A Fistful of Dynamite,'' `` Jubal'' and `` Cattle <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> and Little Britches.'' He also starred in the 1955 movie version of the musical `` Oklahoma!'' playing <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, the bad guy in conflict with cowhand Curly, played by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> came out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> after World War II with no thought of acting. `` I saw all the pretty girls going into the theater program,'' he said. ` I had the GI <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> and could take acting lessons. I got $ 85 a month, lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and had a good time. `` But I fell in love with acting and became a fanatic. I kept telling myself not to get a job. You're not an actor yet. So I spent two years learning my profession. Then ` Philco Playhouse' called and offered me a few lines as a mechanic. For the next several years, he acted both on Broadway and in the `` golden age'' of live television drama. He was `` Marty'' on television, the drama that as a movie brought an Oscar to <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgnine </PERSON>. `` I thought I was going to do the movie,'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> said, `` but they wanted me to sign a seven-year contract. I said no. Two days later I got the part of <PERSON> Jud </PERSON> in ` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>! I'd tested for the role of Curly with an unknown actor named <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. Then I tested in the afternoon with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> for <PERSON> Jud </PERSON>.'' `` In the Heat of the Night'' has now become a series on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> plays the role <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> had in the film. <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> was not offered the role, but he said, `` I do n't know if I would have taken it. I did n't want to be in a rut. I wish they had called me, however, because my ego demands that.'' <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> has had an illustrious career. He was <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>'s corrupt brother in `` On the Waterfront. He played the title role in `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Rise in Ivory Prices Brings Surge in Elephant Slaughter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sharp rise in ivory prices has brought a surge in the slaughter of elephants by poachers in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s Tsavo National Park. The slaughter, which over the years has seen more than 80 percent of the park's herd perish, will continue until the illegal ivory trade is halted, said <PERSON> Esmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley-Martin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conservationist who has lived in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> for nearly 25 years and is an expert on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade. `` The short-term prognosis for elephants is dim,'' he said. `` People realize ivory is worth a lot outside the country. They essentially are raping a natural resource.'' Prices have reached $ 73 a pound, up from about $ 20 a pound five years ago, he said. An aerial survey in February of <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> and its surrounding ecosystem found 5,363 elephants, about a third the number at the beginning of the decade. The herd is about one-sixth the estimated 35,000 that remained in 1974 after a five-year drought killed 9,000, according to the survey sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the Kenyan government. Most of the bleached bones and rotted carcasses spotted in the 15,385-square-mile area were of elephants killed more than a year ago, according to the survey. <PERSON> Tedd </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON>, coordinator of anti-poaching efforts for <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>, credited intensified efforts by reinforced anti-poaching units in <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> with keeping the slaughter from getting even worse The slaughter of elephants by poachers is not confined to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and at the current rate of killings, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephants could conceivably be wiped out in eight to 10 years. But experts say it is not likely the world's biggest land animal will be hunted into extinction. They explained the elephants will continue to retreat to protected areas or deep into forests, making it more difficult for poachers to find them. However, the <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> slaughter dramatizes an alarming decline in elephant populations already evident from detailed counts taken of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s closely studied herds. Studies by the Nairobi-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- indicate a drop in population since 1973 of 85 percent in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and 89 percent in neighborng <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. Another neighbor <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, has lost 53 percent of its elephants in the last 10 years. `` Everyone knows that for years poachers have been killing elephants for ivory,'' <PERSON> Iain </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON>, a Scottish elephant expert in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, wrote recently in <LOCATION> Swara </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s bi-monthly magazine. `` What nobody appears to be aware of, other than a few wardens and wildlife scientists, is the extent of the destruction of elephants in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and how fast the remaining elephants are disappearing.'' <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON>, who helped assemble the <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> data, said information is scanty for the rest of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But he added that available information paints a picture that is similar to or worse than the elephants' situation in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. An estimated 750,000 elephants remain in all of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, down from about 1.3 million in the late 1970s, according to <PERSON> Bradely-Martin </PERSON>. The amount of ivory traded in the world market through 1985 averaged about 800 tons a year, representing an offtake of about 75,000 elephants annually, he said. He estimated that an additional 100 tons remains in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where it is `` carved up and sold on the tourist market.'' In the mid-1980s, perhaps 50 percent of all ivory leaving <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was illegal, according to <PERSON> Bradley-Martin </PERSON>, who said more current data were not available. Legal ivory is that which has been obtained through sanctioned culls of elephant herds, or from natural deaths. `` There is absolutely no way poaching could continue without senior collaboration in governments and business,'' <PERSON> Bradley-Martin </PERSON> said. In January, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> fired seven officials and disciplined eight field officers suspected of helping poachers or embezzling funds. It also named a new director. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also is cracking down on the illegal ivory market there and has imposed heavy fines and jail terms for people convicted of importing raw ivory without a license. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are the world's largest consumers of ivory, along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is considering legislation that would stop almost all ivory imports. <PERSON> Douglas-Hamilton </PERSON> believes the elephant slaughter will stop only when the ivory trade is banned altogether. `` Do n't buy it, do n't wear it, do n't sell it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 After six months in office, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> remains something of a mystery _ perhaps not an exciting one. Universally described as methodically attuned to solving problems rather than politicking, the 59-year-old <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is generally regarded as bland but the kind of leader <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> needs to solve problems slowing the decade-old modernization drive. Overshadowed by his predecessor, the urbane and nattily dressed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, and without power to singlehandedly formulate policy, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has yet to offer any bold initiatives. He has given few clues to his own vision of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s future or his goals as premier, other than reducing an 11 percent inflation rate. Although he is one of the five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most powerful policy-making body, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has been exceptionally cautious in public statements. He remains dogged by a widely held assumption that he owes his job to nepotism _ he is the adopted son of the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. His rise to the premiership was meteoric. He was appointed acting premier in November, just eight years after being given his first government post, minister of power. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, confirmed him as premier in April. A few days later, he became the target of satirical attacks in posters put up by students at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> can become premier, who ca n't?'' said one. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s main credentials for the job were his technical skills and connections. Trained as an engineer in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he spent most of his career running power projects and never ran a city or provincial government. After becoming minister of power in 1979, he rose in rapid succession to vice premier in 1983, Politburo member in 1985 and education minister later that year. As education minister, he escaped responsibilty for the widespread pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87, saving himself by denouncing liberal intellectuals. Many intellectuals dislike him for that and for his failure to improve their salaries and living conditions. However, unpopularity is the least of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s problems because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premiers are selected by party leaders, not the ballot box. He must cope with inflation that has reached its current 11 percent from 6 percent two years ago. He also must unclog chronic supply bottlenecks and get rid of waste in government offices and state factories. But any dramatic initiatives to do all those things would need the approval of fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, including <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, his predecessor. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had a mandate for change when he became premier in 1980 and many of his policies remain in force. That leaves <PERSON> Li </PERSON> with the task of trying to implement policies set by <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who may not look kindly on any changes in them by an underling. When <PERSON> Li </PERSON> took office, it was widely speculated he favored central planning over <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s market-style reforms. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s comments have given no sign he opposes those reforms. But <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s reforms have hit snags that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> now must try gingerly to resolve. One is economic incentives, such as bonuses, for workers who increase productivity. They were liberally distributed and had come to be automatic. In addition, the bonuses are said to have eaten into capital investment and helped fuel inflation. An Asian diplomat quoted Chinese sources as saying <PERSON> Li </PERSON> recently refused to approve automatic bonuses, maintaining the incentives should be more closely linked to production increases. That report remains to be confirmed. But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has made city mayors responsible for decontrolling state-subsidized food prices. And in a profile of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s first 130 days in office, the official weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Liaowang </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Outlook -RRB- credited him with playing a major role in working out a plan to streamline and reorganize the government bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Ice Cream Entrepreneur Claims 751 Flavors, Including `Sex'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN M. ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ice cream entrepreneur <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> did n't believe vanilla and chocolate were enough to draw in customers, so he added such flavors as fire, flying fish _ and sex. `` Sex is the most exotic,'' the 37-year-old <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> said. Asked what's in it, he replies: `` Large, ripe, juicy <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> cherries that simmer in crystal-clear champagne until they pop.'' <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON>'s recipe for the flying fish flavor includes fish mash and smooth peanut butter, as well as milk, eggs and butter. The flying fish is the national symbol of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, a former British colony. `` I just invented a new flavor, to commemorate the island's 21st anniversary of independence,'' <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> said. The concoction includes 21 different kinds of fruit and is called, appropriately enough, `` The 21.'' It tastes like a very rich punch. <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he studied to be a clothes designer. He ran his own small store until his Barbados-born wife, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, suggested eight years ago that an ice cream shop in her prosperous and hot <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island might be more fun and profitable. <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> sold his business in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and went to <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, where he served an apprenticeship at Fragole <PERSON> Fabri </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s biggest ice cream factories `` I learned the basics, just enough to make vanilla ice cream,'' he said. `` After the first six months, I knew how to make ice cream, but I had to learn to improve it and then to master it.'' Today, he said, `` I am the king.'' <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> makes 18 flavors fresh each day. He claims he has created 751 in all, and is seeking an entry in the Guinness Book of Records. `` Every single recipe is different,'' he said. `` I do not take a vanilla base ... and simpl change the name as I add different ingredients.'' <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> also meets special requests. On Wednesdays, he prepares ice cream for diabetics, using artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. For vegetarians, <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> makes carrot and zucchini ice cream. Creamy avocado also is popular. Not every flavor is a bestseller. `` Tomato did not do too well,'' he said. `` Too acidic.'' Some flavors contain promotional gimmicks. The main ingredient in `` money'' ice cream is a tightly-rolled <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> dollar wrapped in plastic. <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> did not set out to become a one-man <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> or <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s when he opened Gelato five years ago in a chic mall in suburban <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michael </LOCATION>, one mile outside <LOCATION> Bridgetown </LOCATION>. But shipping delays, high costs and import duties convinced him he could not rely on importing the `` starters,'' or basic flavors, from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I first started experimenting with local fruits,'' he said. Now, his favorite sherbets are made with mangoes, watermelons and passion fruit. <PERSON> Sandford </PERSON> wo n't say what goes into his `` fire'' ice cream, which tastes like hot cinnamon candies. But he guarantees, `` This will burn your palate.''

<HEAD>New Survival Book has Tips on How to get Though a Hijacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Not only does it offer tips on how to live on seawater or finding your way out of a jungle, <PERSON> Martyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>'s new survival manual has advice on how to get through a hijacking <PERSON> Martyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> claims his `` Survival Skills Handbook'' includes the first `` how-to'' guide for hijack hostages. `` The book is about survival in any situation ... whether your plane has crashed or whether you're in a situation where you are trapped, you're a hostage,'' he said in an interview. `` The main premise of the book is that you'll survive if you think you can. No situation shows that better than the hostage situation.'' Most of <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>'s suggestions involve coping mentally with being held hostage. Captives should `` keep busy with mental activity and avoid depression,'' he writes. `` Always remember that the captors can control your body, but they can not control your mind.'' Hostages should try to establish a rapport with their kidnappers, he advises, but adds that `` logic is not valid in this sort of situation: relate on an emotional level.'' Communicating with a nervous, trigger-happy hijacker can be risky, he says, but `` it's something that's worth trying if you physically can.'' The book also suggests precautions for international travelers worried about hijackers: do n't wear military-style clothing or carry military identification papers. `` You'd be surprised at the number of people who get on airplanes in camouflage military jackets and dog tags around their necks,'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said. The book also recommends that air passengers carry family photographs in their passports or wallets. `` They will make you appear a family person with dependents, and a less likely candidate, it is hoped, for execution.'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said the book's section on hostages and hijackings contains `` tried and tested'' ideas, as well as `` theoretical models of people who are dealing in this field, ... clinical psychologists who are actually involved in hostage situations.'' With hijackers becoming more sophisticated, he said, potential victims need to be better prepared. In a hijacking, he said, `` what you can do to physically help yourself is incredibly limited. But what you can do to keep yourself sane is entirely up to you. You either help yourself or you do n't.'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, 35, says he gained his expertise while undergoing military training courses in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He has never been involved in a hijacking, and admits his expertise is more on the techniques, but an expert on terrorism who reviewed <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>'s suggestions agrees that publishing them is a good idea. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamczewski </PERSON> of the London-based Institute for the Study of Terrorism found the advice for hostages sensible `` provided you can take it in.'' `` Most of such advice is really common sense,'' he said in an interview, `` and some people ca n't be calm in such circumstances.'' While mental preparation is important, <PERSON> Adamczewski </PERSON> said, the book's best advice is that international airline passengers should carry as little identification with them as possible. `` The Survival Skills Handbook'' is available in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other English-speaking countries, and <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> hopes to publish it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soon. He maintained that with his advice, travelers will at least be able to find comfort in the fact that they have done something to protect themselves. `` They can actually think: ` Right, I'm scared about the journey. I can take those labels off my suitcase. I can make sure I've got a nice picture of my wife and kids, or husband, in my wallet. So at least if I am stuck in that situation, I've done what I can,''' he said.

<HEAD>Pets and Summer: Special Attention Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dogs and cats have become major parts of millions of American families, and when summer brings hot weather and vacation travel, pets need some special attention. Summer means added hazards for pets, from heatstroke to heartworms. But, with help, pets can cope. They can even go along on most vacation trips, according to pet care experts. Probably the biggest hazard faced by pets in the summer is overheating, particularly if left in an automobile, even for a brief period. `` On a warm day, the temperature in a parked car can reach 160 degrees in a matter of minutes, even with partially opened windows,'' warns the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` With only hot air to breathe, your pet can quickly suffer brain damage or die from heatstroke.'' The simple answer is do n't leave the pet alone in a parked car. Leave them home when on a trip to the store or other errand. If dogs are left outdoors, make sure they have shade available and fresh water _ check the yard at all times of the day, to be sure shade is always available. Cats, says the Humane Sociaty, should be kept indoors all year _ it keeps them from overheating, from getting run over by cars and from other hazards. Joggers and beach fans also need to remember that what's fun for them may be dangerous for a dog. Canines will try and keep up with a jogging master, and an out-of-shape pooch can injure itself by pushing beyond its limits. And dogs were simply not built for the beach, where there is little shade and they can overheat, burn the pads of their feet and be attacked by sand fleas. As humidity goes up, dog heat tolerance goes down, and dogs do n't sweat to relieve the heat the way humans do, according to animal care specialists at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Still, traveling with a pet can be fun, especially if you get them checked in advance by a veterinarian and provide a good travel carrier. Bring along familier food, stop frequently to give them water and let them exercise, and make sure to have two collars on the dog _ with identification on both _ in case they slip out of the one with the leash attached. Many hotels and motels accept pets, and airlines will make special arrangements for them. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> <PERSON> Petfoods </PERSON> have put together a handy pamphlet on traveling with pets, called `` Pets on the Go.'' It discusses health and safety in traveling, what to take along, and many other considerations. Copies are available free at local AAA offices or by sending a stamped, self-addressed long envelope to Pets on the Go, <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, 8111 <LOCATION> Gatehouse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 22047. One added thought about vacations: The <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> notes that some people will adopt a stray animal while on vacation, then leave it behind when they return home. Lonely, scared and hungry, these `` leftovers'' will wander in search of their owners until killed by a passing car, disease or starvation, the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> warns. People who can no longer care for an animal should at least take it to the nearest animal shelter. As to summer's more routine problems, here are some thoughts from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>: _ Heartworms are a major danger in summer and can cause death to a dog They are transmitted by mosquitoes and are most common in warm areas, but are spreading. Have dogs checked by a vet and then begin use of preventive medication. _ Fleas and ticks can cause major discomfort and may carry disease Special soaps, collars, powders and sprays can help, but be sure to get the brand labeled for your pet _ do n't use dog sprays on a cat, for example. Serious cases may require veterinary care. _ Regular grooming is important for dogs, to find ticks and brush out tangles and mats from the coat It's not a good idea to shave long-haired dogs, though, since the coat protects them from sunburn and for some breeds it insulates them from the heat.

 By almost any definition the annual inflation rate is under 5 percent and unlikely to move much higher than that in the near future. But, as you probably have suspected, that does n't mean your personal rate ca n't rise faster than that. If you are inclined toward so-called finer things, your inflation rate could be close to double-digit. But in all probabilility, the higher your personal inflation rate the more you can do about it, most directly by dropping your sights to alternative purchases that cost less and maybe serve as well or better. Evidence of this comes in the National Financial Planning Index, produced by the 24,000-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>. This year it is 9 percent higher than 1987 for a very atypical basket of goods. The essentials: A $ 75,000 annual income, a one-child family, an upscale home, financing for a retirement plan, saving for a four-year private college education, payments for a new car, a one-week vacation, a $ 500,000 life insurance policy. After setting money aside for paying taxes, the association informs us, this family is likely to have only 25 percent left for food, medicine, monthly bills and clothing. But is the family pressed? Or is it pressed only because of its conception of what is important in life? The assumptions: _ A 7 percent, 25-year mortgage on a $ 258,098 home in an affluent suburb _ Financing, over a 25-year period, of a retirement plan to yield $ 169,000 a year _ Saving over a 12-year period to finance a four-year, private college education for the one youngster _ Financing a $ 16,162 car _ <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> LeBaron _ over a four-year period _ Saving for a one-week family vacation in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to cost $ 2,334 -LRB- not including food and personal expenses -RRB- _ Annual cost of a $ 500,000 life insurance policy _ State, federal and social security taxes All this, according to those folks dedicated to helping you make ends meet, will cost $ 55,896, or 74.6 percent of gross household income, a 9 percent jump over similar costs in 1987. In offering this National Financial Planning Index, the association includes an unusual caveat: `` This family needs to readjust spending goals.'' Why issue such an index, especially in view of the statement by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, the association's chairman, that `` we are not telling people they should be spending three-quarters of their income on all of these items.'' Rather, he continued, `` We hope people will look at this index, examine their own financial situation, set some realistic goals and objectives for themselves and then adjust their present budgets as necessary.'' Realism is n't difficult to apply to the association hypothesis. Why insist on an upscale home in an affluent suburb? Why assume it will not rise in value and thus afford the occupants a big gain toward their retirement fund? Why look forward to retirement with a plan that relies partially on the assumption that savings will earn 7 percent income while inflation amounts to 5 percent, for a net of 2 percent? Why would anyone save $ 6,648 a year for college tuition at a 7 percent rate while inflation also roared along at 7 percent _ which, in this instance, the index assumes? Who needs an annual vacation in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>? Who needs an upscale automobile?

<HEAD>Bridging the Gap: Pepsi, Jeans Show U.S. Influence on Soviet
Society</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Images of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dancing to rock music in a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> commercial flicker across the Soviet television screen, and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans hug the hips of young Russians in a crowded subway car. Amerika, as the Soviets call it, has arrived. `` Far behind the Iron Curtain, we were able to develop a pro-Western mentality, and what, tell me, could be more Western than <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' emigre author <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Aksyonov </PERSON> wrote about his youth in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the 1950s. Even the Cyrillic alphabet has n't prevented what the Russians call <LOCATION> Amerikanizatsia </LOCATION>. `` Jeansi,'' `` stop,'' `` break dance,'' `` OK'' and one of the latest signs of the times _ `` stress'' _ are now part of the Russian lexicon. Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged his people to learn more about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. To demonstrate his sincerity, he has allowed more travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, ended the jamming of <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> broadcasts and removed barriers to joint business deals. In April, a record 1,200 Soviets, most of them Jews, were allowed to visit relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An additional 1,000 Soviets traveled there on official business. Before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, only a handful of Soviets visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> monthly. The 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit gave an official stamp of approval to cultural agreements and `` people-to-people'' exchanges. Under the agreements, Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lawyers, doctors, students, musicians, scientists and teachers have visited each other. In some instances, the exchanges reflect a Soviet desire for American help in tackling social problems such as alcoholism and drug addiction, problems the government previously denied existed. At the grass-roots level, Soviets need little encouragement to talk about things American. When introduced to an American, many Soviets immediately start with the questions, on everything from war and peace to the availability of hamburgers. A taxi driver's reaction when a passenger introduced himself as an American was to run down the American authors she loved _ <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON>. Collections of these authors in translation occupy prominent places on the bookshelves in some Soviet apartments. More contemporary American authors are lesser known because their works still are n't available in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans are required attire in certain circles. And some of those who manage to get an American candy bar, soft drink or pack of cigarettes proudly display the empty packaging in their living rooms. Many Soviets are turning to videotapes for a glimpse of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Tapes of movies such as `` Police Academy'' and `` Rambo,'' dubbed in Russian, are passed among friends in a thriving black market where blank cassettes cost at least 50 rubles -LRB- $ 80 -RRB-, or one quarter of an average monthly salary. The black market also feeds on young Soviets' thirst for American rock music. Records of <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fetch exorbitant sums. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s music videos have appeared on Soviet television, and his <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> commercials hit the airwaves in mid-May during broadcast of a five-part series on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officially sponsored concerts by American musicians such as <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Brubeck </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> have become major happenings. At the same time, some Soviet rock stars are traveling to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebenshchikov </PERSON>, the hippy-like leader of the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> rock band Aquarium, is scheduled to record an album in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this summer. The end of Soviet jamming of Voice of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> broadcasts in May 1987 opened a new source of information about life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Satellite television discussions with American studio audiences also have given Soviets a chance to learn first-hand about life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Soviet television's widely watched evening news program `` Vremya'' has shown features on child care, automobiles and sports in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and in mid-May Soviet television broadcast a series moderated by former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. But even though Soviet media coverage about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become more balanced under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, reports about crime, unemployment, racism and the poor are still common. In politics, Americans and Soviets still have sharp differences. But for many of the Soviets who viewed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a warmonger a few years ago the rhetoric has eased since he signed an agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles. `` We have no propaganda of hatred toward Americans, no disrespect of Americans,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teachers of Russian who met with him at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> last August. `` One can not find them here, either in politics or in teaching.''

 Both parties are about set on their presidential nominees. With the season of preliminary winnowing nearly over, it's worth recapturing its gaudier moments and amazing contretemps. The primary campaigns may not have produced startling breakthroughs in political ground but, as the following report shows, they rank high in the long tradition of politics as entertainment.

 Once there were 14 candidates for president. Now there are three. Has the wheat been separated from the chaff? Has it been survival of the fittest or survival of the hardiest, richest, cleverest, slickest? Best or not, this is what's left after the strangest primary season in memory, a mad marathon in which history was shaped by philandering and plagiarism, pratfalls and yawns. Now, finally, the pack has dwindled down to a tidy few after 66 primaries and 42 precinct caucuses across the land and in all the island territories and clusters of expatriates abroad. About 30 million people have voted, at least $ 170 million has been spent, 42 debates have been debated, umptyfour-hundred speeches have floated up to the poor ozone in clouds of charge and countercharge on the order of `` so's your old man.'' The last pockets of insomniac resistance have fallen. It is a campaign that has gone from the <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to `` Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' a movie about white liberals who suddenly learn their daughter is dating a black man. In February, people were asking what does <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> really want, a cabinet job? In March, they were beginning to wonder whom President <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would put in his cabinet. By June, they were asking what Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would settle for outside the Oval Office. Candidates moved ahead, candidates fell behind, definitions twisted, rationalizations multiplied. The media decreed that a man loses if he does not win by enough. Even winning big could be suspect. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won big in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. But Hark! An exit poll then showed that fewer of his supporters voted for him `` with enthusiasm'' than did the voters for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. Meaningful? Ominous? There was something for everybody. If you ran second, it was because the winner outspent you. If you ran third, it was because he distorted your record. If you ran fourth, you emphasized that you trounced the man who ran fifth. If you ran fifth, you exulted in the fact that you did better than last week. If you ran last, you dug down deep and claimed you were doing better than expected. Sooner or later they all beat `` expected.'' Something for everybody. In 1936, <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> was buried by <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in the greatest -LRB- until then -RRB- landslide in history. Some years later, <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> and his wife ran into <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, the perennial Socialist candidate. <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> said, `` Dear, I'd like you to meet the man I licked in 1936. The election of 1988 already owns a unique place in history on several counts, we are told by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boller </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, author of `` Presidential Campaigns.'' No black candidate became a major factor in a presidential election before. No man was a candidate twice in the same campaign. No previous race had two preachers running. No candidate ever quit the race before because of infidelity or plagiarism. Though presidential candidates from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> have been whispered about before, none lost an election because of bedroom sport. But fate failed <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> even in the tiny detail. For example, the boat he and the young model shared in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Could n't it have been named something romantic but impersonal like Windsong or North Star, or something personal but innocent like Bonus Baby or Dad's Day Off, or something presidential like Destiny or Yankee Leader, but why, by what mystical movement of the spheres, did they reach so far down the scale of human aspiration to call it _ months later, one still cringes _ to call it Monkey Business? In their zeal, reformers have managed to steer the nominating process out of the smoke-filled rooms and into the gas-filled frenzy of more primaries and more candidates. The traffic is particularly heavy when the incumbent is not running and the heir apparent is less than apparent. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was clearly the front-running Democrat until he quit. Then speculation and attention fastened on three non-candidates, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and Senators <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The actual candidates had trouble getting their names in the papers until someone raised the shades on Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. There, suddenly, was a candidate for president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> giving voice to words, images and reflections that belonged to the head of the British <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Caught, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> confessed his `` mistakes'' and withdrew. The urge to confess, it seemed, was in the air. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager confessed he was the one who blew the whistle on <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, which he figured was, after all, his job. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> confessed how sorry he was and his campaign manager resigned in the spreading mea culpa. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> confessed to infidelity. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, campaigning on a call for pre-marital restraint, was caught with his marriage license showing, and confessed that, yes, it was dated only 10 weeks before his son's birth certificate. Across the political landscape, Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> tripped on his way to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> when he confessed he had once smoked marijuana. So did I, said <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. Me, too, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. I have sinned, wept <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who was n't even a candidate. It would be difficult to choose among the campaign's most dramatic moments. For example: High noon in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Eyes cold with anger, the minority leader strode around the well of the chamber to the presiding officer's desk, where sat the vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` What kind of candidate would put out a statement attacking another candidate and his wife without reading it?'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> snapped. `` Your people called me a ` cornered lap dog,''' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I did n't call you a lap dog,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Robert Dole.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> might've settled it at 50 paces <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the campaign. High noon on the Evening News. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> wanted to talk about Iran-Contra. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to talk about education and the deficit. Rather said he wanted to set the record straight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Rather had impugned his integrity. Rather said he did n't want to be argumentative, but. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was unfair to judge his whole record by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and -LRB- as if bringing up a family scandal -RRB- `` how would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set?'' Rather said it was more important to discuss <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s qualifications for president than -LRB- as if delicately paraphrasing a profanity -RRB- `` what you just referred to. The temperature rose, the pace quickened and soon both were talking at once and, mercifully, neither could be heard. In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other, relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coast wondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican, the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front-runner since he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues were as hard to find as passion. Almost invariably, nobody picked on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or the reincarnated <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other's non-existent <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, once the voice of protest in the land, took on the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided the others when they lost their heads and became adversarial. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, of course, could n't do anything about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. On national TV one night, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of `` lying'' about his record, and across the land political behaviorists tsked and said was n't that shocking? Through the last century, calling presidential candidates liar was a relatively polite form of discourse. They were also called traitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket, syphilitic, gorilla. In the campaign of 1800, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' Federalists described <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> as a `` mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> mulatto father ... raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse-ground Southern corn, bacon and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>'s Republicans lashed back by spreading a story that President <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was plotting to marry off one of his sons to a daughter of King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to begin an American dynasty and revive royal links with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In the politesse of the 1988 primary campaign, candidates grappled more with their image than with each other. Media consultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, for example, had to fight a mean streak; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a wimp streak. Other perceived streaks to be resisted were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, mechanistic; <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, militaristic; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> du Pont IV, rich; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, dull; <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, `` funny facts.'' They tried various disguises. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> smiled more. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thrashed Rather. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> danced to bouzouki music. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> flipped pancakes. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> cozied a baby pig. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said call me <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> brought the Democrats odd headlines. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> took care of the Republicans. In his autobiography, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wrote that God had told him a minister should not run for public office. Then he announced he might run for president. Then his book was re-issued, with God's injunction excised Then he announced that <PERSON> God </PERSON> was now telling him to run. No other candidate claimed that endorsement. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> let it be known that the Russians still had nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Not true, said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but its source was a satellite only 2,000 miles up.

 The Sicilian Mafia, far from beaten by mass arrests, is diversifying its drug operations and reverting to lucrative extortion and kidnapping, Italian officials say. Pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> has cut its share of the American heroin market from one-third down to barely 10 percent, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say, but sales have been channeled instead to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Mafia wholesalers are pushing cocaine into new European markets. They exchange heroin directly for Colombian cocaine, eliminating the cash transfers that make them vulnerable. A defector has implicated two recent cabinet ministers, echoing others' statements that senior political figures protect the Mafia, but police say they have no proof to move against politicians. `` Trials alone are not enough,'' said <PERSON> Giusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciacchitano </PERSON>, a senior prosecutor, interviewed in the concrete bunker where a team of magistrates piece together evidence for continuing `` maxi-trials.'' Under new laws, Italian authorities have seized $ 200 million in suspect earnings since 1982. In December, 338 Mafiosi were given 2,665 years of sentences after the first maxi-trial. In April, a joint U.S.-Italian operation disrupted the Pizza Connection, which markets Mafia heroin in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Police arrested <PERSON> Emanuele </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamita </PERSON>, a fugitive Sicilian drug lord, and 101 others. But public fear, official corruption, lack of evidence, foreign refuges and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s legal system were all obstacles, <PERSON> Sciacchitano </PERSON> said. `` The Mafia is very hard to beat. Very hard.'' After the maxi-trial verdicts were delivered, hit men on a motorscooter murdered <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Insalaco </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> mayor who fought corruption, as he sat at the wheel of his car in rush-hour traffic. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, prosecutors can not plea bargain, nor can police infiltrate. The law requires that all crimes be punished, even when committed by undercover officers or state's witnesses as part of an investigation. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is ill-equipped to protect informers and their families from Mafia vengeance. <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>, the Mafia boss-informer behind the first maxi-trials, took refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> helped convict <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciancimino </PERSON>, ex-mayor of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Sciacchitano </PERSON> said politicians were difficult to put on trial. A parliamentary committee linked <PERSON> Ciancimino </PERSON> to the Mafia in 1976. `` The Mafia has always been at the edges of power,'' said <PERSON> Attilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolzoni </PERSON>, a journalist who was arrested recently after reporting on an informer's confession that named two ministers. He was held six days, then released. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say privately that although <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has scored important victories, little will change if public officials close to the Mafia were not rooted out. Apart from outright graft, diplomats say, some politicians court the vital Sicilian vote by going easy on the issue. Italian authorities are divided on how far the Mafia reaches into the state. <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s national police force, said: `` We have no evidence. Of course, there is some official corruption. That is normal. But politicians belonging to the Mafia, I do n't think so.'' <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON> contends that with uncounted billions of dollars in drug revenue, with sanctuaries provided by Latin American governments, the Mafia no longer needs political protection. Authorities have arrested 4,100 suspected Mafiosi since 1982, he said. `` But they can replace them overnight in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, with all its unemployment and poverty,'' he added. For many Sicilians, going after the Mafia is tantamount to trying to suppress the weather. `` Hah,'' snorted an entrepreneur named <PERSON> Napoli </PERSON> when asked if the Mafia had been weakened. He drove his questioner by the leafy piazza where <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosino </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> detective, was murdered in 1902. <PERSON> Petrosino </PERSON>, who was investigating the Mafia, was shot with a sawed-off shotgun known as a lupara. Modern versions, submachine guns, more recently killed an average of one person a day in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>. Italian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities agreed that Mafia families had made a strategic retreat to regroup, not only reorganizing their drug operations but also concentrating more on extortion and ransom. Such venerable dons as <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Liggio </PERSON>, convicted in the maxi-trial, live lavishly in prison, with servants bringing them champagne meals from <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>'s finest restaurants. `` These guys can run a drug operation from inside prison just as well as they can outside,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement officer observed.

 <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Riina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> of the dominant <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family are still loose. Besides, police say, the Mafia is known as `` la piovra,'' the octopus, because it regenerates severed tentacles. By `` the Mafia,'' Italians mean about 30 Sicilian `` families,'' linked in crime not blood, whose worldwide income makes up perhaps 1-2 percent of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s gross national product. Thousands of men sworn to silence by the code of `` omerta'' supervise couriers, bag men, informers and enforcers. <PERSON> Grassi </PERSON> estimates as many as 50,000 people might be involved in Mafia operations. Sicilian patriarchs hold tight sway over family branches in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, rarely trusting home-grown mobs that often go under the generic label of Mafia. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officers discovered that heroin networks were compartmentalized so that couriers knew only their immediate controller. Families made sure that key people do not talk. `` We found that every time we got up to a certain level, we had a homicide on our hands,'' one senior agent said. The drug traffic brought deep changes to the Mafia, which had evolved slowly from its roots in feudal <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> where it once defended rural landowners. The Mafia has specialized in construction but kept a hammerlock on <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s economy. Shopkeepers pay a `` pizzo,'' a premium against petty criminals or untoward accidents. Public services must contend with <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> for labor and services. <PERSON> Palermo </PERSON> is the last major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> city to dig itself out from World War II; its old port is pocked with crumbling buildings and gaping empty spaces. Mayor <PERSON> Leoluca </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, staunchly anti-Mafia, fears contracts awarded to local companies will enrich criminals. In the past, reconstruction was stalled because so much money was stolen. In the city of <LOCATION> Catania </LOCATION>, an American-trained doctor said, `` They are in everything. They decide who is hired and they take a cut of what is purchased.'' One public hospital spent enormous sums for spoiled food from a Mafia-run catering service after its kitchen was destroyed mysteriously, he said. In the 1970s, after the French Connection was severed in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, the Sicilian Mafia hired Lebanese chemists and took over the business. Vast new revenues made the Mafia a major multinational. Sleek, ruthlessly ambitious young men began replacing folkloric dons in baggy pants. The title `` Honorable Society'' lost meaning for Sicilians who once condoned it. By some estimates, their drug turnover reached $ 10 billion a year at its peak. In the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> killers began striking back at the state. In 1982, <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiesa </PERSON>, a popular police general who had fought the Red Brigades, was sent to <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> to quell the Mafia. He and his wife were murdered in a spray of bullets. Hours earlier, <PERSON> Dalla </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiesa </PERSON> had complained to a diplomat that <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> had not delivered promised support. At the funeral, his daughter <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, a television journalist in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, returned flowers to officials she suspected were implicated. `` I do n't know if the Mafia is weaker now, but people are no longer afraid to say its name,'' she said in a recent interview. In 1982, the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Torre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, named after a murdered legislator, made <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> membership illegal and allowed property seizures. Since then, a growing `` anti-Mafia'' is speaking out. Many young Sicilians say they are tired of seeing their province paralyzed by fear and stagnation. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, widow of a crusading magistrate murdered in 1980, has since become a regional legislator dedicated to the anti-Mafia. `` We can fight them only by mobilizing people, by teaching children about the dangers they face,'' she said. `` We must say no to the Mafia.'' Even within the Mafia, some of the Old Guard draw the line at killing wives and using women to smuggle drugs. <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> said the breaching of old codes was a reason he turned against the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>. In the anteroom outside <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>'s office, supplicants wait on dark wood benches for solutions to their problems. City officials know that if they do not respond, the Mafia might. Judge <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, the flamboyant head magistrate, lives behind a 24-hour guard of heavy arms, vault locks and television cameras, with varying support from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He canceled scheduled anti-Mafia courses at a local university when authorities decided it was just too dangerous. In some ways, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> is more a prisoner than the men he has locked up. <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Liggio </PERSON>, in a well-appointed cell, took up painting nature scenes. His first show sold out, and he put the earnings toward a kidney clinic for the grateful citizens of <LOCATION> Corleone </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 When warm weather covers <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s ancient hills in flowers, bus loads of Americans converge on Corleone seeking `` The Godfather.'' They have no more success than Italian police. As it turns out, the <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> family now dominates the <ORGANIZATION> Sicilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>, a loose confederation of maybe 30 groups, but <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> -LRB- played by <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> in the movie -RRB- does not come from this little agricultural town. Most American branches of the Sicilian Mafia emigrated from <LOCATION> Agrigento </LOCATION>, an ancient port now choked with new construction from illegal money sent home. <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> is so poor that its 300-year-old town hall, damaged 20 years ago in an earthquake, is in danger of collapse. There is plenty of Mafia money, but it is seldom flaunted. Among most of the 11,100 inhabitants of <LOCATION> Corleone </LOCATION> and its surrounding fields, the word `` Mafia'' produces a nervous chuckle or a silent stare. No, they will tell you, they do not know if patriarchs <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Riina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> are hiding in the well-charted hills. At town hall, however, Vice Mayor <PERSON> Cosmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> rejects the idea that his town is especially touched by the Sicily-wide phenomenon. `` We have a long anti-Mafia tradition,'' he said, producing a folder that mentioned a crusading mayor murdered in 1918. When his visitor noted it did not specify who killed him, <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> replied, `` Sir, this is a tourist brochure.'' Deserved or not, <PERSON> Corleone </PERSON> has gotten used to the nickname some Italians have given it: Tombstone. `` We had a Japanese TV crew here,'' <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> said. `` I explained carefully how all this Godfather business was Hollywood fantasy. When I finished, they said, ` Yes, we understand, now show us the Godfather's house.'''

 As prime fish habitats become more and more vital to the tourist industry and state economies, so has government's role in stocking streams and lakes. Hard-core fly fishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, but defenders say that without extensive stocking, thousands of anglers would never catch a fish at all. This is the second of three articles.

 It was a fisherman's fantasy come true: swimming together in an undulating black wave were 30,000 trout. There was, however, a problem for the eager angler. Each of the creatures darting around in the concrete tank's 46.5-degree water was less than half an inch long. At the <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchery </PERSON>, one of 12 run by <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, three employees raise nearly 2 million fish every year. The dozen state hatcheries `` planted'' 32 million fish in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> waters in 1987. Nearly all were trout. They are kept in temperature-controlled indoor and outdoor tanks, depending on their size, and are fed a high protein `` trout chow'' composed of fish meal, liver and grain. A pathologist regularly checks them for viral diseases and parasites. State biologists continually survey lake and stream fish populations and place orders for varieties according to need. The <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchery </PERSON> raises seven kinds of trout as well as Arctic grayling and <LOCATION> Kokanee </LOCATION> salmon. The fish range from fry less than an inch long, through fingerlings, up to catchables 8 inches and larger. There are even lunkers, 3-pounders that produce spawning eggs, which are released into streams as 6-year-olds when their egg quality declines. Hatchery fish production is at an all-time high in many states, although budget cutbacks in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have affected some government programs. `` The demand for fish is increasing every year and we're producing the maximum here that we can,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> manager <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheeney </PERSON> That's because all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> right now fishermen are untangling lines, buying licenses and plunging with gusto into another season of hope. A recent Gallup poll ranked fishing as the nation's second most popular outdoor sport, just behind swimming and ahead of bicycling. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of the Interior found in a 1986 survey that 58.5 million citizens call themselves fishermen. In 1962 only 13 million people fished for fun. In proclaiming June 6-12 National Fishing Week, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Fishing greatly aids our economy, it is a source of healthful food, promotes respect for sound conservation and for the bounty and wonder of our natural resources, and introduces millions of people to the benefits of outdoor recreation.'' The Sports Fishing Institute, founded by tackle manufacturers in 1949, estimates Americans spend $ 28.2 billion a year on the hobby. About 750,000 jobs either directly or peripherally depend on it. Industry experts agree fly fishing is especially popular among Baby Boomers who have more money and time to commune with nature. `` It's an ethical sport that's caught the imagination of younger people,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON>, executive director of Trout Unlimited, a 55,000-member organization devoted to enjoying and improving cold-water fisheries. <PERSON> Herbst </PERSON> said the sport seemed to `` attract the hard-driving young executives because it involves a little intellect, it's more than just dangling a worm in a body of water.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbauer </PERSON>, editor of the Orvis News, a newsletter published by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest mail-order company, goes fly-fishing on his lunch hour. `` The people here in the office fish before work and after work,'' said <PERSON> Rosenbauer </PERSON>, who is based at <LOCATION> Orvis </LOCATION>' headquarters in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` There are three or four little brook trout streams right in the middle of town that fish very well at noon on a size 14 Yellow Humpy.'' He said that in the past 15 years there had been a steady 10 percent to 15 percent growth in <LOCATION> Orvis </LOCATION>' fly-fishing equipment business. `` Then last year there was a 50 percent-plus jump in our tackle sales,'' <PERSON> Rosenbauer </PERSON> said. `` Our fly-fishing schools now fill up with waiting lists. I think the boom everybody's been predicting for the past decade is here.'' In the West, fly fishing is a vital and growing part of state economies heavily dependent on tourism. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which have depressed agricultural and natural resource sectors, compete against each other for the big bucks brought in by vacationing anglers. The growing dependence of tourism dollars on prime fish habitat has engendered a debate over the merits of stocking blue ribbon cold-water streams and lakes with hatchery-raised fish.

 In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, thousands of miles of water flow through the 729 million acres of public lands. Each state's water law varies, but generally the people have access to all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s navigable streams, unlike in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> where almost all sports waters are privately owned `` Fishing regulations are still evolving from colonial times, when we rejected the English ways but created a vacuum,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schullery </PERSON>, an associate editor of Country Journal in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Over the years the laws have become enormously tangled. The catch and release philosophy only started about 50 years ago. The hatchery approach is increasingly under fire, especially by fly fishermen who put a higher aesthetic value on wild trout.'' Until the Civil War, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s rivers and streams were chock full of wild fish. `` A guy could take home a hundred trout from one day's fishing, go back and do it again the next day, and nobody noticed,'' said <PERSON> Schullery </PERSON>. `` After the war there was an explosion in recreation and travel with expansion of the railroads. The country grew up, and growing access to the nation's waters began emptying the streams of fish. `` People realized they had to do something about it and the natural course was to begin stocking them with hatchery supplies. In a lot of places there would have been no fish left without hatchery fish, but now it's a big bureaucracy.'' Hard-core fly fishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, claiming that only wild ones are tough fighters with pretty rainbow-colored scales and have a firm texture and pink tint to their flesh. Besides, they say, fish raised on hatchery chow taste mushy. Defenders counter that without the government's extensive stocking efforts, thousands of anglers would never experience the thrill of landing a fish at all. Many New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states, as well as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, have long supported sports fisheries with public money, a financial commitment that migrated slowly westward with the population. Since 1950, federal money also has been earmarked to improve and maintain fish habitats, upgrade fishing and boating access and conduct research. In 1984, the Wallop-Breaux Fund, named after Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, R-Wyo., and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., who introduced the measure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, quadrupled the amount returning to the The money comes from taxes on tackle, motors, boat fuel and import duties on sports fishing equipment and pleasure craft. This year <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will give back through state fish and game departments more than $ 155 million in user fees to improve hobby fishing. The funds are distributed on the basis of land and water area and the number of fishing licenses issued by each state. The 1986 Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> survey indicated 6.4 million Americans were fly fishermen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, editor of Fly Fisherman magazine, estimates 500,000 of those are hard-core anglers, with another million described as `` serious.'' The rest are presumed to play at it. Trout Unlimited has 450 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chapters and is affiliated with groups in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Its stated mission is to `` protect and enhance the cold-water fishery of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In the past four years it has spent $ 700,000 on 135 projects to improve fish habitat and water conservation. The `` Embrace-A-Stream'' program, which aims to get local communities involved in improving their own natural resources, has been hailed as innovative and effective. But lately TU has been casting its organizational net farther afield. Last year it signed two agreements with the Union of Hunting and Fishing, a 2.7 million-member group which controls 85 percent of all land and water resources in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. TU said the agreements call for exchanging research and management programs, technical assistance and sportsmen. TU reports the Soviets and Americans are working out details to allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anglers to fish for arctic char in Siberian waters and visit rivers running into the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where 40-pound brown trout lie in wait. In 1987, a small <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation fished <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> waters. Union chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulitin </PERSON> said: `` We should put <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> together in a bass boat and spread the papers out on the bottom. Then things would be better.'' For as President <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> once said: `` Fishing ... brings meekness and inspiration, reduces our egotism, soothes our troubles and shames our wickedness. It is discipline in the equality of men _ for all men are equal before fish.''

 From the flat high desert of western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> a traveler looks far back over his shoulder to see distant white clouds high in the northeastern sky. But what seems to be clouds are actually peaks that soar 13,000 feet high and straddle the Continental Divide for 120 miles. They are the <LOCATION> Wind </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> mountains, and no one knows them better than <PERSON> Finis </PERSON> -LRB- rhymes with highness -RRB- <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. At 87, he is one of the few living Americans to have a physical landmark _ 12,482-foot <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> _ named after him by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. It was the government's way of thanking him for helping it correct topographical maps. He has a near-perfect memory of the 2 -LCB- million acres of the Wind Rivers public patrimony. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> earned the sobriquet `` Lord of the Winds'' by hiking 15,000 miles, climbing 276 peaks -LRB- some two dozen times -RRB- and amassing more than 100,000 color slides of what he calls `` my back yard.'' He also is responsible for some of the finest fishing in the world. Along with his wife, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON>, his father and brother, and a string of pack horses, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> stocked 314 of the 4,000 lakes in the Wind Rivers a half century ago. From those, the fish migrated to 700 others in the chain. Steep waterfalls and hostile terrain had previously kept them barren of fish since their creation. `` These waters were all virgin and were just full of water lice, leeches, freshwater shrimp ... so those fish just gorged themselves,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> wrote in his book `` Wind River Trails.'' `` Some of the brook trout weighed 3 pounds the third year.'' Today the Wind River Range is one of the finest high-altitude fisheries anywhere. In 1906, when <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s daddy traded 40 acres in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> for 160 acres at the foot of the Wind Rivers, the family moved west in a boxcar with a wagon, two mules, a cow, a dog and a few household treasures. They arrived in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> on April 26 and headed north only to find their new land was worthless. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s father started hauling freight at a penny a pound to feed his family, and 5-year-old <PERSON> Finis </PERSON> helped out. From then on, his life was a great adventure centered in the <LOCATION> Wind </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> mountains. `` The cutthroat trout were the only fish in the Wind Rivers,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` They weighed about 12 pounds apiece. There were no fish in the lakes unless somebody put them there. We think sheepherders may have packed a few fish up there to have something to eat.'' As a young man <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> explored the mountains every chance he got, but after marrying in 1925 he settled down in <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to work for the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. In 1930, the Great Depression cost him his job and the couple took their chances living off the land after a bank failure wiped out their savings. `` A hide buyer took us and all our stuff up into the mountains,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> recalled. `` I had 15 $ 20 bills. Two went to the hide buyer and we were on our own. `` We followed a wagon track left over from the sheepmen's and cattlemen's war of'03. When we got settled we decided to open a fishing camp. We asked the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for a permit and they said fine. We were the only ones doing it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> cooked meals for 50 cents apiece, her husband borrowed 10 horses from friends and charged $ 1.50 a day to rent them to fishermen. Soon folks from <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> were coming up to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Fishing Camp for some badly needed fun in those hard times. `` Only Big <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, Dad's, and a couple other lakes had fish in them when we got started,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. On their own, the <ORGANIZATION> Mitchells </ORGANIZATION> began stocking more. When Superintendent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> of the nearby <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatchery </PERSON> heard about it, he came to see them. `` He said to me, ` <PERSON> Finis </PERSON>, if you're going to run a fishing camp you ought to stock other lakes, too. We do n't have any money, but we'll bring you the fish free if you'll pack'em into the mountains,''' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> recalled. <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>'s hatchery was less than a decade old when he struck his deal with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. The state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> provided a three-room log cabin for the superintendent, the hired hand and his wife, and their six children. Today the hatchery uses trucks with oxygen tanks and elaborate cooling systems, as well as helicopters, to haul fish to lakes and streams. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON>'s methods of transportion were more primitive. `` In the old days we used 5-gallon milk cans, a dozen at a time,'' he said. `` The fish were an inch long and there were 1,000 in a can. We covered the tops of the cans with burlap and steadied them by putting them in wooden apple crates which we tied to pack horses.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s job was to walk the horses around in circles as they arrived from the hatchery. That was to keep the water splashing inside the cans, distributing oxygen to the fish and keeping them from smothering. `` The men would all go inside our camp tent and eat and leave me outside walking those pack animals,'' she said, recalling those days with good humor. In 1939, the railroad recalled <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. When the couple broke camp and left the Wind Rivers to return to <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, they were $ 4,000 in debt. But, for free, they'd stocked 2.5 million cutthroat, rainbow, in many isolated lakes every trout caught by a happy angler is directly descended from the ones <PERSON> Finis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> packed in 50 years ago. `` Trout multiplied into the millions, only to reach weights of 4 to 12 pounds and then die without seeing a single hook,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> wrote in his book, a small guide to the mountains which he sells through mail order from his home. <PERSON> Finis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> walks with the help of two sturdy sticks now, but his aging legs have n't kept him from going to the mountains every summer. He's been honored by his state with an honorary doctorate of law, and by his nation when the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> gave him its outstanding achievement award. But his biggest thrills still come in the Wind Rivers, walking with young people. `` Children ask me who owns the mountains and I'm happy to tell them ` You own it,''' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` It's true, too.'' To remind Americans of their stewardship, he writes in every copy of his book: `` This is your wilderness. `` Take only pictures, `` Leave only footprints, `` Kill nothing but time.''

 Tucked away in a corner of the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> store, across the room from a lunch counter surrounded by a covey of good ol' boys drinking six cups of coffee on one quarter, sits owner <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavrakis </PERSON>. When he is n't selling fishing licenses or tackle, or swapping lies with the coffee drinkers, he's holding court at the little table littered with beautiful bits of fur and feathers. Without looking up from his flying fingers, <PERSON> Mavrakis </PERSON> keeps up a running commentary about great fish he's known, famous people he's guided and the merits of one trout stream over another But it's not the colorful stories of visiting with Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> or fishing with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON> that keep his audience enthralled: It's his flashing fingers. Mavrakis is one of the West's best artificial fly tiers. Every fly he sells in his store, located in the heart of some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best fishing country, is hand-tied. And like thousands of other fishermen who've channeled their summertime love of fly fishing into wintertime fly tying, he needs very specific materials to create fake critters to lure trout straight out of a river and onto a hook. Without realizing it, <PERSON> Mavrakis </PERSON>, like fly tiers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tasmania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, and all points in between, is largely dependent on three men. They are a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> elk hide tanner, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> cotton spinner and a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> chicken farmer. Together they form the tripod of international fly tying because they provide nearly all the commercial raw materials needed to practice the art. Each stumbled into the lucrative business by accident. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennerk </PERSON>, owner of Rocky Mountain Dubbing in <LOCATION> Riverton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, was a hide tanner whose clientele dropped off because of his state's depressed economy. He now provides nearly all the wild animal hair used by foreign factories to manufacture the bulk of ready-made artificial flies. `` I export to 16 countries and have been named this year's Wyoming Exporter of the Year,'' said <PERSON> Kennerk </PERSON>, whose tanning techniques are self-taught and secret `` Last year I had gross sales of $ 225,000, with 90 percent of my business now concentrated in providing hair for flies. It's growing about 40 percent a year.'' He has a new catalog listing the 26 colors of the animal hair he tans and dyes, including caribou, Australian possum, deer, elk, moose and rabbit. Caught by surprise at the success of what started in 1981 as a sideline, <PERSON> Kennerk </PERSON> now has five full-time employees and pays 16 mentally handicapped youngsters to bag and label his products. He also buys hides from local hunters who pump that money back into <LOCATION> Riverton </LOCATION>, and is doubling the size of his building. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Danville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chenille </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been in business 55 years. It began by providing chenille _ a cotton yarn twisted together around a hard core _ for ladies' hats and handbags. But fashions changed and in the late 1950s, when <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>'s family bought the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> firm, its product was popular mainly with hobbyists. Most chenille was then sold for novelty items, such as pipe cleaners. Recently the boom in fly tying has created a whole new market for chenille, which forms the body of the fly. <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>'s company is now the world's major supplier of the product named after the French word for caterpillar. `` We grossed $ 550,000 last year, with all but $ 50,000 of that from our fish and tackle business,'' said <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON>, who employs 11 full-time and five part-time workers. `` We have so many orders it's going like crazy around here. One-third of our sales are to fly factories in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, and to people in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> _ all over.'' Buck <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>'s chicken hatchery in <LOCATION> Bellville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, anchors the third corner of the raw materials triangle. His father, grandfather and uncle started the chicken farm in the late 1930s. `` It was a commercial poultry operation. We raised chickens for meat and eggs,'' said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, who now runs the hatchery with his brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` We got into providing specialty neck feathers because I needed them to tie my own flies and they were very hard to come by. Before us, most of the hackles came hit-and-miss from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> bought his first specialty chickens in 1972 from breeds that had been genetically modified to produce unique neck feathers. `` My dad thought I was crazy when I paid $ 10,000 for 150 chickens,'' he said. Last year that division of the family business took in nearly $ 1.5 million, while the farm's regular chicken and egg sales totaled $ 3 million. `` I realized within two years that there was an unknown level of demand out there for our hackle production,'' said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, referring to the prized neck feathers of his pedigreed poultry. `` We've been trying ever since to find out how big the market is, but it keeps growing faster than we can keep up with it. `` We have 35 distributors in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as well as here, and we're far and away the largest feather supplier to fly tiers in the world.'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> now employs 60 full-time and 60 part-time workers to give his 100,000 pampered chickens the individual care they require. `` These are somewhat delicate birds, prone to diseases more than commercial strains of poultry, and each one has to be individually caged to protect them from each other,'' he said. <PERSON> Kennerk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> all know about each other and their importance to fly tiers. They have another thing in common: They're avid fly fishermen who're now so busy working they do n't have time to go fishing anymore.

 Actress <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>, making a return engagement as hostess for tonight's `` 1988 Tony Awards,'' wants to get back to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> where she collected her share of the prizes in earlier years. `` I think there's an electricity that takes place in the theater and nowhere else but in the theater,'' says <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON>, familiar to TV audiences as <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> on `` Murder, She Wrote.'' `` It makes you want to get back to it. Applause, applause, you know. It's meat and potatoes to us.'' Three musicals received 10 nominations for Tonys, which go to the best of Broadway from the season just ending. They're <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>'s `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>'s `` Into the Woods'' and a revival of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Anything Goes. The CBS producers of the awards presentations, which will be televised from Broadway's Minskoff Theater, invited Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> back for a second year as hostess. `` Last year, it intrigued and honored me enough that I felt I had to host it,'' Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> said by telephone from her home in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` Through my connection with ` Murder, She Wrote,' I knew I was going to be welcome in the nation's living rooms. Some people saw me glamorously gowned for the first time.'' Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> became known in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> at 17, became a star on Broadway at 40 in `` Mame,'' and became a TV star at 59, as <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who writes and solves mysteries. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her first movie, `` Gaslight,'' and twice more, for `` The Picture of Dorian Gray'' and `` The Manchurian Candidate,'' where she played <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s mother. She also played <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s mother in `` Blue <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'' and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s sister in `` National Velvet.'' On Broadway, she was in only three shows, `` Hotel Paradiso,'' `` A Taste of Honey'' and `` Anyone Can Whistle,'' before she started winning Tonys. She has Tonys for the musicals `` Mame,'' `` Dear World,'' `` Gypsy'' and `` <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>.'' About her gown for this year's show, Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> says, `` That's a prime concern for a woman. We're going to try to outdo ourselves this year.'' Last year she appeared first in a gown of dramatically contrasting panels of black and white and later wore glittering gold. `` I'm lucky enough to be gowned by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackie </PERSON>, a great <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> designer,'' she says. `` He created one of the most stunning gowns I've ever seen last year _ the black-and-white creation. `` It's such a great dress I can not let it hang in a bag in a closet. I'm sure it will go into one of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> museums _ if I can keep it away from my granddaughter. She's a big dresser-upper. She's only 3. `` My son _ her father _ is director <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. He directed a lot of ` Murder, She Wrote,' which is very nice. My daughter has a restaurant with her husband in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.'' Another concern is the strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Last year, a tremendous amount of what I did say was me,'' she says. `` I told them I did n't want to get up there and spout a lot of things I would n't be comfortable saying. I wanted to talk from the heart. `` This year, I do n't know how they'll script. With everything that has been written about the shows, it would be possible for me to put together anything that's needed. If necessary, that's what I'll do.'' Earlier in May, the 62-year-old actress made an exercise and lifestyle tape. `` It's how to keep your body moving, light and graceful and how to keep your energy up,'' she says. `` I throw in all sorts of homilies about rest and exercise and how to get the most out of life.'' This season's `` Murder, She Wrote'' series kept her working long hours from last July 5 to early May, Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> says. `` We shot 25 episodes. Normally we do 22. We had the scripts so we decided we'd go ahead, so we'd have something to start the new season with. We hope to start back Aug. 1. We have no way of knowing. We're in the midst of this dreadful strike. People are rather grim about it.'' At the end of next season, Miss <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> says, `` My five-year stint on ` Murder, She Wrote' will be over. I can not stay, on a week-to-week basis. Perhaps we can work out an arrangement where I do several a year, which would leave me free to do other things. That's what I want. `` Especially when you get up in my years, if you're still energetic, which I am, and still love working in the theater, movies and TV, you want to feel you've got some time to do it. I really think I'm one of the luckiest people on two feet. I do have tremendous stamina and energy.''

<HEAD>Soviets Clear Forest to Build New Town for Chernobyl Workers</HEAD>

 In what once was an evergreen forest, thousands of workers are building a new town with stores, apartments and houses for 30,000 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant workers and their families. But those coming and going to work at <ORGANIZATION> Chernobyl </ORGANIZATION> 30 miles to the west will have to pass first through a long metal building filled with rows of gray lockers and sensors with green and red lights. In the building by the railroad tracks, the sensors will check the workers for radioactive contamination. The lockers will hold their work clothes. `` Every person much be checked,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasenko </PERSON>, deputy director of the Kombinat agency that oversees the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> plant and the area surrounding it. More than 135,000 people were evacuated from the zone around the nuclear plant after the explosion and fire April 26, 1986, at Chernobyl's No. 4 reactor. At least 31 people were killed and a cloud of radioactive material eventually circled the globe. <LOCATION> Pripyat </LOCATION>, once a city of 50,000 within sight of the Chernobyl's towering stacks, has become a nuclear ghost town Its nine-story apartment buildings stand empty, lamps with various colored shades remain in the window of a department store and spindly weeds grow on the light-brown dirt brought in to replace the contaminated soil that was scraped off and buried. The Chernobyl plant's 4,400 workers and their families were hastily removed by a fleet of more than 1,000 buses and scattered to new homes in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chernigov </PERSON> and cities of southern <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>. But later this year, if they want to continue to work at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, they will have to move to <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>. Each Soviet nuclear power plant requires its personnel to live together in one city. The few hundred people who began moving into <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION> in March are checked for radiation every time they travel to and from the plant. One sensor checks them when they enter the long metal building. They pick up their work clothes from their lockers, walk through an open area to another sensor where they stand with their hands held high, change their clothes and then walk out past a third sensor to the train that will take them to work. When construction is finished, shuttle trains will take the workers to their jobs at the nuclear power station in 34 minutes, officials said on a recent press tour. The officials said the area was slightly contaminated by fallout from the Chernobyl accident, but it poses no danger now for the new settlers. The few residents on hand for the press tour agreed. `` I think everything is all right,'' said teacher <PERSON> Lyudmila </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabarina </PERSON>, who has two young children. `` I do n't think it's dangerous. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, young electricians from nearby <PERSON> Chernigov </PERSON> now living temporarily in metal barracks in the nearby village of <LOCATION> Lesnoi </LOCATION>, said they were convinced the area was safe. Mayor <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankov </PERSON> said Soviet authorities ordered the construction of the new town in October 1986, and set aside 650 acres of land and 426 million rubles -LRB- $ 680 million -RRB- for the construction. <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, in the northern <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> where it meets <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, is being built by teams of workers from eight of the 15 Soviet republics. Estonian builders have put up small, dark brown wooden houses. Houses built by the Latvians are of red brick. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> builders have put up large apartment complexes around remaining wooded areas. One kindergarten is finished, as is the school that will take an estimated 1,200 students aged 6 to 17 in the fall. Mrs. <PERSON> Zabarina </PERSON>, an English teacher, said the school opened this spring with about a dozen teachers and 60 students. Basic food industries also will be built, and their workers will also live in <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, officials said. But right now, the roads are unpaved, few buildings are finished and fewer are inhabited. Soviet workers are accustomed to such rush projects, which have been a part of the economy for decades. In the rapid industrialization beginning in the early 1930s, whole cities were built in short spans of time for workers at the huge factories. Many such cities were poorly built, but the new residents of <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION> expect their city to be different. Mrs. <PERSON> Zabarina </PERSON>, whose husband works as an organizer for the Communist youth organization, said their previous town offered none of the cultural or sporting facilities of her new home. `` I'm amazed,'' she said. `` It will be a beautiful city.''

 From the gilded splendor of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> reception halls to a mock-Western hotel frequented by foreign businessmen and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> prostitutes, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s busiest landmarks are being pressed into service for this week's U.S.-Soviet summit. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, hundreds of staff workers and thousands of journalists will occupy just a few buildings in the city, but their presence will be dominating. The official meetings will take place in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, seat of Soviet power. And although they do n't live within the fortress walls, the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> will give a state dinner there for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, who will be hosts for a reciprocal affair at their summit quarters, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence known as <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The official American entourage and much of the White House press accompanying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be housed at the Mezhdunarodnaya -LRB- International -RRB- Hotel attached to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Center for International Trade. The hotel also will serve as headquarters for an international press corps now estimated to number at least 5,000. Many of the visiting journalists will stay at the mammoth 3,200-room Rossiya Hotel between Red Square and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, although officials have said some outlying hotels also will be used to handle the flood of reporters, photographers and technicians. Here are historical notes and descriptions of the principal summit venues:

<HEAD>THE KREMLIN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The delta-shaped fortress that today encloses the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership behind russet, crenelated walls dates back to the 15th century at the site of a former `` White Stone'' Kremlin. Inside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> walls, bordered by the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, Red Square and the Alexander Gardens that run along bustling <PERSON> Prospekt </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, are a jumble of czarist palaces, cathedrals, government buildings and state museums, including the Armory, which houses Faberge eggs, gold, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great's high boots and other Kremlin treasures and memorabilia. The leaders will likely meet at some time during the summit in the rose-and-silver-colored Hall of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, a 19th century remnant of the Russo-Byzantine-style Imperial residence that is now the Grand Kremlin Palace. The most stringent security measures in a capital known for caution are practiced at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, where the three main gates are manned by dozens of uniformed <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> border guards and access even to the roads leading up to the gates is restricted. During the meetings and festivities connected with the summit, the broad stretches of asphalt and cobblestone between the historic buildings will be black with freshly polished ZIL limousines used to shuttle Soviet dignitaries, as well as the American vehicles that will be flown in for use by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his senior staff.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SPASO HOUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The yellow New Empire-style mansion, which takes its name from the small <LOCATION> Spasopeskovskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> out front and a nearby Russian Orthodox cathedral, will house <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, and their personal staff during their five-day stay in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will stay in the second-floor guest quarters that had been known as the Vice Presidential Suite but will be renamed in honor of its new guests, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy press attache <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, plan to stay in their own quarters in the mansion for the presidential visit. <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a two-story dwelling with a columned front portico, was built in 1914 on the grounds inhabited in the 17th century by the czar's dog-keepers and falconers. Its wealthy builder, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vtorov </PERSON>, was killed shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and the mansion was expropriated by the Soviet government. It was turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1933, when <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullitt </PERSON> arrived as the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The mansion and its surrounding gardens have been the scene of raucous celebrations such as the one on Christmas Eve 1934, recalled in <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>'s book `` Bears in the Caviar,'' when animals borrowed from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Zoo went beserk in the ballroom. Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> attended lawn parties there when he was still in power. In World War II, a bomb shelter was built in the mansion's basement, and the ambassador and his staff evacuated to the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kuibyshev </LOCATION> in late 1941 when German troops drew close to the city and air raids broke an occasional window The vaulted ceilings and doric columns that distinguish the interior are complimented by cream, navy and mauve furnishings. A collection of ultra-modern art, chosen by the Matlocks, hangs on the marble walls as part of the `` Art in Embassies'' program.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEZHDUNARODNAYA HOTEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The modern, slate-gray towers of the American-designed hotel and business complex known among foreigners as `` The Mezh'' is an island of Western life that is for the most part off-limits to Soviet citizens. The Mezh, derived from the Russian word `` mezhdunarodnaya,'' meaning international, is so different from most Soviet business and residential buildings that filmmakers use the interior to portray American venues. In the 1985 film `` We Accuse,'' about the U-2 spy plane s news agency says 5,000 reporters have sought accreditation for the summit, and the White House and Soviet Foreign Ministry agreed the second-floor <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> was the only place in the city that could accommodate a press center. Even so, it will seat fewer than 1,000 of those expected.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE ROSSIYA HOTEL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Twice ravaged by fire, the 5,500-bed <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> will serve as home and office for the world's broadcast media. Television and radio teams have built studio sets on the west-wing balconies overlooking Red Square and the Kremlim, from which the nightly news on all four American networks will be anchored. The 12-story hotel, which took 25 years of haggling, design change and behind-the-scenes debate to complete, opened its first rooms in late 1966 and was completed in 1971. It has restaurants, six bars, a film theater and a concert hall. Fire struck the north wing Feb. 25, 1977, and at least 30 people were killed. An exploding television set in one of the rooms was blamed for a Jan. 8, 1987, blaze that killed one woman. The hotel's location near the most popular sights of the Soviet capital has made it a favorite with tourists for the past 20 years. The familiar onion domes of St. Basil's Cathedral and a half-dozen small churches relocated to the site during construction projects around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stand in stark contrast to the modern steel, glass and concrete Rossiya. To the north is the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION>, GUM, and across Red Square are Spassky Tower, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall burial ground and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s red-marble mausoleum.

<TEXT>
 Every evening around 7, the thudding, rumbling and clashing that have filled the convention center for 11 -LCB- hours suddenly cease. For 15 minutes, there's silence. Then the organ swells. Spectators cheer. Gold curtains snap open. And 200 bowlers, their faces flushed with pride and embarrassment, march up the center aisle, flanked by 20 gleaming bowling alleys. Uh, strike that. We do n't use `` alley'' anymore. And hey! Get your mind out of the gutter. Take it from the American Bowling Congress: `` Gutter'' is out. `` Channel'' is in. Ask <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON> and you get a different opinion. `` A gutter's a gutter,'' says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, better known as 33-year-old <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Haemmerle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Chosen at random to represent bowlers everywhere, he was crowned Feb. 13, opening day of the 85th annual <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> tournament that ended in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> last week. Question: How long does it take 38,000 bowlers from 50 states and nine foreign countries bowling 18 hours a day, seven days a week, to bowl 341,430 games, thereby toppling 58 million pins? Answer: 103 days, which is about 102 longer than it takes to realize that bowling is experiencing an identity crisis. Gutter or channel? Recreation or sport? <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>? Do n't be fooled by the plastic bowler-in-a-seashell, the `` beer frame'' keychains and other doo-dads for sale at the tournament. Out on the lanes, bowling's taking the high road: No smoking. No shorts. No collarless shirts. No drinking. NO HOT DOGS. You're here to bowl, not to eat. What's gotten into bowling? Where'd all that high-tech equipment come from? A black rubber ball in a zippered bag was good enough for <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON>. Today, it's three, four, five balls. Rubber balls. Urethane balls. Polyester balls. In purple. Blue. YELLOW, for heaven's sake. Carried in _ are you ready for this, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>? _ battery-heated, insulated, temperature-controlled bowling bags. Behold the modern bowling pin: Laminated on the outside, holes on the inside. The slightest tap and it's to the moon, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>! Consider the lane: Spread a little oil on today's urethane-coated surfaces and it's bang, zoom To the pocket, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>! `` Nah, I do n't practice,'' says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON>. `` If you're not hitting your shot, you just buy another ball. I carry five of the urethanes.'' Alas, five are n't always enough. In his first official act, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON> opened the tournament with a gutterball. What do you want from a guy forced to bowl in front of 2,234 people while wearing a robe and a crown? Bowling's split personality begins to make sense when you consider that there's bowling the sport, and then there's bowling the game. Bowling the sport is math, physics and sophisticated terms like `` coefficient of friction'' and `` kinetic energy.'' Bowling the game is nachos, chili dogs and simple terms like `` Miller'' and `` Bud.'' Unlike the sport, the game has no image problem. It could n't care less, an attitude that irks the sport no end Let the sport compile all those demographics about how young-bright-affluent its 68 million participants are. Let it lie awake nights worrying about the impression it makes. The game has better things to do, like order another cheeseburger. The American Bowling Congress, gatekeeper of the sport and recipient of $ 10 million in dues from 3.4 million league bowlers, stresses skill, complexity, pride and tradition. The National Bowling Council, the industry's advertising arm, and <ORGANIZATION> AMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>, its largest manufacturers, stress leisure, recreation and fun, fun, fun. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, a 9-year-old who pushed his bowling ball two-handed to a near-perfect 299, was immortalized in the early'80s in a <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> ad promoting easy-to-topple pins. In the same era, the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> put an orangutan on the cover of its magazine, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> enthusiastically promoted a `` Real People'' segment featuring a bowling pig. Fun for all ages! Anyone can play! You do n't have to be good. You do n't have to be a grown-up. You do n't even have to be human! Bowling's critics say it's going to the dogs. Its kingpins say it's going to the Olympics. What's a swell game like bowling doing in a mess like this? It did n't get there overnight. The ancient Egyptians were bowlers; it's been traced back to 5200 BC. Germans bowled in the 6th century; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> in the 16th. In those days, the game was called ninepins, `` lawn bowling'' in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> banned it as `` a form of vicious gambling.'' No respect, even then. Lawn bowling and `` skittles,'' a Dutch game, got a warm welcome in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION>, where tavern owners embraced them as a way to boost beer sales. It did n't take long for gambling charges to resurface. Prim and proper <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> banned ninepins in the late 1830s. That might have been the end of that, had not some enterprising soul _ evidence points to one <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> _ circumvented the law by adding a 10th pin. Bowling was legalized in 1841. Like other German immigrants, bowling headed West in the 19th century. It settled in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, still bowling's stronghold with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> No. 1. Bowling generally thrives wherever blue-collar and shift workers are found. `` If you work from 7 to 5, you do n't have time for daylight sports like golf or tennis. Bowling is something you can do at night,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, a bowler who owns a pizzeria in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Almost from the beginning, would-be bureaucrats descended on bowling, bent on organizing, standardizing and merchandizing what was, until the late 1800s, a haphazard affair involving however many pins of whatever shapes and sizes happened to be on hand. That all changed in 1895, when the American Bowling Congress first met, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Formed to represent bowlers' interests, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> quickly adopted the 300-point scoring system and set uniform standards for pins, balls and lanes. And what did it get for its trouble? It got trouble. The bickering started almost immediately: High scores vs. high standards. Commercial interests vs. bowler interests. Sport vs. game. Bad press dogged bowling from the beginning -LRB- Ever read `` Rip van <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>?'' -RRB-, only to be replaced many years later by something infinitely worse: no press at all. Legislators picked on bowling. In some states, it was illegal for minors to walk to or from a bowling alley unless accompanied by an adult. Those laws were repealed in the 1950s. By that time, bowling had reached new heights of respectability. The glamorous beer teams, touring the country in their all-white, good-guy outfits, helped boost bowling's image, along with sales of <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s, Falstaff, Budweiser and <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>. Automatic pin-spotters brought respectability, just as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was about to crack down on the low pay and late hours given erstwhile pinboys. And women developed an affinity for the game, prompting proprietors to class up the joints. As <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> went, so went the nation. Between the mid'40s and the mid'60s, the number of league bowlers quadrupled. Suddenly, everyone was going bowling _ 4.5 million people regularly, in ABC-sanctioned leagues.

<TEXT>
 From 1955 to 1960, membership in the Women's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rose by 150 percent. Entrepreneurs were quick to spring into action. A little too much action, it turned out. In 1944, there were 38,203 bowling lanes. By 1964, there were 159,079. So ended `` The Competitive Era'' of bowling. So began `` The Commercial Era.'' So says Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a former college professor with four decades of involvement in bowling and a Ph.D. in finance. He's also the author of two scholarly volumes on industry trends that combine a desire to drag bowling's leaders behind the woodshed with a penchant for capital letters. `` NO INDUSTRY OR ORGANIZATION HAS AN INHERENT RIGHT TO EXIST FOREVER,'' he writes. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> considers bowling a sport, and he'd like you to. Actually, what he'd really like is for you to consider it `` a microcosm of life itself,'' but what the heck. He's a reasonable guy. Besides, this is no time to argue. `` Bowling,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> warns, `` is on the verge of extinction,'' done in by bouncy pins and urethane balls with built-in hooking power, unscrupulous lane conditions and greedy commercial interests. If it's true that the sport of bowling is dying, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> thinks the business of bowling is what's killing it. `` We have eroded the integrity of the SPORT of bowling to create the RECREATION of bowling,'' according to the text of a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proprietors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Meanwhile, recreational bowlers are scoring up a storm. The same 213 average that made one Detroiter the highest-ranked bowler in his league in 1987 puts him between 50th and 60th on this year's roster. Consider the perfect game: 12 strikes, for a score of 300, once so rare that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> gave a 14-carat gold ring to anyone who managed to pull it off. Today, the same ring costs a bowler $ 350. The free ones are silver-plated _ a good thing for the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, considering the number of perfect games bowled last year: 8,537, up from 1,375 a decade ago. Honor scores in general _ 300, 299 or 298 for a single game or 800 for a three-game series _ totaled 21,022 for 1987, exceeding the totals for 1977, 1978 and 1979 combined. During a single day of competition at a tournament in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, in April, there were four perfect games. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, who works the counter at <LOCATION> Bowl-Era </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanes </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, still remembers the excitement of the center's first 300 game. `` It was a big day. Of course, that was five years ago. So far this year, we've had six.'' At <LOCATION> Bowl-Era </LOCATION>, `` 180 used to be considered a high average. Now we're seeing 225 averages. Last year, my own family brought home 16 trophies. Finally, I told them, ` Enough!''' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has had enough, too. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is a self-appointed guardian of the sport's integrity _ what's left of it, anyway. He'd sooner lock bowling in its room than let it strut its stuff as scheduled in a one-day exhibition the day before opening ceremonies at the summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` Bowling is not going to any parties until it cleans itself up,'' vows <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a former pro coach who now manufactures his own line of `` honest'' pins and lane finishes, products he insists would solve the whole problem. Products he claims the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> refuses to approve. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> says he's never asked. Bowling, says <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, `` has become a low-life game. A 24-year-old with a 227 average just bowled his 14th career 300 game. If the great bowlers of the past were here instead of in their graves, they would shoot him. `` A bowling lane today is the equivalent of a concave golf green with a 36-inch cup,'' contends <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who, using a speed trap of his own invention, recently clocked a bowling pin at 42 feet per second. `` In the old days, they traveled 16 feet, 17 feet per second. Now they're flying all over the deck.'' Next to bouncy pins, nothing makes <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> madder than `` blocked'' lanes. Oil is applied to bowling lanes to protect them from the friction of the landing ball as well as to provide a `` skid'' area, thereby enabling the ball to follow the `` skid-roll-hook'' pattern required for effective delivery. How to apply that protective coating is infinitely more complicated. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> believes _ and he has lots of company _ that less-than-scrupulous bowling centers have `` learned how to place oil on the lanes to reguide errant shots into the pocket. This lane blocking, along with today's powerful balls, has made bad bowlers appear good. We have horrible bowlers now.'' Not so, says <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bowling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proprietors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Fairlanes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 4,000 lanes, more than any other chain. `` What we have today is an extremely skilled sport. Technical improvements may well have helped. But I do not agree that today's bowlers are n't as good `` Some proprietors _ not the majority, but a few _ are using oil as a marketing strategy,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> concedes. `` But the average bowler is n't able to exploit those conditions.'' The oil crisis has been under closer scrutiny than <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> by the ever-vigilant <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, whose previous efforts to resolve it have succeeded only in further depleting its stock of honor-score rings. `` We want to see any rule change result in a condition that is fair and competitive to all bowlers, and that will leave the pride of accomplishment in the hands of the bowlers instead of the maintenance people,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary-treasurer <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellermann </PERSON> says through clenched teeth. At the tournament in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, lanes were constantly monitored to ensure the same conditions for each bowler, as well as to prevent lanes from becoming blocked. This meticulous maintenance may have accounted for both the low numbers on the scoreboard and the long faces in the parking lot. `` A lot of people take bowling too seriously,'' confides <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON>, whose mother went bowling the night she gave birth to him. `` Mom was tough. I grew up with, ` Head down! Do n't bend your wrist! Keep your damn shoulder up!' She used to be a killer. Now she's in it for fun.'' For what it's worth, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowler </PERSON> has never done well at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> tournament, either. `` But no matter how bad you do, you always come back.'' Indeed, bowling badly at the championships is an annual tradition, right up there with the march up the center aisle and the crowning of Joe Bowler. Like today's bowling pins, bowlers are mighty resilient. `` Conditions are always rough,'' confirms <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, whose 50th tournament appearance won him a diamond lapel pin and warm applause when he marched up the aisle in April. The organist played `` Over the Rainbow.'' <PERSON> Ahler </PERSON> bowled 177. Like 60 percent of this year's bowlers, he's planning to try again next year, when the tournament moves to <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` It's an impossible tournament,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` But you keep wondering: When's your lucky year gon na come?'' One of these days, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>. One of these days.

 It was only a matter of time before `` The Dirty Dozen'' arrived as a weekly series. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> recently snatched it up, and a cast and crew from <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> is busy re-creating this fantasy version of World War II on location in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. It began as a hit movie in 1967 with an all-star cast, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> revived it three times, once with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> reprising his movie role as the tough, good-guy leader, and twice with <PERSON> Telly </PERSON> <PERSON> Savalas </PERSON>, who played a bad guy in the original movie, as the leader. It's a great concept. Take a bunch of convicted murders, offer them an outside chance of freedom and send them off on a suicide mission against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The bad guys suddenly become the underdogs and capture audience sympathy. Everybody's happy, except the Germans, who reportedly are a little miffed at once again being the patsies in a war film. `` They're the classic underdogs,'' said executive producer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Furia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` They've made mistakes of various kinds and are looking to redeem themselves by heroic action.'' <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> stars in the weekly series, which <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> began running Saturdays last month. He plays Lt. <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, the head of the group. But this time he's also a convicted felon. <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> assaulted a colonel he says was responsible for getting 80 of his men killed in combat. `` <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>'s a no-nonsense career soldier who does n't want to be there but does n't know what else to do,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, also speaking from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` It's sort of the story of my experience. I've never done a series where life imitated art so much. It's like going to war for a year. You leave home, go to another country. `` Our accommodations are better than barracks, but the filmmaking process is very much like being in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. You have periods of hurry up and wait, then periods of intense work. I think it's the toughest show on television in terms of man-hours, hardships and the effort that goes into it.'' <PERSON> Furia </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> is like a big studio backlot because of its old buildings, various architectural styles, cobbled streets and variety of countryside just outside the city. `` There are n't many places left in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that still look like the 1940s,'' said <PERSON> Furia </PERSON>. `` In addition, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has a lot of equipment, military and otherwise, from the period. It's very economical to shoot here. We have an excellent local film crew. `` Our shows are a combination of melodrama, action-adventure and strong characters. We have a good cast and the luxury of being able to tell many different kinds of stories within the framework of the series. We've done stories on teen-age partisans, the Cossacks of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and one that was supposed to be set on an island off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.'' The show also stars <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenney </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiAquino </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. That does n't add up to a dozen, but various guest actors are brought in for each episode. They're usually casualties by the end of the show. `` <PERSON> Danko </PERSON> keeps a certain distance from his men, because of rank and age, but there's also a comraderie,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` He's a 40-year-old lieutenant. I've been in four war movies, and in one 20 years ago I played a lieutenant. I've never gone beyond that in rank. In ` The Winds of War' I was a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he spends his off time playing tennis with his Yugoslavian buddies. `` They have nice courts here,'' he said. `` We found one the other day on an army base. My buddies talked our way in. If I can play tennis a few times a week I have few problems being anywhere.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has become a major film site in recent years. The sequel to `` The Great Escape'' was also filming there. `` War and Remembrance'' had been there earlier. The movie `` High Road to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' and an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries on <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> were also filmed there. `` They make a lot of World War II movies on their own,'' said <PERSON> Furia </PERSON>. `` So they're used to our special effects bombs and the machine guns. We're blowing up so many buildings and trucks I sometimes think we're laying waste to half of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Furia is an old hand at working abroad. In recent years he's produced `` Rage of Angels'' in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, `` The Sun Also Rises'' in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and `` We Are The Children'' in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> `` Dirty Dozen: The Series'' began filming in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> last December and will not complete 13 episodes until July. It takes 10 days to make each episode.

<TEXT>
 On the first weekend of every month, thousands of art lovers take a walk on the wild side through some of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s loveliest farmland. It's the Crocodile Ramble, stretching 28 miles near <LOCATION> Honeydew </LOCATION>, a village in the mink-and-manure belt, so called because of the area's wealthy, horse-keeping inhabitants. Civil servants from government offices in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, businessmen from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and young families getting their first taste of serious art walk and drive along dirt trails, through cow pastures and <PERSON> bush </PERSON>. Artists and craftsmen open their workshops and chat with all comers about form, color and price. Visitors who do n't buy can still enjoy coffee, wine and light lunches. Bands play. Hot-air balloons float overhead. Water sportsmen head for <ORGANIZATION> Hartebeespoort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION>, a nearby lake. Enthusiasts of early humans prowl among the caves at <LOCATION> Sterkfontein </LOCATION>, a few miles away. Zulu tribesmen dance for tourists in a kraal of tree-branch walls set up by a local hotel. Artists have lived for decades in the gentle hills around the <LOCATION> Crocodile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, their thatched houses secluded but still close to showrooms in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The idea of the Ramble came a year ago to potter <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, who specializes in bonsai. `` Art should be accessible to everybody, including people who are frightened of going into a gallery. Children should be confronted with art,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. `` The problem with this society is it's flush and it's plastic. People are susceptible to easy forms of entertainment _ beer, rugby, braais -LRB- cookouts -RRB- and video. It's essential that these things are counterbalanced.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> encouraged some 25 friends to open their studios to the public once a month, creating a vast attraction for both connoisseurs and tourists. Property values soared. Jewelry-maker <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrimgeour </PERSON> bought her farm for $ 90,000 just before the Ramble opened and said it's now worth $ 170,000 Some artists, uncomfortable dealing with the public, dropped out. Others welcomed their freedom from the demands of galleries, which take up to 40 percent of selling prices, and found new customers by taying home. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said he took in $ 2,500 on a recent weekend. In a country where nearly all human endeavors are affected by the prolonged conflict over apartheid, the Ramble remains a non-political patch of Western taste set incongruously in the African countryside. The artists and craftsmen are white, some born in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some incorporate African themes in their work. Others, such as <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, draw on Northern Hemisphere traditions. The only studio devoted to black African art was hit by lightning and burned down in February. The success of white farmers and artists masks poverty among black seasonal farm workers, residents say. Scrimgeour said a 1987 survey by a local church listed 25 percent of black children under 6 years old as dangerously malnourished. She said the Ramble has increased black employment. The Ramble includes <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who charges up to $ 3,500 for his hand-forged knives. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s wife, Sue, paints on silk. Muralist <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korzennik </PERSON> spent decades decorating corporate headquarters before he lost a contract he had pursued for a year. The disappointment made him rethink his life and his art. `` Now I stay here and do what I want, and let people respond,'' he said. His large wood and steel sculptures sell for up to $ 8,000. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatt </PERSON>, a furniture designer, and his wife, <PERSON> Fiona </PERSON>, an interior decorator, opened a gallery of paintings by a friend, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nel </PERSON>, who died three years ago. `` We had about 60 of them and at first we did n't know what to do,'' <PERSON> Yatt </PERSON> said. `` Now they're being sold and when they're all gone, I'm not sure what will happen.'' <PERSON> Sarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> sells unglazed ceramic birds and plant holders and small bronze animals at a farm that's been in her family for 100 years. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Worsley </PERSON> produces rustic furniture. `` I employed 52 people in a two-story factory in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Then a customer brought me to the <LOCATION> Crocodile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and I saw what I was missing _ geese charging around the garden, dogs playing. I had lost out on life. `` I sold my house and almost everything I had and bought a farm here. I became a one-man business again, and have only 10 people working for me now. Living since then has been total bliss.''

 The songs on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolby </PERSON>'s new album bear little resemblance to the synth-pop sound of his biggest hit, `` She Blinded Me With Science,'' and that's just the way he wants it. Every song I've ever written has been different from every other one,'' Dolby says. `` That's one of my rules of thumb. I like to break ground with every song I write.'' `` Aliens Ate My Buick'' is Dolby's third album. With music ranging from reggae to pop to funk, he hopes no one will identify him with a particular sound. `` That can be a terrible trap to fall into,'' he said. `` I am very fortunate to have a wide musical vocabulary. I can use any musical idiom to make a point.'' Dolby, an Englishman who now lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, calls himself a satirist and relates to such musicians as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappa </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, whose song `` Hot Sauce'' appears on `` Aliens.'' Dolby pokes fun at men and women, at Americans and especially at himself. `` The songs are like ` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goes </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,' a journal of an Englishman who goes to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview. The first single is called `` Airhead.'' `` The song is about one specific female from first-hand experience,'' he said. `` The big crime is that the lady behaves like an airhead even though she has a brain.'' Dolby's concern about how women would feel about `` Airhead'' was eased when a friend showed him some lyrics for a song called `` Bonehead.'' `` It's about a guy who wears all the right clothes. I read them and I was in fits of hysterics,'' Dolby said. `` It occurred to me, ` Do I feel insulted as a man by these lyrics?' No. They're not about men, they're about a stereotype. It's making fun of the stereotype. `` The only complaints I've had have been from men.'' Dolby has worked with a number of artists, including <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, Foreigner and <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>. He is intrigued by the idea of producing a relatively new artist. `` I'd really like to take a raw talent like <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arby </PERSON> and mold him. He just does n't have the experience to optimize his talent,'' Dolby said. `` There are a lot of people who are at the top of the strata who are good at optimizing the little talent they have. I'd like to get the opposite side.'' On the `` Aliens'' LP, actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON>'s voice can be heard shouting `` murder'' on `` My Brain Is Like a Sieve.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, the host of television's `` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,'' introduces the album's first song, `` Key to Her Ferrari.'' `` I was looking for a good attitude to begin the album,'' Dolby said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> -RRB- has a production office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for ` Lifestyles' so I sent him a tape and he really liked the song.'' `` Aliens'' was produced by Dolby and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittrell </PERSON>, who worked on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s latest album, `` Bad.'' `` They had a good dozen engineers working on that album,'' said Dolby. `` Everybody said the most creative and sweetest to work with was <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bittrell </PERSON>.'' Dolby's first album, `` The Golden Age of Wireless,'' was released in 1982 and included `` She Blinded Me With Science.'' Dolby toured in 1984 after the release of his second album, `` Flat Earth,'' but had difficulty reproducing the sound from his studio recordings. He does not anticipate that problem when he tours this summer. `` The songs on this album lend themselves a lot more easily to being performed live,'' he said. `` They're a lot more groove-based.'' Dolby will tour with the band he used on `` Aliens.'' Although <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is famous for having big name session players, Dolby auditioned unknown musicians to play on his new album. `` I was looking to find some people with enthusiasm. The LA lifestyle is not conducive to challenging music,'' he said. `` There are a lot of musicians who are technically proficient but do n't seem to do it with that much conviction `` I was determined to turn up some fresh talent. I wanted people who were good players but had some hunger.'' The success of `` She Blinded Me With Science'' was helped considerably by the accompanying video, which received heavy airplay on Music Television. Dolby says he often writes with visual images in mind. `` I'll have a picture in my head from a magazine or a book, sometimes a scene from a movie,'' Dolby said. `` Sometimes I'm already thinking ahead to the videos.

<TEXT>
 As the new kid on the literary block, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> should have plenty of tips for aspiring writers after his first novel earned him a record-breaking $ 155,000 advance. The 24-year-old Wunderkind does n't have any words of wisdom, though. Getting `` The Mysteries of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'' published was just plain luck, he tells fledgling authors somewhat sheepishly. His coming-of-age novel was actually his master's thesis. An unsuspecting <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> turned it in last year to a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, who, instead of critiquing the manuscript, sent it to his agent. The agent was impressed, as was <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which offered $ 155,000 for the hardcover rights. Since its April release, `` The Mysteries of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'' has jumped onto best-seller lists, with 130,000 hardback copies in print. Foreign rights have been sold to editors in 13 countries and bids for the paperback rights are in the six figures. A movie deal also is in the works. The book is about a gangster's mild-mannered son who spends the summer after college graduation with new, flashy friends, including a young woman and man who vie for his affections. The protagonist, like <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON>, attended the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, and the drama unfolds in this city. `` To me, it's the first novel. It has all the weaknesses of first novels. I mean, it's the first time I ever tried to write a book,'' the slim, soft-spoken <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> said on a recent visit here. The pricetag is irrelevant, he said, `` because it seems so inflated to me. I just ca n't correlate it with the worth of the book. All I ever really wanted was just to get my book published, or get a book published.'' Always an avid reader, <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> decided while growing up in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> he was going to become a writer. He honed his talents at <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1984. After living in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> six months, he applied to the two-year writing program at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. He began working on `` The Mysteries of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'' in May 1985 in preparation for graduate school that fall. `` I just thought ... there are going to be all these serious writers there, real writers, and I'll bet they're all working on novels and I've just been doing short stories,'' he recalled. By the time he arrived in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> had written 100 pages, 80 of which he quickly scrapped. Over the next 1 -LCB- years, he spent every evening working on the book, required for his master of fine arts degree. He took his title from `` The Mysteries of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>'' by 19th-century French novelist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>. `` I substituted the word <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and I went, ` Ooooh, neat,''' he said. <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> finished the 297-page novel in February 1987 and, eager for some feedback, dropped off the manuscript with novelist and English professor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiney </PERSON>. Three days later, he was informed a copy of his thesis was on its way to <PERSON> Heiney </PERSON>'s agent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It did n't look like student work. It had the look of professional work,'' <PERSON> Heiney </PERSON> said. A month later, nine publishing houses took part in an auction for the rights. <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> is unimpressed and, in fact, feels downright uncomfortable with all the praise. `` I like what I'm writing when I'm writing it and for about two weeks thereafter. It has a very short half-life in my esteem,'' he said, laughing. `` After that, I'm even assailed by intense doubts. No amount of praise from other people can convince me of the worth of what I've done. `` There's entire stretches of the novel that I ca n't read without wincing. I say, ` Ooooh, why did I say that? It's so clumsy.''' <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> has since sold several short stories to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> and other magazines. He's working on a second novel as well as the screenplay for `` The Mysteries of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>,'' to be directed by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pakula </PERSON> of `` All the President's Men'' and `` Sophie's Choice. Despite his good fortune, <PERSON> Chabon </PERSON> has made few changes in the quiet life he leads in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with his wife, <PERSON> Lollie </PERSON>, 32, an English doctoral student and poet. Their splurges include a new car, a color television and a honeymoon in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` Our strategy has been pretty much the same,'' he said. `` We just basically pretend that it's not really happening.'' Naturally, though, `` It's all real. And I'm just still me.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: `Junk Food Junkie' Stars on Radio Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> says his 1976 novelty hit tune `` Junk Food Junkie'' was a prelude to some of the music he has performed on his radio show, `` Mountain Stage.'' The two-hour program, originating from the Capitol Plaza Theater in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is carried by about 125 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> stations across the country The show, similar to the defunct `` Prairie Home Companion,'' features an eclectic group of performers who sing country, bluegrass, folk, blues, jazz and classical. Others recite poetry or tell their favorite stories. <PERSON> Groce </PERSON>, as host of the show, has performed a routine in which he intertwines the names of country music stars and song titles with the names of classical music greats. He has introduced numbers such as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' `` Bourbon and Water Music,'' <PERSON> Waylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Mommas Do n't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Valkyries'' and <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bach </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' `` Branding Iron Concertos. To sing some of them, he has assumed the identity of <LOCATION> Plastico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flamingo </LOCATION>. Although the show focuses more on music than on humor, the 40-year-old <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> says `` Junk Food Junkie'' was similar to the spoofs he has been doing on the program. `` It gave a preview of that,'' he said in an interview from his rural home near <LOCATION> Philippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I poked fun at organic food and junk food eaters `` I'm fairly knowledgeable about country music and sort of knowledgeable about classical. I like to hit both targets. I've done this in the past. In `` Junk Food Junkie,'' which <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> wrote, he sang about eating natural food such as yogurt by day and enjoying `` a genuine junk food high'' at night. He rattled off a list of his favorite munchies in a tune that caught the public fancy like few others. `` I had always admired satire and humor in songs,'' he recalled. `` I had written others like it _ satires of common, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> things. I felt this was a natural. `` I poked fun at myself, and I had no idea so many others fell in the syndrome I do. The response was more than I thought it would be. It got a lot of exposure in the press because of the odd nature of the song.'' He wrote the tune based on his experiences while working in an organic restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` After work, the cooks would go out and get a hamburger,'' he said. The peculiarity of the song tended to stereotype him, he said. `` I like the song; it's clever and I'm not ashamed of it. But they assume you're an oddball and ca n't sing. Actually my career has been based on singing.'' Since the hit, he has been the opening act on concert tours, performed to smaller audiences in coffeehouses and worked in arts programs. `` I did pretty much what anyone does who's not a big star,'' <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> said. Included in his work are a half-dozen albums for the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, including two volumes of `` Disney's Children's Favorites'' that sold 2 million each. `` They have n't made me famous but they are known quite a bit,'' he said. He's just completed a special for the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV, `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> in Concert.'' He's been doing `` Mountain Stage'' since 1984, first on <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> and then branching out coast-to-coast in July 1986. <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> says `` Mountain Stage'' stresses music more than `` Prairie Home Companion,'' in which host <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> touted his fictional <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town, <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wobegon </LOCATION>. `` We do very different things,'' he said. `` We tend to feature music and showcase the performers. They are the star of the show as much as our regulars. Ours is a little more of a true variety show where the guests take a bigger role. We give them much more time, and our show is not so much anchored in me.'' Guests have included bluegrass acts such as the Doug Dillard Band from the `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show,'' comedy by Dr. <PERSON> Demento </PERSON>, poetry by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON>, blues by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON>, country music by <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>, classical music by the <PERSON> Montani </PERSON> String Quartet and jazz by the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> Trio. `` This show takes chances and it's on the frontier of music in certain ways,'' <PERSON> Groce </PERSON> said. `` We specialize in singers and writers to a great degree. We do n't tell them how to act, how to look or what to sing. They appreciate that. There's no pretense. We just do it. `` Our role is to get people who are trend setters, even though they may not be well-known.'' He still gets the inevitable question: What is your favorite junk food these days? `` I stick with my old favorites like Dr. Pepper and Chee-tos. I also am kind of addicted to peanut butter crackers. Actually, anything with sugar in it,'' he said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Willow''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Much has been written about how crucial `` Willow'' is to the fortunes of its producers: <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, attempting a comeback as a viable film company; and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, still recovering from the bomb of `` Howard the Duck.'' The box-office results are n't in yet, but both <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lucasfilm </ORGANIZATION> can be proud of their achievement. `` Willow'' is movie storytelling in the grand tradition. No, it is n't a landmark film such as <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' `` Star Wars,'' the kind of achievement that happens once a decade; much of `` Willow'' may seem familiar to audiences exposed to special effects movies of recent years or to animated classics from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. But `` Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventure executed with superior imagination. The reluctant hero, <PERSON> Willow </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> -RRB-, is a young farmer who dwells with his wife and two children in a village of little people `` in a place that never existed, a time that never was.'' <PERSON> Willow </PERSON> finds a baby floating in a river, a very special baby who will threaten the throne of the evil Queen <PERSON> Bavmorda </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marsh </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. She orders her warriors to find and kill the baby. The village's High Aldwin -LRB- <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> -RRB- assigns <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> to take the baby to the good castle of <LOCATION> Tir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asleen </LOCATION>, and the perilous trek begins. Willow encounters endless dangers, but he finds allies in the over-the-hill warrior Madmartigan -LRB- <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON> -RRB-, a pair of brownies -LRB- <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Overton </PERSON> -RRB-, a good sorceress -LRB- <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> -RRB- and eventually the bad queen's daughter -LRB- <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Walley </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> provided the story of `` Willow,'' and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolman </PERSON>'s script reflects <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' penchant for highly developed fantasies The richness of detail contributes to credibility, as does <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s straightforward direction As an actor himself, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> manages to protect his performers from being overwhelmed by the special effects. The resulting performances lend strength to `` Willow.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is a natural, his compelling innocence providing the basic core of the film. <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON> has the whimsy and daredevil spirit of <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Walley </PERSON> could be his <LOCATION> Olivia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havilland </LOCATION>, but with even more spunk. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> is equally as fearsome as the queen in `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' and veteran <PERSON> Barty </PERSON> is a commanding presence as the leader of the little people. Only in the latter portions does the film falter. The storming of the castle, complete with self-generating monsters, and the climactic battle between the sorceresses could be trimmed. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wool </PERSON> produced `` Willow,'' with <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> as executive producer. The rating is PG, with much to scare small children. Running time: 125 minutes.

 Looking for a different way to celebrate a birthday or anniversary? Try `` VideoScrapbooks'' _ a line of cassettes featuring the cultural highs and lows of bygone years. Using still photos, TV, film and newsreel footage, Halcyon Days of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has created videos for nostalgia junkies. The 1958 cassette shows <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> in uniform and television ads for that bold sound innovation, hi-fidelity stereo _ `` with you in the middle.'' There are also gasps at space shots, fun with hula hoops, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and that legend in her own time, <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>. The 1938 video has jitterbug marathons, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> on radio and the <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION> joke of all time, `` The War of the Worlds.''

 `` Overboard'' -LRB- CBS-Fox, VHS @ Beta, $ 89.98, Rated PG -RRB- Take one insufferably rich, perpetually bored blonde, throw her into the ocean, add a case of temporary amnesia and stir it up with a hunky handyman bent on revenge, and you've got `` Overboard,'' a charming comedy that looks better on tape than it sounds on paper. Goldie Hawn is <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayton </PERSON>, a `` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' poster girl who changes bathing suits every 15 seconds and gets her jollies by making other people miserable. Enter Dean <PERSON> Proffitt </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Hawn </PERSON>'s real-life honey, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a widowed carpenter who comes aboard the <PERSON> Stayton </PERSON> yacht to remodel a closet. <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> stiffs him and tosses his tools overboard. Later that night, she falls overboard herself and emerges from the drink with no idea of who she is. Seeing a chance to make her pay for her nastiness, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> convinces her she is his wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON>, mother of his four no-neck monsters and keeper of the disaster area they call home. The shock of real life almost kills her, and the transformation from rich witch to human being is fun to watch, though predictable. Hawn, always at home with funny stuff, makes Joanna-Annie alternately despicable and lovable, and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> actually shows some comedic flair in the hands of director <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> `` Happy Days'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Clean enough for the kids, intelligent enough for the adults, `` Overboard'' is one of those warm, fuzzy little comedies guaranteed to make the whole family feel good. _ By <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryckman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> National Writer.

 `` The Couch Trip'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>, VHS @ Beta, $ 89.98, Rated R -RRB- `` The Couch Trip'' sets an enormous challenge for itself by trying to be fresh and funny while using one of the most hackneyed plot lines in the book: Psychiatrists are crazier than their clients; mental patients are more madcap than mad, and often possess, exclusively, truths of a very high ethical order; and said patients appear crazy but it's really the rest of the world that's lost its marbles <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a small-time criminal institutionalized in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mental hospital where his specialty is cheering up the other patients, making it with the receptionist and driving the head shrink nuts. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, big-time radio shrink <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Maitlin </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grodin </PERSON> -RRB- is having a breakdown _ that's what movie shrinks do best _ because he's had an affair, or his wife has had one with his best friend, or something like that. He wants to leave it all behind for a sabbatical but he needs a replacement for his radio program. Through some complicated machinations, <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON> schemes his way out of the hospital, impersonates the head prison psychologist and wins the spot as <PERSON> Maitlin </PERSON>'s radio replacement, providing the film's few hilarious moments Along the way, <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>'s ruse is discovered by, who else? another loonie, played by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthau </PERSON>. They have their little quarrels but mostly seem to enjoy conversing in the higher-truth patois of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> insane. <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>'s most ardent devotees may see something to like in `` The Couch Trip,'' but only if they do n't mind the constant stream of genital humor and four-letter words. _ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitgang </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Serious Slammin''' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ Pointer Sisters Side 1 of the Pointer Sisters' latest album is awful _ dance music as mindless and soulless as anything that surfaced in the disco craze of the 1970s. The sisters redeem themselves a bit on the second side of `` Serious Slammin'.'' Still, it's hard to believe this is the same group that turned out one of the decade's best pop records, `` Breakout,'' just five years ago. One problem with `` Serious Slammin''' is that June, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> have n't changed their formula a bit since `` Breakout,'' and the sisters sound tired of it. They're still singing uptempo dance tunes over synthesizers and drum machines and, for a change of pace, mixing in steamy ballads over synthesizers and drum machines Another reason for the droopy energy level could be the material, all provided by outside writers. The tunes are tuneless, the lyrics lame. The nadir is `` Shut Up and Dance,'' which begins, `` All I want to do with you is dance; I do n't need no verbal expose.'' There must have been something else the Pointer Sisters could have recorded instead. When the songs are decent, so is `` Serious Slammin'.'' `` My Life,'' which opens Side 2, is the first cut that creates any kind of rhythmic momentum. The mid-tempo `` I Will Be There,'' which closes the record, deserves a place alongside such past hits by the group as `` Slowhand'' and `` Fire.'' Alas, most of `` Serious Slammin''' is pointless, sisters.

 `` That Special Part of Me'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Onaje </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Onaje </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> is unknown despite the company he keeps. The veteran producer, composer and pianist has worked with such jazz artists as <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobham </PERSON>, but `` That Special Part of Me'' is his first album in more than a decade. Much of the record is terrific. Jazz is the common thread, although there are also elements of pop and rhythm & amp; blues. <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> writes melodies that give his instrumentals instant appeal, and yet the improvisations _ particularly by <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> on piano _ are intricate and reward listeners who play the record through more than once. There are few frills but plenty of variety in the arrangements. `` Shadowlight'' features a trio and gives <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> a chance to stretch; the <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett-like </PERSON> `` The Dancer'' is <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> playing one grand piano part overdubbed on another. The R & amp; B influence comes into play on the title cut and `` Quiet Passion,'' which find a groove and stay there. The pop element, however, is incorporated with less success. <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> makes <PERSON> Muzak </PERSON> with his cover of `` Did n't I Blow Your Mind -LRB- This Time -RRB-,'' while `` All My Love -LRB- For You -RRB-,'' the only tune featuring vocals, unfortunately sounds like a duet between <PERSON> Dionne </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmond </PERSON>. Aside from the two awry crossover ventures, `` That Special Part of Me'' represents a welcome and successful try by <PERSON> Gumbs </PERSON> for a higher profile.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In October 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> publicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> needed a hard sell to persuade journalists to interview an Australian pitchman-turned-actor named <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>. No problem now. What made the difference was `` ` Crocodile' Dundee,'' a surprise blockbuster that grossed $ 175 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and did comparable business wherever it played. Now <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s back with `` ` Crocodile' <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> II,'' which he swears will be the end of the outback adventurer `` I've completed the circle,'' he said. `` The new one is a good movie; it stands up all by itself. It's the end of ` Crocodile' Dundee `` Yes, I'm sure I'll be asked the same questions in three years and five years. Like, ` What if 10 million people write you and say they want to see more?' That's getting a bit unfair. `` The challenge now is to come up with another character that surpasses ` Crocodile' Dundee. That does n't mean I'll start playing ` The Hunchback of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.' I wo n't stretch credibility too far.'' His remarks will be filed for future reference. Remember when <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON> said no more <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>? Remember `` Never Say Never Again''? If the success of `` ` Crocodile' Dundee'' has changed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, it's not visible. He remains the same wry, laid-back observer of the passing scene. Can he really be just plain <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> any more? `` Yes,'' he said. `` In my home I can. I'm there as often as possible. When I work, I work seven days a week, however long it takes. When I finish the job, I disappear off the planet. Then I become bored with myself very quickly, and I go back.'' About the only places where he can now travel freely, he admitted, are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>: `` Six months from now it may be different. But I do n't really want to go to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> anyway.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> recently talked about the origins of `` ` Crocodile' II.'' `` I decided about the time I finished No. 1,'' he said. `` In the back of my head I thought I'd like to see this go further. I'd like to see this character get in real trouble. The first one was mostly a small-brackets adventure, a comedy and a love story with a little adventure. `` I thought I'd like to do a high adventure _ if I could make it better than the first one.'' In the new film, <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>'s girlfriend -LRB- <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozlowski </PERSON> -RRB- becomes the target of South American drug dealers. After escaping death attempts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pair flee to the Australian outback. The villains pursue them, and <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> faces seemingly insuperable odds. The script was written by <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and his oldest son, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said they made a good combination: `` We were like a team writing songs _ one writing the lyrics and the other the music. He writes very much in story lines, and I write in scenes.'' The <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> story is the kind that makes the film business ever so fascinating. Who could figure that an Australian TV comedian would become an international star with one movie? <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> did n't even start out to be an entertainer. He was making $ 75 a week as a workman on <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Harbour </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in 1972 when a buddy dared him to appear on the Down Under version of `` The Gong Show.'' The object of `` New Faces'' was to humiliate the contestants. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> `` turned the tables and ripped them to pieces. People all over the country loved seeing me get revenge. I was an overnight sensation.'' Soon he became partners with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON> -LRB- who directed `` <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION> II'' -RRB- in `` The <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> Show,'' which drew high ratings and was syndicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 30 other countries. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> became a familiar face here with his commercials for Australian beer and tourism. So many visitors came to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> that facilities were overtaxed. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> is no longer pitching his native land: `` We do n't want tourists sleeping in tents,'' he said. A visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1984 planted the seed for `` ` Crocodile' Dundee. Fishing with friends in the Northern Territory, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> mused about what would happen if his fellow fishermen were transported to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> _ `` they would really think they're on another planet.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> raised the $ 5.6 million to finance the movie. It became <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s biggest grosser, and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> bought the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights and 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> the rest of the world. Before the American opening, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while weightlifting. He quickly recovered and has had no recurrence. `` It was just one of those things that come along to remind you that you're not <PERSON> Superman </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noelene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, who married in 1958, divorced in 1981 and remarried a year later, have five children and have become grandparents. He was asked if he receives more respect at home since `` ` Crocodile' Dundee.'' `` I'm still the head of the house, by sufferance,'' he replied. `` I do n't get any special privilege. I still ca n't turn off the television set and sit in front of everybody and tell them about my day. ` Aw, shut up, <PERSON> Dad </PERSON>,' they say. ` It's boring, get out of the way.'''

<HEAD>National Sharing of `Cadillac Kidneys' Gets Mixed Reviews</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The first time <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> entered a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hospital for a kidney transplant, the donated organ ended up being sent halfway across the country. A week later, it happened again. The kidney, her ticket to a dialysis-free life, was shipped a thousand miles away at the last minute. `` I'm sure the person who got it is very deserving, but it's still very disappointing,'' said the 57-year-old <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> woman `` You find yourself feeling guilty about your feelings because I thought, ` Well, I would n't feel quite so badly if it had stayed in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. But to ship it out ...''' She knew she was competing not only with local patients but also with those waiting and praying, just like her, around the country. One of those waiting and praying was <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who got the second kidney thanks to new national guidelines designed to make transplantation more efficient and equitable. `` I'm just happy it happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. `` I was prepared to be on dialysis for a while. I did n't think I'd get one for a long time.'' Because of an unsuccessful kidney transplant March 16, 1986, two years to the day before her latest operation, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s immune system had built up an unusually large number of antibodies Her best hope was a perfectly matched kidney, a rare and therefore prized possession. When such an organ became available in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in mid-March, the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was forced to relinquish it under the new rules. After a computerized search by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was found to be the best candidate. And <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was sent home, once more, to wait. Her wait ended May 20, when she received a new kidney at <LOCATION> Hermann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. That's the way it goes under the 8-month-old program, which requires <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 201 kidney transplant centers and 120 organ procurement agencies to share all `` six-antigen'' kidneys. Antigens, simply, are features of alien organisms or tissue that can provoke an attack by the immune system. If antigens of a transplanted organ match those of the recipient's body, the immune system usually does not attack. The six-antigen organs, only 2.6 percent of all donated kidneys, had been snapped up where they were procured until the new rules were implemented. `` The nurses and doctors say it's a fair system,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` Of course, I can only believe what they tell me.'' The kidney-sharing policy was adopted last summer by the 31-member board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION> and implemented Oct. 1. The Virginia-based computer center operates the <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, to which all transplant centers must belong to receive <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements. The network was recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Organ Transplantation, formed under the 1984 National Transplant Act. <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION> also instituted a standardized scoring system for distributing other increasingly scarce organs, like hearts, livers and lungs. Patients are awarded points based on medical urgency, length of time on the waiting list and proximity to the donor, among other things. `` It's a great improvement over what existed before, which was a mish-mash of politics and old-boy networks,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. More than 13,550 people are awaiting organ transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 12,200 of whom need new kidneys, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Transplantation. Virtually all of the kidney transplant candidates are on dialysis, the exhausting, week-after-week mechanical elimination of impurities from the blood. To increase the number of nationally shared kidneys and help more hard-to-match, sensitized patients like Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, the network in March expanded the guidelines to cover certain kidneys with fewer than six identified or detected antigens. Failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in suspension or expulsion from the network, and loss of Medicare funding. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION>, expects the change to double the number of perfectly matched kidneys <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION> offers. There were 115 organ donors reported to <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION> from Oct. 1, 1987, to April 30 who matched a potential kidney recipient for all six antigens. Not all were transplanted, for various reasons. Whether it's sharing kidneys or assigning points, the transplant surgeon still has the final say, according to Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UNOS </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. `` The physician has the option of using his best medical judgment. Now he has to defend that.'' The guidelines have not `` changed what they -LRB- centers -RRB- have been doing in terms of getting the right organ to the right patient, because they were doing that anyway,'' he said. `` But it has reduced that process to a written policy which they are able to follow and defend and argue about.'' Reaction has been mixed, and <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said, `` One can not have a national organization of this type with everybody being perfectly happy about it. There is no organized group out there that is in opposition. No rebellion is going on. No centers have refused to participate and abide by these guidelines.'' Mandatory kidney sharing has produced the most grumbling. Some experts maintain that the long-term success of kidney transplants depends on careful matching of the donor and recipient. Others argue that does not justify flying kidneys all over the country since the more they are moved and the longer they go unused, the less viable they become. Donated kidneys can be preserved outside the body for up to 48 hours, four times longer than livers and nearly 10 times longer than hearts. `` Obviously, some people are a little upset when they have to send them out. They could have used them locally just as well,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` We keep trying to remind them that when you give, you get back. If everyone is cooperating, and they must, then there will be a fair distribution.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, winces every time he sends a `` Cadillac kidney'' out of town. `` I do this job because I want to see people transplanted. Period. But I'm a Pittsburgher. I'm very proud of the program here. I want to see this program work. I do n't want to see my kidneys go to waste or share them with everybody.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCombe </PERSON>, transplant coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, is ahead of the game. As of early May, she had given up one prized kidney but got back three, one of which went to Ms. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON> had shipped out two perfect kidneys, but got only one back. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, four went out but none came in. `` We provided four people with kidneys and a chance they might not have otherwise had,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>. `` On the other hand, it just so happens that twice the same patient -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- was asked to come in for the potential transplant and twice told, ` I'm sorry, we have to ship these kidneys out.' `` It's a very difficult, very touchy issue. But if you look in the global viewpoint, we're probably doing what is correct.''

<BYLINE>National Organ Transplant Act</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Organ Transplant Act was passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 in response to the growing need for a national transplant system and medical and ethical guidelines. It called for formation of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> and mandated establishment of a national <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> to be administered by a private group with oversight of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. It provided grants to organ procurement groups to help increase their effectiveness and promote organ donation. It also called for establishment of a registry of recipients.

<HEAD>Forecasters Are Getting Better _ But Not Very Quickly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Beach days still turn to deluge with no regard for forecasters' promises, but the tricky art of predicting the weather is actually getting better. How much better? So accurate, according to one official, that people are starting to believe them. `` It's my impression that there is much more reliance on weather forecasts today,'' says <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glahn </PERSON>. `` People will use them, whereas 20 years ago, they probably would n't.'' There are many statistical ways of interpreting forecasters' track records, says <PERSON> Glahn </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in Silver Spring, But in general, studies show that `` a 48-hour forecast now is almost as accurate as a 24-hour forecast was 20 years ago.'' According to the weather service's way of keeping time, a 24-hour forecast is this morning's prediction of what it will do this afternoon. A 48-hour forecast is today's prediction of what will happen tomorrow. Another example of the improvement, says <PERSON> Glahn </PERSON>, is forecasters' growing avoidance of big errors Last winter, there was a 6 percent chance the weather service would be off 10 degrees or more on tomorrow's temperature. Twenty years ago, there was a 13 percent chance. Other ways of looking at forecasters' prowess produce numbers that are n't quite so impressive. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a meteorologist who retired four years ago from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, notes that it isn' ~ enough to be right most of Anybody can do that. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, for example, it rains one day in three, so a daily forecast of `` no rain'' will be right 67 percent of the time. In <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, it rains just seven days a year, making the same forecast right 98 percent of the time. So <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and others who keep track of such things compare the forecast to the average weather, what's known as the climatological norm. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, forecasters give the correct next-day forecast about 82 percent of the time _ halfway between 67 percent, which requires no skill, and 100 percent. So the forecasters are said to have a 50 percent skill level. From 1966 until he retired, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and his students predicted the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> weather every day. Their accuracy was a little better than the weather service. And over time, he found that their skill improved about 5 percent a decade. A similar analysis by <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> found that the weather service is improving 5-10 percent a decade. Forecasters attribute most of the improvement to computers, which let them create three-dimensional pictures of the atmosphere. Using complex formulas, they fast-forward the weather to create an image of the winds, pressures, temperatures and moisture in tomorrow's skies. `` I think the improvement in the future will be a little greater than it has been,'' says <PERSON> Tzvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal-Chen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not willing to bet my house on it, but maybe my car. I have a very old car.'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> foresees no breakthroughs in forecasting precision. But he quickly adds that his prediction probably does n't mean much. `` Big breakthroughs are always unexpected,'' he says. `` That's one of the interesting things about fishing and science.

<HEAD>Experts Predict Increase in Lyme Disease Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Steere </PERSON> is making his spring rounds, spreading the word that tourists wearing shorts and sandals are easy prey for ticks carrying the disease he identified. <PERSON> Steere </PERSON> speaks about Lyme disease not only as the doctor who first classified the infection 13 years ago but also as a parent whose son caught it despite his father's expertise and caution. `` As this disease spreads into areas where it has not been before, it becomes even a more difficult problem to deal with,'' said <PERSON> Steere </PERSON>, director of the Lyme disease clinic at the New England Medical Center. He was working at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when he discovered the disease and named it for Lyme, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, where he identified it in a group of children. Cases have been confirmed in 33 states, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. To detail the rapid spread of the disease, <PERSON> Steere </PERSON> tells of his son, who caught Lyme disease in 1983 despite daily tick checks. They lived then in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, 30 miles from Lyme. `` When I first arrived in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, it was only in the southeast corner of the state,'' he said in a telephone interview from <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, where he was briefing local health officials. `` Just during the time I was there we saw the tick spread into our community and it has n't stopped.'' The disease is transmitted by the bite of a pinhead-sized deer tick, but the real culprit is Borrelia burgdorferi, a spiral-shaped bacteria. Populations of infected ticks have been found along the Northeast coast from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Early signs of Lyme disease include flu-like symptoms and a circular rash that expands from the bite. Patients given antibiotics early generally are cured without lasting effects. If untreated, 60 percent of patients develop arthritis-like symptoms. Other possible complications include hepatitis, respiratory distress and damage to the heart and central nervous system. Fifteen-hundred cases are reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, but <PERSON> Steere </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said many go unreported because victims believe they have other ailments. Some scientists predict an increase in the number of cases this year because of a growing deer population and an accompanying rise in the number of deer ticks. The majority of tick bites occur from mid-May through July, and most victims report having been in or near a woods with a deer population. Although the ticks that carry the ailment live on deer in their adult stages, Lyme disease is transmitted by bites from immature ticks, which feed primarily on mice. The immature ticks bite humans at `` mouse-belly height,'' placing people with exposed feet and legs at highest risk, <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> said. `` That means a good thing to do when in an area of high risk is to wear light-colored trousers and tuck the cuffs into your stockings. You need to check your pants frequently and carefully, because the ticks are very small, about the size of a poppy seed.'' Those bitten are unlikely to contract the disease if the tick is removed with tweezers within 24 hours of the bite. A <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> company <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> is associated with, EcoHealth, is marketing `` Damminix,'' small tubes filled with cotton treated with a chemical that kills the ticks. Mice carry the cotton to their nests, where the immature ticks live. The chemical is available in a clothing spray but does n't have federal approval and is licensed in only a few states, <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> said.

Early signs include a circular rash and flu-like symptoms. Patients given antibiotics early generally are cured without lasting effects. If untreated, 60 percent of patients develop arthritis-like symptoms. Complications can include hepatitis, breathing trouble and damage to the heart and nervous system. The ticks bite humans at `` mouse-belly height,'' putting people with exposed feet and legs at highest risk, said Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. In high-risk areas, people should wear light-colored pants, making the tick easier to see, and tuck the cuffs into socks. Fifteen-hundred <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases are reported each year, but <PERSON> Steere </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> said many go unreported because victims believe they have other ailments. Scientists predict more Lyme disease cases this year because of an increase in the deer population and a corresponding rise in the number of deer ticks.

But in general, studies show that `` a 48-hour forecast now is almost as accurate as a 24-hour forecast was 20 years ago.'' A 24-hour forecast is this morning's prediction of what it will do this afternoon. A 48-hour forecast is today's prediction of tomorrow's weather. Another improvement, says <PERSON> Glahn </PERSON>, is avoiding big errors. Last winter, there was a 6 percent chance the weather service would be off 10 degrees or more on tomorrow's temperature. Twenty years ago, there was a 13 percent chance.

<HEAD>Drug Appears Effective Against Excess Platelets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new drug appears to reduce the number of blood platelets in people who have potentially hazardous high levels of the clot-forming cells. Too many platelets, a relatively rare condition known is thrombocytosis, can lead to unwanted blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. Like too few platelets, too many can also cause excessive bleeding. Thrombocytosis may also result from other diseases, such as leukemia. The drug, anagrelide, returned platelet levels to normal in 20 patients without harming other kinds of blood cells. A report on the research, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, was published in a recent New England Journal of Medicine.

 A trio of astronomers is studying dwarf galaxies darker than the night sky in hopes of explaining why researchers have been able to see less than 10 percent of the universe through telescopes. Astronomers believe the mass is there because of its gravitational influence and the motion of star systems, and explain it with theories that include subatomic particles called neutrinos, and brown dwarfs larger than planets but too small to shine like stars. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Impey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> favors a dim-galaxy theory. Dwarf galaxies are dim because their stars are much farther apart than stars in the Milky Way, <PERSON> Impey </PERSON> says. In the newly charted Virgo galaxies, stars are 50 to 100 times farther apart than in our own, yet they contain a billion stars or more. While their total light output is substantial, the starlight is distributed so diffusely that no part of the galaxy is brighter than the sky. <PERSON> Impey </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Malin </PERSON> of the Anglo-Australian Observatory at Siding Spring, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bothun </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> have found only the brightest faint dwarfs, but even so they've found at least 100 times as many faint-dwarf galaxies as brighter ones in <LOCATION> Virgo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Impey </PERSON> said In the research, <PERSON> Malin </PERSON> searches with the 48-inch, wide-view <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schmidt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION> at Siding Spring, <PERSON> Impey </PERSON> uses the larger optical telescopes of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Steward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> to study the properties of the galaxy, and finally <PERSON> Bothun </PERSON> looks with a radio telescope.

<HEAD>American Stores To Acquire Lucky For $2.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In winning an agreement to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is gaining a supermarket company given high marks for its management and marketing ability. Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, has agreed to be acquired by American, the third-largest, in a buyout valued at about $ 2.5 billion cash, or $ 65 a share. The merger would create the nation's biggest grocery store chain. The agreement announced Friday terminated Lucky's April 28 deal to go private in a leveraged buyout led by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.35 billion in cash and stock. It also gives <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a chance to take advantage of the management expertise and longstanding identity as a low-price leader that analysts say have been among Lucky's most valuable assets. `` <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> has always considered Lucky to be the leading supermarket chain in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is enthusiastic about the combination of our <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- grocery store -RRB- operations with those of Lucky,'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.S. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said in announcing the buyout. Analysts widely had speculated that if <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in acquiring <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, Calif.-based Lucky, it would merge the company with its weaker <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> chain in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Lucky Stores has 480 stores and had $ 6.4 billion in 1987 sales. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> has 1,600 stores and $ 14.1 billion in sales. Lucky also was seen as a desirable takeover target because of a restructuring prompted by an unsuccessful takeover attempt last year by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. The company sold off its non-grocery divisions, plus stores in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under the restructuring, and paid $ 2.8 million of <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s legal costs in return for his dropping the hostile bid. While the $ 65 a share price being paid for Lucky was considered high by some analysts, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> might justify the cost through the efficiencies of combined operations, industry experts said. To break off its buyout agreement with <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the firm a $ 20 million fee plus expenses. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, Lucky closed unchanged at $ 64.37 -LCB- Friday while <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1 to $ 53.25. The offer from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> is subject to a majority of Lucky's 38.6 million shares being tendered. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> said it had written commitments from commercial banks for all financing required. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> offer expires at midnight EDT June 1. Lucky shares not purchased by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive $ 65 in cash in a subsequent merger between Lucky and a subsidiary of American. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> had raised its bid for Lucky to $ 65 a share last Tuesday. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s latest offer was for a leveraged buyout that would pay $ 61 a share in cash for about 92 percent of Lucky's outstanding shares <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> would also have issued preferred shares valued at $ 7 a share for the remaining shares. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' second bid followed the disclosure of confidential information by Lucky to American, under the stipulation that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would either sweeten its offer or end its hostile bid. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> initiated the bidding with a $ 45-a-share tender offer that Lucky rejected as inadeauate in March, as it did a later offer of a negotiated acquisition at $ 50 a share.

 The government says it will extend for three more months a freeze on wages and the prices of federally regulated goods and services as part of its battle against inflation. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> decided to hold wages, prices and the peso-dollar exchange rate steady until the end of August, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` We will not be able to sing victory in the fight against inflation until -LRB- the rate -RRB- gets to comparable levels with the trading partners of our country and ... stays -LRB- at that rate -RRB- for several months,'' the news agency quoted de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> as saying. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> unveiled the program, called the Economic Solidarity Pact, in December in an effort to bring under control the nation's skyrocketing inflation rate. Consumer prices soared a record 159.2 percent in all of last year. When the program was announced, government officials said its goal was to reduce the monthly inflation rate to 2 percent to 3 percent by year's end. But the government reported earlier this month that consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in April, well under the record 15.5 percent posted in January. Budget Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> said last week that May's inflation pace may run about 2 percent. The economic program, as initially drafted, called for the monthly indexing of wages and prices. But administration officials quickly turned the plan into a quasi-shock program featuring the wage and price freezes. Prices on government-controlled goods and services, such as tortillas, subway fares and gasoline, have been frozen since March. The exchange rate for the peso currency also has held steady since then, trading at about 2,260 pesos to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. By extending the wage-price freeze through the summer, the government appears to have guaranteed that inflation will be low for the crucial July 6 presidential elections.

 An auto dealership fired two black salesmen for racial reasons and must reimburse them for back pay and rehire them if they want their jobs back, a federal judge ruled. <LOCATION> Perillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> violated the Civil Rights Act when it fired <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilyard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> in 1986, Judge <PERSON> Prentice </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ordered full back pay for the men, who are black, and ordered <PERSON> Perillo </PERSON> to rehire them if they want their jobs back. <PERSON> Gilyard </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 60, said they were among four blacks on a 10-member sales staff when new management took over the dealership in 1986. Within 60 days no blacks were employed at the company, the two men claimed. In ruling on Friday, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreeger </PERSON>, new-car sales manager at <LOCATION> Perillo </LOCATION>, `` manifested the agonies of the damned'' as he tried to defend the firings when he testified. `` We should have had a videotape of Mr. <PERSON> Kreeger </PERSON>,'' the judge said. `` He trembled, licked his lips ... telling a phony story for <ORGANIZATION> Perillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Kreeger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perillo </PERSON>'s general manager, argued that they fired <PERSON> Gilyard </PERSON> because of absences and insubordination and fired <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> because he was rude to customers and used ethnic slurs. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the allegations of rudeness were `` absolute falsehoods,'' noting that the customer who allegedly overheard the slur `` has amazingly never been found.''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s top envoy to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday urged the Japanese government to open up its market to foreign traders, and said reassuringly that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders were not seeking to destroy the protected beef and citrus fruit markets. Japanese Ambassador <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for briefings, said a breakthrough was inevitable in stalled U.S.-Japan talks over liberalizing Japanese beef and citrus fruit markets. Discussions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s beef and citrus markets `` are under way at present and I think that an agreement will be reached soon,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The ambassador, a key negotiator in negotiations to replace the beef and orange agreement that expired in March, said the time was at hand for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which has benefited from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> free trade system, to open its markets. After talks to settle the beef and orange dispute broke down in April, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on May 4 brought the issue before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a Geneva-based forum for international trade disputes. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has flatly rejected a Japanese concession plan that would counterbalance a market-opening timetable with new surcharges on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef imports, aimed at bringing up prices up to domestic beef levels. <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> discounted criticism in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that an open farm market would destroy the domestic producers. `` I feel that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is not ignoring'' the plight of domestic growers, said <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, who took up his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> post three years ago. Japanese farmers cultivate uneconomical plots averaging only 2.5 acres in size. Combined with high prices for feed and fertilizers, domestically produced fruit and beef are among the highest priced in the world.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Unravel Between Eastman Kodak, Fuqua Industries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to unravel a merger between units of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that created the nation's largest wholesale photofinishing operation. The court, without comment, rejected a competitor's arguments that the deal violates antitrust laws. The competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Phototron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust lawsuit seeking $ 300 million in damages. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, temporarily blocked the merger but the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in March overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while Phototron pursues its suit. The appeals court said <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> failed to demonstrate `` a substantial likelihood of having suffered an antitrust injury.'' Relying on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, the appeals court said, `` To obtain a preliminary injunction, competitors must now supply evidence of predatory behavior demonstrating a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will be injured.'' <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> said the appeals court misinterpreted the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling and made it impossible to block damaging mergers that create monopolies. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has been given `` a stranglehold on competing photofinishers,'' <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1986, in a meat-packing industry case, that a company seeking to block a merger `` must show a threat of antitrust injury and ... a showing of loss or damage due merely to increased competition does not constitute such injury.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> merged to create <ORGANIZATION> Qualex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, combining the <LOCATION> Fuqua </LOCATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Colorcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with Kodak-owned laboratories. The new corporation has 94 processing labs nationwide, with sales estimated at around $ 300 million a year. Phototron, with labs in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West, said it already was being squeezed by <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s so-called `` Colorwatch'' marketing program. Phototron charged that <PERSON> Colorwatch </PERSON> allows <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to control supply and demand by requiring participating retail stores to send film for processing only to wholesale photofinishers that use <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> photographic paper and chemicals exclusively. As a result, <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> said its annual sales have dropped from $ 40 million to $ 22 million because it has lost the accounts of major retailers. <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kodak-Fuqua </LOCATION> merger will help drive competitors out of business by predatory pricing and other monopolistic practices. Businesses engage in predatory pricing by undercutting the prices of competitors in hopes of forcing them to lose money. Then, when the competitors fold, the merged company raises prices. But the 5th Circuit court said <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> failed to demonstrate that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is engaging in such predatory pricing. The case is <PERSON> Phototron </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1634.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened sharply lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to unexpectedly heavy weekend rain in major crop-growing areas.

Rain was falling in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> today and was expected to linger in the central Midwest. Grain and soybean prices had skyrocketed in the last two months as dry conditions dominated the spring weather. `` This is obviously just a continuation of a very emotional market and, I think, a forebearer of things to come,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but about final acreage as well, and the market will have to sort itself out.''

<HEAD>Japanese 5-Year Plan To Confirm Shift Away From Exports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> received a draft five-year economic plan Monday that pinpoints boosting domestic demand as the solution to most of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign and domestic economic problems. The plan will be debated in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s Cabinet in coming weeks and its broad outlines are expected to be confirmed as the directions of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy through 1992. It calls for a wide range of measures to open and deregulate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s markets to foreign competition, improved quality of life for the 122 million Japanese and greater Japanese aid to poor countries. In effect it confirms the shift of the Japanese economy in the last few years away from exports and toward heightened domestic demand. Under heavy pressure from trading partners such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has swung toward domestic consumption as as a way to keep the economy growing and also respond to foreign complaints about the country's huge trade surplus. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a task force reporting to the prime minister, to form a five-year plan last November after he succeeded <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. For six months, 123 prominent Japanese held more than 70 meetings to draft the plan, which has the provisional name Economic Management Within The Global Context. It says <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main problems are how to reduce its trade surplus, which goverment figures showed at $ 76 billion last year, down from $ 89.7 billion in 1986; how to improve the quality of life in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; and how to promote balanced economic and social development within <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The three problems `` can all be resolved by promoting and consolidating the shift to a domestic-demand-led economy,'' it said. The plan does not set a target for reduced trade surpluses, but says they should reach `` internationally harmonious levels during the period of the plan.'' The yen has doubled in value against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the past three years, making Japanese goods more costly and difficult to sell abroad and increasing sales of foreign goods in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The trend should be promoted, the plan said, by measures to make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` a land of business opportunity for the world at large.'' It stressed such areas as tariffs, import restrictions, standards and certification requirements as needing liberalization. The plan said ensuring better housing is the `` biggest issue facing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' on the domestic front. Working people in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area should be able `` to secure quality housing at commutable distances and reasonably priced in terms of income.'' The strength of the yen has propelled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to great national wealth, but the Japanese complain that their small houses and commutes of over an hour on jammed subways lead to a poor quality of life, and that consumer prices are high by international standards. The plan predicts that inflation will be kept to 1.5 percent annually and says the heavily managed pricing structures should be changed to narrow the gap between Japanese and international prices. Taking up one of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s favorite themes, the plan calls for measures `` to escape the over-dependence on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area and to revitalize non-Tokyo economies.'' Metropolitan <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, with 12 million people, is the hub of government and business activity. The plan says some government offices should relocate outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and there should be major investment in rapid-transit systems to encourage dispersal of the population, business and industry into other centers. Overall, the plan predicts 3.75 percent economic growth annually during the five-year period. Of that, domestic demand would provide 4.25 percent growth and foreign demand would drop by 0.5 percent annually, it predicts. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s post-World War II economic surge was largely based on exports, and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gaishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiraiwa </PERSON>, said he expected vigorous debate on the plan's emphasis on domestic demand. Attaining the goals will mean `` pain and burden to the people at large,'' <PERSON> Hiraiwa </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at a briefing. `` Therefore, I believe that the understanding and cooperation of the Japanese people are needed more than ever.'' The plan also calls for tax reforms. The government is moving steadily toward reducing income taxes and introducing taxes on consumption, like sales taxes or European-style, value-added taxes. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has said he will introduce new tax legislation this summer.

 Chinese first came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as cooks and launderers in the gold rush 130 years ago. Today they're flying in from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> with millions of dollars to invest in businesses and real estate. For the large majority, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is a hedge against <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s reversion to Chinese Communist sovereignty in 1997 While <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> entrepreneurs find easy entry under <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s `` investor immigrant'' program, hospitals in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> in British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> report an increase in the number of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> women who come to have babies because the infants automatically become Canadian citizens Other Chinese come as students and professionals. But the entrepreneurs and investors often get a special welcome. `` They have no problem flipping down 5 million dollars -LRB- $ 4 million -RRB- for a house because in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> it would be 20 million -LRB- $ 16 million -RRB-,'' said Premier <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. One recent buyer was <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, whose casino and ferry empire in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> makes him one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest men. He paid 5.5 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 4.4 million -RRB- for a 25-room mansion on Bridle Path, <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s millionaire's row. Across the country in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ka-shing </PERSON>, whose companies represent 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, won the bidding in April for the right to develop the choice 210-acre site of Expo'86. Through his 25-year-old son, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, a Canadian citizen, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> plans to spend $ 1.6 billion to turn the choice downtown strip into `` Pacific Place,'' a high-rise complex that will consist of a 24-hour global financial center, a 400-room hotel, manmade islands with 10,000 housing units and a 630-berth marina. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and his son also control 52 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Husky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 12th largest oil company, and his <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought the ailing <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> this past November. Officials estimate the current flow of Chinese investment at $ 1.6 billion a year, half of it in real estate. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> own one-third of the shopping malls in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, one of three metropolitan Chinatowns. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hou </PERSON>, a Canadian-Chinese community leader, said his real estate company deals with 100 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investors a month. After the first Chinese came for the gold rush and later to work on the construction of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> discouraged further immigration by imposing a tax of $ 50 a head on new arrivals. Those who stayed were denied citizenship until 1947. Today, 600,000 Canadians are of Chinese descent, including more than 200,000 in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and 175,000 in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. At any one time, 18,000 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> students are enrolled at Canadian universities. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has become the leading source of immigrants to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, with 22,100 visas issued last year. `` I came in 1967,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, a 65-year-old <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> real estate magnate who has donated more than $ 5 million to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> universities and the Sun Yat-sen Classical Chinese Garden in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, a replica of the ancient gardens of <LOCATION> Suzhou </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> pulled off the biggest real estate deal in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>'s history in 1972 and has since built a fortune as a conduit for other <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investors `` Now we're seeing more than just flight capital,'' <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There's a second strata of people, young professionals who see the writing on the wall for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and are afraid.'' The Chinese Communists have agreed to allow <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after the reversion of sovereignty, but many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> are hedging against that. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is seen as desirable because of its political stability and large <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> population.'' said <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Eng </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> realtor. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s `` investor immigrant'' program offers a visa in exchange for investment of 150,000 Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 121,500 -RRB- to 500,000 dollars -LRB- $ 405,000 -RRB- in approved businesses. Government figures show <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> investment under the program totaled 776 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 628 million -RRB- last year and created 4,500 jobs. Premier <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> said he welcomes the well-heeled arrivals. `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has been built by foreign capital _ over 50 percent of our manufacturing industry is foreign-owned,'' he said.

 Grain and soybean futures closed sharply lower Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following a weekend of unexpectedly wet weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nikon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> knocked <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from its traditional top spot to become the world's No. 1 seller of equipment for semiconductor manufacturing last year, according to a survey released Monday It was the first time a Japanese company headed the list, according to <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, Calif.-based consulting firm that compiles the annual list. <ORGANIZATION> Nikon </ORGANIZATION> moved up from seventh place on the strength of a 62 percent gain in its sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, while <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in the category fell 20 percent, the consulting firm said. <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, had held the top spot in the world listings since 1980. One reason for its decline was the discontinuation of two lines of business that accounted for 5 percent of its sales of semiconductor equipment, <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> released the full results to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday after <ORGANIZATION> Nikon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement Monday saying it had been listed first. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has given a high priority to preserving the health of American companies that make equipment for producing computer chips, considering them crucial to national security. The industry in general, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese alike, fared somewhat better in 1987 than in 1986, partly because of streamlining and improved market conditions, <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Nikon </ORGANIZATION>'s 62 percent rise in sales was partly the result of an 11 percent rise in the value of the Japanese yen. Also, <ORGANIZATION> VLSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said its estimate of the company's 1986 revenue in the category, $ 149 million, was about 12 percent low. Japanese companies' revenue was converted to dollars at a rate of 150.7 yen to the dollar in 1987 and 168.4 yen to the dollar in 1986. Here are the names of the top 10 companies in 1987, followed by their 1986 rankings and their 1987 revenue from semiconductor manufacturing equipment: _ 1 <ORGANIZATION> Nikon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, up from 7th, $ 242 million. _ 2 <ORGANIZATION> Perkin-Elmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, down from 1st, $ 213 million. _ 3 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, unchanged, $ 208 million. _ 4 <ORGANIZATION> Advantest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, down from 2nd, $ 205 million. _ 5 <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, up from 6th, $ 174 million. _ 6 <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, down from 4th, $ 173 million. _ 7 <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, down from 5th, $ 151 million. _ 8 <ORGANIZATION> Teradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, up from 11th, $ 130 million. _ 9 <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, up from 10th, $ 125 million. _ 10 <ORGANIZATION> LTX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, previous year ranking unavailable, $ 121 million.

 Stock prices lost ground in slow trading today, bogged down by worries about inflation and interest rates. Interest rates, which have been climbing for several weeks, were mostly steady in the credit markets today. But analysts said fears remained widespread that rates were headed higher still. The economy has shown accumulating strength of late, accompanied by some stirrings of inflation. That has fueled expectations on Wall Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will sooner or later feel compelled to tighten credit.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has decided against offering legislation this year to remove antitrust restrictions on the Bell telephone companies, officials said Monday. Although the administration remains convinced the prohibitions against <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies entering certain competitive phone businesses should be removed, the timing of such a proposal will not allow it this year, the officials said. `` It's late into the final year of this Congress and they have a full plate,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurlock </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sent a two-paragraph memo to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet-level </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> saying that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decided to stop efforts to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to support legislation that would either relax or remove the restrictions, according to <ORGANIZATION> CommunicationsWeek </ORGANIZATION>, a trade publication, which quoted unidentified sources in this week's issue. The memo also said the administration had not changed its opinion that the restrictions should be lifted, the publication reported. White House spokesman <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> declined to comment on the memo, but said, `` There has been a policy decision that we are not going to introduce legislation on that topic this year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been behind the push within the administration to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies to offer electronic information services and manufacture telecommunications equipment. Restrictions prohibiting the companies from entering those businesses and from offering long-distance service were imposed by the antitrust decree that broke up <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in January 1984. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who supervises the consent decree that broke up <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, last year ruled the Bell companies could transmit information services, but he refused to allow them to generate the information itself. He said the companies continue to control access to local phone networks, which would give them an unfair advantage over competitors.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Slip In Dull Trading</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices edged lower in light trading Monday, as the market worried about speculation of growing supplies amid weaker-than-expected demand. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed at $ 17.35 per 42-gallon barrel, down 35 cents from Friday. Among refined products for June delivery, wholesale unleaded gasoline settled at 51.44 cents per gallon, down 0.92 cent, while wholesale heating oil closed at 46.91 cents per gallon, down 0.80 cent. `` This was a dull day,'' said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> securities firm. Prices fell because `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production is still up there, while there's some speculation that demand is not as good as a lot of people thought,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> cited a Wall Street Journal article Monday that quoted a European consulting firm as putting the 13-nation cartel's production at 200,000 barrels a day above projected demand for its crude in the second half of this year Traders have been nervously awaiting the upcoming ministerial meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, due to begin on June 8. The cartel officials are expected to try again to find a way to limit their output to support prices. Meanwhile various reports have suggested that inventories have been growing as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production has increased, analysts said.

 The stock market declined broadly in listless trading Monday, bogged down by worries about inflation and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.11 points to 1,941.48, its lowest close since it stood at 1,914.46 on Feb. 9. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> issues, with 424 up, 1,078 down and 470 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 102.64 million shares, down from 120.60 million Friday and the smallest total since 86.36 million were traded in a post-Thanksgiving session last Nov. 27. Consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks at regional exchanges and in the over-the counter market, totaled 121.18 million shares. Interest rates, which have been climbing for several weeks, were mostly steady in the credit markets Monday. But analysts said fears remained widespread that rates were headed higher still. The economy has shown accumulating strength of late, accompanied by some stirrings of inflation. That has fueled expectations on Wall Street that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will sooner or later feel compelled to tighten credit. More signs of vigorous business activity are expected this week. On Tuesday the government is scheduled to report on orders for durable goods in April. And on Thursday, when a revised report is issued for the growth of the gross national product in the first quarter of the year, many analysts expect the figure to show a substantial increase from the 2.3 percent annual rate estimated earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> led the active list and fell 1 -LCB- to 46 -LRB- on reports that the company and financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> were close to agreeing on a plan under which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> would drop a threatened proxy fight for several seats on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board.

A group made up of two partnerships said it was willing to consider sweetening its bid to acquire the company. Coated Sales tumbled 2 -RCB- to 4 in the over-the-counter market. The company said it was investigating two transactions questioned by <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Main </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which resigned as its independent auditing firm. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 19.21 billion, or 0.76 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 1.09 to 142.21. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 2.68 to 290.74, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.19 at 250.83.

 <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's fifth-largest aluminum producer, said Monday it had agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal estimated at $ 725 million Under the terms of the deal, which would make <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> a subsidiary of the Los Angeles-based real estate developer and lumber giant, shareholders would receive $ 19.375 in cash for each share of common stock. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors approved the deal at a special meeting Sunday, the company said. The company's stock closed at $ 17.87 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, down 25 cents from Friday's closing. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>, the holding company for <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has lost money in recent years, but should make a profit in 1988, one analyst said. `` Right now, things in the -LRB- aluminum -RRB- industry are very positive. You've got good pricing and got the industry running at 100 percent capacity,'' said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The export market has perked up for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, given the currency swings, and then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of domestic market has increased as imports have gone down,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION>'s cash bid, which <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> was fair, was recommended to the board by a special committee appointed earlier this month to consider proposals to acquire the Oakland-based company, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> received one other bid that proposed a leveraged buyout from a private investment group, said <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON>, who declined to identify the other party or discuss their bid. Stockholders will vote on the proposed merger at a special meeting to be called soon, the company said. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> bought 32 percent of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s stock from its chairman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, for about $ 200 million Last month, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> sued <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> over a dispute over rights to nominate directors. But the two companies have agreed to ask that the litigation be put on hold, <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which develops real estate, also owns <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest producer of redwood lumber. It has received widespread criticism for speeding up the cutting of old-growth redwoods in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>, which operates plants in nine states and seven foreign countries, reported losses in five of the past six years, primarily because the recession of the early 1980s depressed aluminum prices, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said. But the industry began to recover in 1986 when prices, which had dropped to 48 cents per pound, rose to $ 1.06 per pound, he said. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 362 million or $ 8.11 per share last year, compared with a loss of $ 39.8 million in 1986. Revenues were about $ 2 billion both years. Much of that loss stemmed from the company's restructuring last year, <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON> said. But in the first quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 36.3 million, or 73 cents per share, on revenues of $ 528.3 million. For the same period of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of $ 31.1 million, or 69 cents per share, on revenues of $ 494.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION>, however, runs the risk that it could be buying <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> at a time of peak earnings and the company could be less profitable because of an economic slowdown predicted next year, St. <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said `` I's possible <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings will turn down, but I do n't expect an actual loss,'' he said

 The price of gold continued to rise Monday as the dollar drooped slightly against several major currencies in thin trading. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 460.30 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 456.25 an ounce late Friday. Gold has risen more than $ 15 an ounce since early May, partly because the strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has raised fears that the economy will become overheated and inflation will rise. Gold was given an additional boost Monday by a big jump in the price of platinum, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Deak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Ltd. Platinum jumped $ 17.30 a troy ounce to $ 581.90 an ounce Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. That was in reaction to renewed rumors that right-wing elements in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would succeed in cutting off sales of strategic metals to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> said. Gold has been led upward by buyers from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where unprecedently strong local currencies make gold look like a bargain, said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Moreover, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said, `` The stock markets have looked so dull and uninteresting, money is clearly coming into metals.'' In the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, gold hit its most recent low, $ 444 a troy ounce, on May 9. Its lowest point of the year was $ 425 an ounce on Feb. 29. Foreign currency trading was thin in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because many European markets were closed for a religious holiday. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> did about 40 percent of its normal amount of business, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohorst </PERSON>, the bank's managing director for foreign exchange. `` It's incredibly quiet,'' <PERSON> Hohorst </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.8675 from late Friday's $ 1.8615 Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.8687 from $ 1.8640 late Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar edged down 0.02 yen to close at 124.80 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 124.75 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 124.52 yen from 124.81 yen late Friday. Other dollar rates in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, compared with rates late Friday, included: 1.7018 West German marks, down from 1.7026; 1.4166 Swiss francs, down from 1.4181; 1.2425 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2428; 5.7560 French francs, up from 5.7520; and 1,263.50 Italian lire, up from 1,262.90. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday: 1.7030 West German marks, unchanged; 1.4198 Swiss francs, up from 1.4195; 5.7570 French francs, up from 5.7560; 1.9075 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9070; 1,263.75 Italian lire, up from 1,263.50, and 1.2427 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2420. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold bullion rose $ 3.22 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 460.91 an ounce. The price of gold rose in quiet <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading to a bid price of $ 459.60 a troy ounce from late Friday's $ 455.20.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Plummet Following Wet Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices plunged Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following a weekend of unexpectedly wet weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. On other markets, rain-related selling sent cotton futures sharply lower; precious metals posted strong gains; energy futures retreated; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures were lower. Soybean futures took the hardest hit among the grains, with most contracts off more than 20 cents a bushel at the closing bell. Prices had skyrocketed in the previous two weeks due to extremely dry weather during the planting season. Some spots in the western Corn Belt received more than three inches of rain of rain over the weekend. `` This is obviously just a continuation of a very emotional market and, I think, a forebearer of things to come,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think there is uncertainty not only about the weather but about final acreage as well, and the market will have to sort itself out.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said many traders decided to take profits ahead of the afternoon release of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s six-to-10-day forecast. But the market's sentiment remained `` extremely positive,'' he said. The closely watched six-to-10-day outlook called for most of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to receive below-normal rainfall during the first half of next week. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported soybean planting was 62 percent complete as of Sunday. Corn planting was 95 percent finished and cotton planting was 71 percent done. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 7 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.42 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 5 cents to 7 \ cents lower with July at $ 2.15 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3 \ cents lower with July at $ 1.70 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 19 cents to 21 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 7.57 -LCB- a Weekend rains also dampened the enthusiasm for cotton futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the December contract fell 2 cents a pound, the limit allowed for daily trading. Like soybean prices, cotton prices have soared in recent weeks as dry weather dominated the planting season. But `` the upward move was largely exaggerated,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Cotton settled .83 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 65.55 cents a pound Surging platinum led the precious metals market, which showed surprising strength in the face of tumbling grain and oil prices. Platinum was buoyed by overseas buying, particularly from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, analysts said. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a leader of the opposition political party urged a boycott on exports of certain `` strategic materials,'' including platinum, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves tougher economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. That action also supported platinum prices, analysts said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, platinum settled $ 17.30 to $ 17.90 higher with July at $ 585.90 a troy ounce. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold settled $ 4.10 to $ 5.10 higher with June at $ 462.80 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 4.9 cents higher with May at $ 6.738 a troy ounce. Energy futures slipped on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 21 cents to 35 cents lower with July at $ 17.35 a barrel; heating oil was .51 cent to .88 cent lower with June at 46.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .24 cent to .92 cent lower with June at 51.44 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in a quiet session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle prices fell on fears of a drop in wholesale beef prices and ideas that cash cattle prices were nearing a seasonal peak, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Hog futures also were pressured by fears of lower cash prices. Frozen pork bellies finished mixed, with technical factors supporting the near-term contracts, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .10 cent to .72 cent lower with June at 72.65 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower with May at 80.90 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to .37 cent lower with June at 53.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .77 cent higher with May at 54.02 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.10 points lower at 250.60.

 Officials from six <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states signed an agreement Monday to showcase the region's strengths and promote economic development through a program of joint lobbying and marketing. The Council of Great Lakes Governors revealed the 13-point plan, based on recommendations made by a commission appointed by the council a year ago. The governors could not put a price tag on the plan, but said some of the programs would involve existing state programs. Any costs will be shared by the states, or the council will seek outside funding, they said. The plan includes a marketing campaign highlighting the region's business climate and recreational attractions under the theme `` Great Lakes @ Great Future. `` The -LRB- agreement -RRB- represents a blueprint for our future,'' said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. `` Following it, we expect to fashion and sustain economic progress across our region.'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> signed the agreement, along with <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> did not attend Monday's announcement but had endorsed the agreement, the council said. The governors agreed to participate in a joint trade mission next year, and <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as a possible destination. A trade office also is being planned. The agreement also includes: _ An inventory of educational opportunities in the region _ A campaign promoting research capabilities _ The establishment of a <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to provide supplemental financing for small - and medium-sized _ Creation of a Buy Great Lakes computer network of goods and services _ Development of telecommunication projects for agricultural use _ Appointment of a liason to work with state offices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, responding to a question, said the agreement did not specifically include a provision preventing the states from trying to lure businesses from each other, but said he did n't think that was a problem. `` I think very few of us these days invest any time or energy in really going into our neighbor states to try to lure business away,'' he said. `` From time to time there are companies who propose a move within the region, and we're obliged as governors to talk to those companies in the interest of our own citizens.'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said the Great Lakes states' toughest competition is n't coming from among themselves or other areas of the country but from foreign countries According to the council, the six <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> states include the headquarters of about one-third of the Fortune 500 companies. About one-fifth of the nation's manufacturing is within the region, including 70 percent of the steel producaiton, 55 percent of machine tool business and over half of the automobile production. The Great Lakes region also has a $ 12 billion annual tourist industry, the council said.

 Poor management practices accompanied losses that drove the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, into insolvency last week, a farm credit official said Monday. `` As of last Friday the bank's liabilities exceeded its earning assets by aproximately $ 500 million,'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on agricultural credit. `` This means that the board of directors and management of the bank have lost over $ 300 million in the past three years,'' he added. <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> said sour loans, high debt costs and heavy operating costs had plagued the bank. He said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank sought $ 410 million to $ 610 million in assistance this year but was unable to come up with a workable plan to get out from under. `` It seems you have indicated a lot of what you might call poor management practices down there,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>. `` I would say that's a fair assessment,'' said <PERSON> Thor </PERSON>, whose board was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to bail out the ailing Farm Credit System. Lawmakers expressed dismay that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank had been allowed to go downhill until it was beyond rescue. They prodded officials to avoid any recurrence at other land banks. `` We want to avoid another <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.D., said. Meanwhile, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank reopened its doors Monday to provide information to borrowers. A key federal regulator expressed hope for quick action to restore loan service under supervision of a receiver. `` We are trying very hard to work out an agreement to restore service with the cooperation of some of the other system institutions,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, stressed that the receiver, <ORGANIZATION> REW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, was not authorized to make loans to customers of the bank, which serves 90 local lending associations in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Thus it would be necessary to reach an agreement with other Farm Credit System banks to make loans through the receiver-operated, billion-dollar lending cooperative, whose doors were closed Friday afternoon after months of losses averaging $ 4.5 million. Such loans would be on an interim basis while the receiver winds down the activities of the bank, <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> institution is one of 12 Federal Land Banks within the massive Farm Credit System, a $ 50 billion, nationwide network of borrower-owned banks and local lending associations. The system, largely unknown to city folk outside the financial industry, is a longtime bulwark of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture. Doldrums in the farm economy in the early 1980s combined with unfavorable credit agreements plus high overhead within the system brought some of the banks into hard financial straits in recent years. That prompted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a major bailout bill last year. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank received $ 30 million in aid under the bailout bill but the assistance board that makes such decisions turned off the tap last week and instead asked the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the system's federal regulator, to place the institution in receivership. `` Our responsibility will be to wind down the activities of this institution,'' <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said, adding that it should take less than a year. <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> was asked if the administrartion's action meant there soon would be a rash of foreclosures. `` Quite the contrary,'' he said. He said those whose loans are not performing would get the full benefit of `` borrowers rights'' provisions under last year's bailout legislation. The receiver's task also would involve placing the bank's business with other lending institutions, <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> said He said it was expected that some other system lender would move into the three-state area to take over the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> business but that it was too early to say which one. `` We would expect fairly quick action,'' he said. He said it would be legal for the receiver to sell assets to private lending institutions. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` certainly will be reviewing all significant actions in the district.'' <PERSON> Nayor </PERSON> said there is `` evidence of a turnaround for many'' of the Farm Credit System institutions during the last year. `` There are still several land banks facing serious problems, but they're working their way through them,'' he added The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank's porfolio of more than 21,000 loans totaled $ 1.68 billion at year's end, but 40 percent of that amount was tied up in loans classified either as nonaccrual or high-risk. Liabilities, meanwhile, reached $ 1.909 billion on March 31.

<HEAD>Western Union Reports $625 Million Quarter Loss, Mostly Special
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported a $ 625.2 million first-quarter loss, most of which resulted from costs connected with the telecommunication company's reorganization The loss, blamed on the costs of a major restructuring, compared with a loss of $ 18.8 million in the same period a year ago. Special charges of $ 603 million in the first quarter resulted from write-downs connected with the planned unloading of the company's microwave and voice-switching facilities, officials said. The write-downs reflect the company's exit from the business of providing communications facilities to focus on specialized business and consumer services. The charges also resulted from severance and pension costs stemming from its previously announced plan to lay off 1,800 employees, or 25 percent of the work force, by the end of the year, and from costs related to the curtailing of a management pension plan. Revenues were $ 235 million, compared to $ 205 million for the previous first quarter. Figures in 1987 do not include revenues from <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s international telex unit. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was acquired in December 1987 as part of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s down-to-the-wire restructuring Savings from the layoffs were not reflected in the 1988 figures. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amman </PERSON> said the facilities sales would `` help reduce the burden of fixed costs associated with the operation of a nationwide telecommunications plant.'' The company's stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dropped to $ 3, down 12.5 cents, on the news. One analyst said he looked on the write-downs as expected and not unwelcome, and usually a good sign in the telecommunications business. `` It's better to take them right off, get the bad egg out and move ahead'' rather than let old wounds fester, said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants were up to almost full operation Monday after a tentative contract agreement ended a weeklong strike by 4,700 members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, said the results of the bargaining showed the effectiveness of using the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> contract as a pattern for the Firestone contract. `` While some companies and some analysts have said our system -LRB- of pattern bargaining -RRB- has outlived its usefulness, we feel that it is the most fair and reasonable way to accomplish our goals,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said in a written statement. The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, was awaiting the results of a vote by a local in <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on a settlement reached last week with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Union officials, though, announced Sunday that enough locals had voted in favor of the contract to ensure its approval Nine of 11 <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> locals, representing 10,575 <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> members, approved the contract. Firestone employees returned to work at plants in six states late Sunday, the same day company and union negotiators approved a tentative contract. Firestone spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Strandberg </PERSON> said production was approaching normal levels on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the Firestone pact followed a pattern set by the settlement reached with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> shortly before a strike deadline May 17. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the union's contract with <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> was effectively ratified when the 1,700-member Local 2 in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> `` overwhelmingly approved'' the contract Sunday. No figures were released. Ratification votes on the Firestone proposal are expected to be held this week at company offices and plants in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Russellville </LOCATION>, Ark.; and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The Firestone and <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> contracts both offer workers an immediate 25-cent wage increase that is to be deducted from future cost-of-living increases in increments of 10 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. The 6,500 <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> members who work for <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratified a three-year agreement by May 16 that guarantees against plant closings but includes a limitation on cost-of-living raises during the first year, the union said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> URW </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated its concern for keeping <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> viable, and we trust this will pay off in future improvements for these members,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday let stand a ruling that put millions of so-called fixed annuities under the jurisdiction of federal securities laws. Under the lower court ruling, fixed annuities paying fluctuating interest rates could be regulated the same as stocks and bonds. Insurance industry officials had opposed the rule, claiming it imposed a heavy regulatory burden that would raise company costs and translate into higher prices for consumers. In other business-related actions Monday, the high court: _ Agreed to study the power of states to regulate natural gas production, including `` use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production _ Refused to unravel a merger between units of <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that created the nation's largest wholesale photofinishing operation _ Gave states some power to enforce safety codes at federal nuclear production facilities for hazards unrelated to radiation The insurance industry had been watching the annuities case closely, since it involved policies held by millions of customers and representing billions of dollars. Among these, fixed annuities traditionally have been regarded as insurance contracts because investors never risk their principal. Annuity holders are assured of receiving the money contributed plus a certain amount of interest in payments made at regular intervals. Holders of fixed annuities are assured of a minimum rate of return on contributions. And most annuity plans provide for `` excess interest'' paid at the discretion of the annuity company. In 1967, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that so-called variable annuities, those that do not assure any minimum interest payments on contributions, may be treated as securities regulated by federal law. But a ruling by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last April 15 marked the first time a fixed annuity was also treated as a security. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> sued the <ORGANIZATION> Variable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annuity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in 1982, contending that the fixed annuity is a `` security,'' and that <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION> had violated anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law. A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that the fixed annuity is not a security. But the 7th Circuit court reversed that ruling, reinstating the suit. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION>'s fixed annuity did not qualify for such treatment because its excess-interest rate on existing deposits could be changed at any time at <ORGANIZATION> VALIC </ORGANIZATION>'s discretion. By refusing to hear the case, the high court let that ruling stand. `` We were hoping the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> would take the case,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adney </PERSON>, an attorney representing the Washington-based industry group, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday. He noted that under the appeals court ruling, fixed annuities contracts must be filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, `` and be subject to their regulation _ not just regulation by state insurance departments.'' `` That means considerable expense and complications for the insurance companies _ and for the situation of the policy holders,'' he added. While big companies can afford those added expenses, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> NALC </ORGANIZATION> feared that the increased costs could mean that `` smaller companies might not be able to shoulder the increased risk, or to compete in the market.'' In the natural gas case, the high court said it would review a ruling upholding the power of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials to control production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas reservoir in the world. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 upheld rules adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> covering gas from the <LOCATION> Hugoton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, most of which is carried outside the state through pipelines. Since 1944, the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> permitted owners of underproducing wells to `` save up'' their authorized production ceilings _ creating what are called `` underages'' _ and overproduce in future months to make up for shortfalls. To create a production incentive, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> commission changed the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within specified periods of years or they would be canceled. The rule was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major buyers of the <ORGANIZATION> Hugoton </ORGANIZATION> gas for transport outside the state. It asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to strike down the 1983 regulations on grounds that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has exclusive authority over natural gas production. In the <LOCATION> Kodak-Fuqua </LOCATION> case, the court rejected a competitor's arguments that the deal violates antitrust laws The competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Phototron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sought to block the merger pending the outcome of its antitrust lawsuit seeking $ 300 million in damages. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, temporarily blocked the merger but the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in March overturned the injunction and allowed the merger to occur while Phototron pursues its suit. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Fuqua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> merged to create <ORGANIZATION> Qualex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, combining the <LOCATION> Fuqua </LOCATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Colorcraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with Kodak-owned laboratories. In a ruling on injuries, the court, said a worker injured falling from a scaffold at a federally supervised nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, is entitled to seek a `` bonus'' compensation award under a state law. The court ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

The Ohio Control Share Act is an anti-takeover law, and the <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> statement said it would seek a ruling from federal courts in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that the act is inapplicable. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> dissolved a temporary injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 48-a-share offer by discounting <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations that a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm which once represented the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> company passed confidential information to <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>. The firm, <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cromwell </PERSON>, had advised <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on how to defend itself against takeovers before it represented <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> in its tender offer. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Backman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the Stockholm-based appliance maker, had testified last week that <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> received no confidential information directly or indirectly from <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Cromwell </LOCATION>. He said his company based its action on <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s annual stockholders' report as well as other public documents. `` All the information appeared in an -LRB- magazine -RRB- article that was readily available to any professional investigator,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> agreed, in his ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> also said Monday it has no plans to move <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> operations from the present plant at <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>.
