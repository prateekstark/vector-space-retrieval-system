 The air-conditioned walkway was the extravagance most appreciated by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> political leaders and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> media elite lingering by the mock newsstand bars at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspapers' welcoming party Sunday night. `` Even the <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>' tent is n't air conditioned,'' one guest marveled at the <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> party on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. Dozens of invitation-only affairs and 56 parties for individual state delegations kept thousands of delegates and journalists entertained on the hot and humid day. Prospective Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his family attended <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s crowded party at <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, next door to the convention site, before joining a family reunion hosted by his cousin, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> restaurateur <PERSON> Pano </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatassos </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, dining at a separate party at <PERSON> Karatassos </PERSON>' 103 West, stopped by to greet the families of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his vice presidential choice, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s fans jammed the ornate Fox Theater for a fund-raising jazz and gospel concert, listening to music by <PERSON> Nat </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> resident, and others for three hours before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his family arrived to rally the faithful. Frigid air pumped into a tent spanning the short walkway between the <ORGANIZATION> Woodruff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the High Museum of Art cooled the 3,000 politicians and media honchos attending `` A Special Edition Of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitality </ORGANIZATION>,'' hosted by the parent company for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution. The media chain, founded by 1920 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, apparently spared little expense for its party, filling the tent and the lobbies of both buildings with bars and tables overflowing with home-grown delicacies such as peach cheesecake. Sunday's partying completed a weekend of carousing by about 35,000 journalists, lobbyists, staffers, elected officials and political junkies who have descended on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the convention, which opens Monday. All night Saturday, hotels were hopping, bars were packed and lines extended out of dozens of nightclubs and restaurants along <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> long past the normal closing time of 2 a.m. The horse-drawn carriages in the downtown hotel district were doing a booming business as hundreds of people wandered streets normally occupied in the early morning hours by the now-scarce homeless. An overflow crowd from a heavy metal nightclub spilled onto nearby railroad tracks, halting a train loaded with revelers. But neither party missed a beat as the train retreated. Private parties ranged from a formal dinner-dance at the home of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to an old fashioned `` stump speakin''' with a real stump, mint juleps and ham biscuits, given by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, former wife of former Sen. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, former press secretary to <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The biggest affair was a rock' n' roll extravaganza for about 10,000 journalists at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, featuring plenty of free liquor and dozens of dishes, ranging from hot dogs and egg rolls to <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> stew and jambalaya. Bandstands scattered throughout the huge exhibition hall showcased such acts as jazz artist <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, rhythm-and-blues duo <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and folk rocker <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stills </PERSON>. In a brief greeting, Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> extended a special welcome to the kid reporters for the Children's Express, whom he called `` the only uncorrupted, honest, unbiased'' journalists in the hall. Clearly he had missed seeing the Express reporter who raided a fruit display, plopping whole pineapples into a plastic bag. `` We might get hungry later,'' the boy said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s black community hosted a party for more than 250 black elected officials from across the country at the white-columned mansion of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldston </PERSON>. Many of those revelers then joined former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on his `` Midnight Train To <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>,'' a fund-raiser on the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> to benefit <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1989 campaign for another stint as mayor. Baseball stars <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stargell </PERSON> were among the `` celebrity conductors'' at a pre-ride party at the historic <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, one of the city's few surviving pre-Civil War buildings, before the train chugged out of the depot for an 18-mile loop around the city. During the trip, the crowd from <ORGANIZATION> Metroplex </ORGANIZATION>, a heavy metal nightclub near, spilled onto the tracks. Rather than break up a good party, the train turned around. Few at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s party noticed the difference. The `` in event'' Saturday probably was former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s party for what he called `` my old friends _ and I use the word carefully _ in the White House press corps.''

<HEAD>Record Heat Bakes Both Coasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Record-breaking heat scorched both coasts Sunday, wilting several major league pitchers and sending residents in the normally cool <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area streaming to the beaches. The mercury soared to a record 103 degrees in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It was the city's highest temperature since record keeping began 125 years ago, exceeding the previous mark of 102 degrees set on Oct. 5, 1987. On the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hit a record high for the date of 102 degrees, which was also a record fifth day in a row of triple-digit highs. Downtown Baltimore set a record high for the date of 103 degrees. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the heat heightened the danger of fire and and led officials to close <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and parts of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tamalpais </LOCATION>, northwest of the city, officials said. By noon, the parking lot at <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> was jammed, and motorists inched along several miles of roads leading to the area. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecasters said tempertures wo n't fall to normal levels in the 80s until Thursday. Forecaster <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> blamed the heat on a high-pressure area over the southwestern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which he said is keeping cooler <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> air out of the area. Temperatures also soared above 100 in the inland valleys of southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, sending many to the beaches despite chilly and overcast coastal conditions. About 100,000 people hit the sands at <LOCATION> Zuma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where the temperature was about 70 degrees on the beach and in the water, said lifeguard <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Renaud </PERSON>. Crowds also were heavy at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and Topanga beaches despite morning temperatures of around 69 degrees and fog that reduced visibility to a mere 100 years, said lifeguard Lt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Heineman </PERSON>. `` It was so hot in the valley areas, they just came to the beach anyway,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, two major league baseball teams were able to score nine runs despite the searing heat, and the visiting pitcher refused to take off his long-sleeved undershirt during the game, saying he was superstitious. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION> became the first <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> pitcher to win 15 games this season by surviving the minimum five innings and leading his team to a 7-2 victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was the hottest situation I've ever pitched in,'' <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> said. Starting pitchers in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> also tired early in the heat. Other record highs were 97 at <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; 100 at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; 100 at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; 98 in downtown <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>; 97 at <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; and 107 at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and 104 at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Lemonade Lassies'' in shorts will be dispensing cool drinks on street corners in <LOCATION> Bluefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, again Monday after the Appalachian town sweltered through a weekend with highs of over 90 <LOCATION> Bluefield </LOCATION> bills itself as `` Nature's Air-Conditioned City'' and hands out free drinks whenever the mercury tops 90. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has gone whole summers in past years without doling out a drop of lemonade, but this summer the heat is sending the civic group to the poorhouse, chamber member <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` We've had to do it about five or six times, which is the most we've had in 10 or 15 years,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` It costs about $ 100 a time to serve it.'' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials blamed high heat as the likely cause of last week's death of a 2-year-old girl whose body was found in a sweltering attic. <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy coroner Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchannan </PERSON> said the body of <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasubienski </PERSON> was discovered by her parents Friday. Initial tests showed the child was `` severely dehydrated,'' and the death appeared to be heat-related, he said. In <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, authorities confiscated dozens of rabbits, pigeons, chickens and geese after finding about 20 animals that had died after having been purchased at an auction and stuffed inside cardboard boxes for a sweltering truck ride, police said. Authorities were investigating possible animal cruelty charges against three unidentified people, police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olquin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declaring that `` for the last 17 months I've had <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on my mind,'' arrived with his running mate on Sunday after dismissing last-minute convention controversies simply as `` the stuff of politics.'' His first public appearance in the convention city was at a party across the street from the hall where he will become his party's presidential nominee. `` We're going to come out of this convention a unified party, an inspired party,'' he said. `` We're going to need your help, we're going to need <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' he added in a pointed reference to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who, so far, has withheld an endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his designated running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> canceled appearances scheduled for Monday morning and the expectation was he would be meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in an effort to resolve their differences. `` We have come a long, long way together,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` And now we're in the final stretch.'' When he arrived at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> airport, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor predicted `` a good convention and a strong and unified party.'' `` We're delighted to be here,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and their families flew in on a charter flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, on <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. `` We hope and expect to launch a winning campaign,'' said the man who will lead the Democrats against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was predicting as much, saying that the Democrats had more unity now than any time in the past 20 years and adding, `` The tide is really moving with us.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plane stopped in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just long enough for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator and his wife B.A. to board the plane. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has chosen <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate and he introduced the silver-haired politician as the `` next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' before quickly correcting himself to say `` vice president.'' On the eve of the opening of the Democratic National Convention, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> expressed confidence that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will be a member of his team but emphasized that it will have only one quarterback _ the presidential nominee. `` You ca n't have two quarterbacks,'' he told a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He rejected the idea that he was angered or frustrated by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reaction to the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had openly sought the vice presidential nomination. `` This is the stuff of politics,'' he said. `` I'm on my way to a convention where, if everything goes well, I'm going to be the Democratic presidential nominee. That's never happened to me before. `` I'm looking forward to the week.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked by telephone Sunday morning, but he refused to discuss the conversation or speculate on when they would sit down together in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We know each other, we like each other, we respect each other,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of his relationship with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` No Democratic convention would be a Democratic convention without a little controversy,'' he said, trying to minimize the prospects for disruption by the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said he still has no idea whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will challenge his choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I would hope it would n't be,'' he replied when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name would be offered to the convention as an alternative to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> so far has refused to rule out such a possibility. `` He's a member of the team,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` and a good Democrat besides. An important member of the team.'' But, he said, `` Every team has to have a quarterback. That's the nominee.'' As for a meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would only say, `` We meet when we decide to meet.'' `` We've had a remarkably good relationship,'' he said. `` This has been as quiet and as happy a Democratic race as any I can remember.'' He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s involvement `` as an active campaigner would be a tremendous asset.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also completed action on state budget matters, including using his line item veto to delete $ 138 million in spending. The action enabled the governor to head for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with his state budget in balance. In the evening, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and their families celebrated their first night in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at a dinner hosted by a cousin of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, local restaurateur <PERSON> Pano </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatassos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karatassos </PERSON> is a second cousin of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMontagne </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the restaurant, 103 West. Their grandmothers were first cousins, she said.

<TEXT>
 Escalating strife in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is sending familiar ripples through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appears headed for yet another fractious confrontation over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the region. Riding a crest of anti-Sandinista sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., introduced legislation last week to provide a new $ 47 million in aid _ $ 20 million of it in weapons _ to the Contra rebels fighting the leftist regime in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> The rebels have been without new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid since February, and have been making do with the $ 17 million for food and clothing that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided in earlier legislation. The humanitarian aid was designed to enhance peace talks which collapsed June 9. The talks have not gotten back on track. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's strategy appears to be to get some version of the Dole aid bill passed in the more favorable climate of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, as an amendment to a Pentagon money bill. That could happen soon after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns July 26 from its break for the Democratic National Convention. The measure then would go to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiating committee, where the Contra aid amendment would be among the items subject to bargaining. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team, such as Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., look more favorably on Contra aid than the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and are seen as likely to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> That would mean <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, who have narrowly rejected Contra military aid in the last several showdowns, would be faced with a vote on an entire <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending package that includes aid to the rebels as a small section of the bill. Democratic strategists concede the aid is far more likely to pass in that form, since it would be easier to get a yes vote from the three dozen or so `` swing'' members _ most of them Democrats _ who traditionally hold the balance of power on the issue. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the leading congressional critic of the administration's Contra policy, was seeking to arrange a resumption of the peace talks. He said while he would not oppose an extension of humanitarian aid to the rebels, `` I do n't think there exists in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a desire to resume the war. But chances for the new military aid could be enhanced even further if conditions inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continue to deteriorate. Last week's moves by the Sandinista government to suppress opposition demonstrations and close independent media outlets brought virtually unanimous condemnation from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the form of harshly worded resolutions. Since the resolutions were passed, the government has sentenced opposition leaders arrested at a rally to six months in jail, and has confiscated a sugar plantation that was the country's largest private business. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> also expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven colleagues last week. The outcome of the newest Contra aid push will depend largely on what the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> do in the weeks ahead, said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the party's chief <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote counter If <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> begins to restore democratic freedoms, `` the shrillness, the sharpness of the bitterness will have calmed down,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said recently. The Sandinista crackdowns have demonstrated a lack of concern about the peace process in the region, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. `` If it looks like they're thumbing their noses at the process, you're going to have people supporting some alternative.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s bill includes $ 20 million in military aid for the rebels, but makes it more palatable to congressional moderates by leaving the aid in escrow. It would flow only if requested by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and only if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes another bill authorizing the weapons money. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration bitterly opposed such a congressional `` trigger'' in the last aid battle, but now believes the mere threat of lethal aid may be enough to drive the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to concessions, according to one senior administration official. The official also pointed out that the prospects for new aid may be further enhanced because the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is a consistent supporter of Contra military aid.

 In the midst of the nation's war on drugs, a plant in this suburban community quietly imports coca leaves and processes them into medicinal cocaine and a non-narcotic flavor extract for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>. Workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Stepan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant, the nation's only legal importer of cocaine, must undergo strict background checks, and agents from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> frequently visit, said plant manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Smilek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> said there have n't been any security problems at the plant just west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said it processes hundreds of tons of cocaine each year. The company imports coca leaf from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and to a lesser extent from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. Part of what <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> extracts from the coca leaf is sold to <ORGANIZATION> Mallinckrodt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> pharmaceutical company. <ORGANIZATION> Mallinckrodt </ORGANIZATION> further purifies the extract into pharmaceutical grade cocaine hydrochloride, used as a local anesthetic by eye, ear and nose specialists, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Roxanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Motchan </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Mallinckrodt </ORGANIZATION> also is subject to stringent DEA requirements, including background checks of employees, she said. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> in its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters, said use of the coca extract in the soft drink is common knowledge, although the company closely guards its secret formula, first developed in 1886. `` We've been openly talking about that for 102 years,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, whose name is derived from the company's use of the coca extract, has said that before the refining process was modernized around the turn of the century, traces of cocaine may have made it into some drinks. Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steuert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he's unsure if most of the town's 9,900 residents know the plant processes cocaine `` It's the kind of publicity I'm sure they try to avoid if they can,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> has no official role at the Democratic convention, but <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will make sure there is a place at the table for the burly <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> politician declared persona non grata four years ago. `` He's one of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s kitchen cabinet,'' said longtime <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>'s public support of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> helped give the Democratic presidential runner-up to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ` tremendous credibility among ` Democratic established officials' and Southerners in particular.'' Lance talks as often as four times a day to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said, and his advice is `` sometimes accepted, sometimes not,'' but `` always candid and frank,'' and `` extremely helpful to the candidate.'' Beyond that, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have a close personal relationship that has been nurtured over the past four years of political hills and valleys for both men. `` It's a brother relationship,'' <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's not so much a political relationship as it is a real friendship. ... We're really close in the sense that we can joke with each other and be very frank with each other.'' The alliance between the unlikely pair _ one a fiery black preacher and civil rights activist, the other the epitome of a white Southern insider _ helped <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> make something of a political comeback from troubles that began when he was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> under President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` He got rehabilitated politically, and there's nothing wrong with that,'' said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> left the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration under a cloud of alleged past banking irregularities, then was acquitted of those charges by a federal jury. But he was dogged by a negative image that resurfaced at the Democratic National Convention in 1984. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, thankful for <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>'s help in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, courted him during the convention to head up the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then in the face of party protest summarily dumped him all within a matter of ill-timed days. Lance ultimately stepped down as chairman of both <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign and of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But today it's a different story. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> is sought out by those looking for an inside track on the candidate who will walk into the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention with some 1,200 delegates in his pocket. In rare appearances on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> invariably was buttonholed by reporters eager for his insight. He gamely sang <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s praises on TV news programs, giving early assurances that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not a disruptive force but a loyal Democrat. And when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign needed a public display of establishment acceptability as his campaign was catching fire, it was largely through <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>'s efforts that a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders was arranged in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Their friendship goes back to 1983 when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began his presidential bid. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> had already proven himself by organizing Southern state chairmen to go to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home base of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and campaign for <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who became the city's first black mayor in a bitter election against <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. It was <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> whom <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> turned to as a liaison to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in trying to deal with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s various complaints about party workings. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who ran <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, recalls an early negotiating meeting with <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It was a chemistry that worked right away. They talk a lot of grits and gravy with each other. They talk South,'' with a natural affinity since <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON> said. `` The two of them sit there and they'll go face to face and disagree with each other. I've never seen two guys fight through smiling the way those two guys do.'' <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> politician <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> said their affinity stems in part from rejection at the hands of their own party. `` Their relationship was born in pain. Here were two men who had walked on the hot coals and felt that they had not been dealt with fairly ... There's no question in my mind that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a hero of <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> is a hero of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Iran Asks Airbus Help In Search For Flight Recorders</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has asked the European Airbus consortium for help in its search for flight recorders from an Iranian jetliner that was shot down by an American warship. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> made the request. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alizart </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> consortium in the French city of <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>, said the company received a telex Wednesday from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> asking where to buy or rent equipment to help find the flight recorders. The A300 was shot down by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> on July 3, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 aboard were killed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities said the plane was mistaken for an attacking F-14 jet fighter. The Pentagon said information gathered by the cruiser showed the plane was descending in altitude on an `` attack profile,'' but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the plane was climbing. Discovery of the plane's two flight recorders in the waters of the Strait of <PERSON> Hormuz </PERSON> could help determine the truth. Each of the black boxes containing the recorders has a radio beacon that can transmit for 12 to 30 days after a crash. <PERSON> Alizart </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> does n't manufacture the beacons, so the company is tracking down an agency of the British-based beacon manufacturing company that could provide <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> with the equipment it needs to detect the black boxes. The Iranian news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said Iranian frogmen have searched for the recorders since the plane was shot down. So far, 179 bodies have been recovered, the agency reported.

<HEAD>Iraq's President Urges Iran To Accept `Honorable' Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Sunday that a string of Iraqi victories on the battlefield should persuade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept an `` honorable'' peace and end the war between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nations. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> later said its forces withdrew from an Iranian border area after ridding it of enemy troops and bombed industrial targets in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s rulers have to accept the peace road, they have to abandon their unjust dreams and foolish mottos and slogans, their hollow illusions after their defeats,'' the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader declared in a speech broadcast on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s speech came on the 20th anniversary of his seizure of power. He proposed that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sign a peace accord, exchange prisoners, return to their respective borders and vow not to interfere in each other's internal affairs. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> first listed his peace plan in an open letter to the Iranian leadership in August 1986. A military communique issued shortly afterward said Iraqi forces withdrew from the Iranian town of <LOCATION> Dehloran </LOCATION>, which they seized Tuesday. The Iraqis advanced 30 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to capture Dehloran after chasing Iranian forces out of the Zubaidat region on their side of the border. Military communiques said at the time that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not wish to hold onto Iranian territory and would withdraw from <LOCATION> Dehloran </LOCATION> after clearing the border area of enemy troops and destroying their bases. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed fuel storage tanks near the southern Iranian city of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION>, scoring `` destructive hits.'' There was no immediate Iranian comment on the Iraqi reports. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s victories in <LOCATION> Zubaidat </LOCATION> and Dehloran were the latest in a series of Iraqi triumphs this year that chased Iranian troops out of almost all the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory they had seized since 1982. The Iraqis began recapturing their lost territories in April. They said they seized about 133 strategic heights in the northern region of the 730-mile long front. Simultaneously, they launched assaults in the south, recapturing the southern <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in April and the <LOCATION> Shalamcheh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Majnoon </PERSON> islands in May and June. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said these victories could lead to a peace settlement and urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepts the July 1987 resolution, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> maintains the conflict can not end until <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is branded the aggressor in the war. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> stands now on victorious ground ... confident today and in the future. Iraqis and the noble Arabs now stand on victorious peaks while the rulers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are in the trench of defeat and shame,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> extends the hand of honorable peace and calls on the Iranian rulers to draw lessons from their defeats,'' he said. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> stressed Sunday that any settlement should guarantee <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s navigation rights along the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which forms the southernmost border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, as well as through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the narrow entrance to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only access to the gulf along the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> has been blocked by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the outbreak of fighting.

<TEXT>
 Every time policeman <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> drives down <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> near the Mexican border he remembers how it felt to be pinned down by a fusillade of bullets from an deranged man's submachine gun. And he wishes he'd been the officer who fired the shot that ended <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Huberty </PERSON>'s 77-minute rampage in a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant four years ago Monday <PERSON> Huberty </PERSON> killed 21 people and injured 19 before being slain. The restaurant was razed after the July 18, 1984, massacre _ the nation's worst one-day mass murder by a single gunman _ and a <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> building is taking shape on the lot. `` Every time I go by, I look at the spot and the area where I laid for about an hour,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>, who was the first officer on the scene. The 10-year <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> veteran said in a recent interview that the first call was for an assault with a deadly weapon. He expected to find a victim of a domestic argument. He parked his car and began walking toward the postal building where the victim had been reported. `` I looked over and I see people hiding behind cars, crouched behind cars,'' he said, `` and I got this funny feeling in my stomach that something was really wrong, deadly wrong.'' `` At that time, an older guy pointed to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and I was standing right dead in the middle of the parking lot.'' He spotted a man with an Uzi 9mm submachine gun in the doorway. `` We made eye contact and he brought it up in an aiming position and I looked for cover,'' <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> said. `` There was this truck right to my right there, a big truck, thank God, because I got right behind it and it saved me. `` He was shooting over me, and trying to get the rounds through the truck. At one point he tried to skip the rounds off the ground.'' Inside the restaurant, <PERSON> Huberty </PERSON>, 41, ordered the four dozen patrons to lie on the floor. Armed with a small arsenal of weapons and more than 400 rounds of ammunition, the unemployed security guard systematically shot his victims, pausing occasionally to sip a soft drink. The massacre ended when police sniper <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> fired one shot through <PERSON> Huberty </PERSON>'s chest. `` I would've loved to be the one,'' said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON>. `` And I did have him in my sights for about 10 seconds. But by the time I did what I had to do he had moved.'' Soon afterward, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had the restaurant razed and donated the three-quarter-acre lot a mile from the Mexican border to the city, with the stipulation that no restaurant be built there. For three years, the land was occupied only by a makeshift shrine to the victims. Some argued a park should be built as a permanent memorial on the site, about 20 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. It finally was sold for about $ 136,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a community college with about 14,000 students. School officials expect a one-story classroom and administration building to be completed in time for the fall semester. The agreement calls for the school to dedicate a 300-square-foot area in front of the building for a permanent memorial to the victims. The college's students were invited to submit designs for the memorial and a committee is selecting one from about 30 entries, said school spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvell </PERSON>. Councilman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Filner </PERSON>, whose district includes the community of about 17,000 people, said selling the land to the college seemed appropriate. `` I think because we did something positive, the anniversary is less of a negative thing now than it would have been,'' he said. `` People now see something positive going to happen there.''

<HEAD>Negative Information Leaked About Two Former Meese Aides</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Controversy follows Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> everywhere he goes _ even out the door. The latest installment involves the leaking of unfavorable information about two former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who have been invited to testify before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel about their former boss. Committee sources and sources close to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> say the leaks were an attempt to discourage the two men from testifying. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation by itself may have convinced one of the men, former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, to resist the committee's invitation to testify about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> reportedly believes <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s stewardship is now `` ancient history.'' But former criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who along with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> suddenly announced his resignation March 29, is still expected to appear July 26 before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> left March 29 when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was under intense scrutiny from independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, who was investigating <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct on a number of ethics matters. The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> invited both men to tell why they left, but neither would consider the request before <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> completed his work. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> submitted his still-secret findings on July 5 and, on the same day, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced that he would resign in late July or early August. The committee then committee asked <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> to testify on July 26. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report was expected to made public on Monday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Short, a committee aide to Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said he was asked by the committee's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> staffers after <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s resignation announcement to check whether <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> were coming. According to <PERSON> Short </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> told him `` the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> story is now ancient history, but if I'm subpoenaed, of course, I would testify.'' A subpoena is highly unlikely, and as of now, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is not expected to come. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> described his conversation with Short in a startling letter to the committee. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Short </PERSON> `` asked me whether there was an internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of me in 1986 or 1987, based on an anonymous letter alleging that I had smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982, and if so, whether that might not ` complicate''' the testimony. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> pointed out an internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation found the allegation `` lacked merit,'' and in subsequent interviews emphatically denied the marijuana incident. <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said he received a call about the marijuana allegation and `` asked <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> about it.'' Asked if he was attempting to hint to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> that he avoid testifying, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said in an interview, `` Absolutely not. Not under any circumstance.'' Furthermore, <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said, he made the calls to <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> at the request of the Democratic committee staff because both men are Republicans and <PERSON> Short </PERSON> knew them personally. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitenstein </PERSON>, chief counsel for the committee's Democratic majority, supported Short. `` I do n't believe <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> tried to discourage <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> from testifying,'' he said. `` I do n't believe that was his intention.'' But last week, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> carried a news story about the marijuana allegation, and had previously published several stories about <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' efforts to get his former law partner a federal judgeship. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, said he had `` no idea who is responsible for making any of that information available.'' As to the conflict-of-interest allegations, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Markman </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general in charge of screening judicial candidates, said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> was above board in his efforts on behalf of his former partner, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Summit </PERSON> _ now a nominee for the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously his name came to our attention because of his relationship to Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Markman </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> probably bent over backwards to make sure he was n't viewed as pushing the candidate to the exclusion of other candidates. `` Mr. Summit went through the normal procedures _ the regular interview process, the regular background process, and final approval by the attorney general. The attorney general was aware that Summit was a partner of <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>' relationship with Summit was quite open.''

 A guerrilla commander said Sunday that communist rebels are willing to open new peace talks with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. But <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Meliton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glor </ORGANIZATION> communist rebel faction on the main <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said the offer must not be considered an act of surrender. <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON> said the military has been sabotaging reconciliation efforts by both the rebels and the government. `` We are ready to hold talks for the pursuit of long-lasting peace, but never for surrender,'' <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON> said. `` The present government is prone to saddling -LRB- us -RRB- with terms unacceptable for free-wheeling talks, with the military ... acting as saboteurs to any peaceful effort.'' The representative of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed armed branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, made the statement in a tape-recorded message sent to news agencies. <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON> did not say on what terms the rebels were willing to negotiate. <PERSON> Rosal </PERSON> also represents the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a 12-member umbrella group that includes the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its army.

<TEXT>
 Orthodox Jews are scouring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> beaches for a rare snail that produces a blue dye they say is needed to revive a religious ritual abandoned 1,500 years ago The snail hunt was prompted last week by Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who is trying to recreate a process once used to dye a single thread of the Jewish prayer shawl in accordance with a biblical command. Jews were forced to abandon the practice in the fifth century, <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON> said, when Roman authorities banned all but the ruling class from wearing colored clothing. The recipe for the dye they used was lost. `` Now we are looking for it,'' said <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON>, of the prestigious Mercaz Harav religious seminary. `` We want to revive the mitzva -LRB- biblical command -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief rabbis, who rule on religious issues, have not given the go-ahead to renew the ancient practice and are awaiting <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON>'s findings before they consider it, said <PERSON> Zalman </PERSON> <PERSON> Quittner </PERSON>, a spokesman for the rabbis. Interest in the mollusk mystery was roused when <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON> appealed in a religious newspaper, `` Erev Shabat,'' for seminary students to seek out the rare snail, known as the Janthina or `` violet snail'' because of its purple-blue color. <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON> said he has been deluged with reports of snail sightings. But he has so far collected only a tenth of the `` bucketful'' he says is needed to extract enough dye to test his theory. The 33-year-old rabbi is trying to validate a claim made in 1920 by the late Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Halevy </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, father of President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>. In a doctoral thesis at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, the elder <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> suggested the original dye used came from the Janthina snail. But he noted the the snail seldom made it to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> shores. This summer, however, the snails have been sighted along with schools of jellyfish that have been plaguing beaches, <PERSON> Burstin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mienis </PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mollusk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION>, said there are five species of the Janthina. The largest are 1 -LCB- inches in diameter, he said. The ancient Jewish practice involved coloring one of eight strands of a prayer shawl as a sign of devotion to God. The white prayer shawls have been worn under clothing by devout Jewish men since the ancient Israelites roamed the desert with <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> during their exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. It is customary to kiss one of the fringes during portions of morning prayers. The Old Testament says that God ordered Moses: `` Speak to the children of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put on the fringe of each corner a blue thread. `` You shall have it as a fringe, so that when you look upon it you will remember to do all the commands of the Lord, and you will not follow the desires of your heart and your eyes which lead you astray.'' The Talmud, which interprets Jewish law, explained how the blue fringe should be dyed but did not give the source of the dye.

<HEAD>Democratic Hispanics Establish Political Group To Boost Unity,

 About 150 Hispanic Democrats founded a political group of their own Sunday in an effort to galvanize the clout of the nation's fastest-growing minority. `` We're here to demonstrate to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that we are a community once and for all united,'' Rep. <PERSON> Esteban </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a co-chairman of the group, told the Sunday morning gathering. `` We're coming together here for the first time and it will not be the last.'' The group, called <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, is made up of Mexican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans and Cuban-Americans. About 200 of the 4,200 delegates to this week's Democratic National Convention are Hispanic. Hispanics have drawn acute attention from both parties this year because their growing vote is concentrated in key states like <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Both Democratic presidential candidate-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his Republican counterpart <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have already pledged to appoint a Hispanic cabinet member if elected. The group said it hopes to capitalize on that interest. `` What we have here is the most serious effort in recent times to focus the Hispanic agenda,'' <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. `` Our challenge is not the differences sometimes created by national origin or regional bias but the similarities which over shadow our differences.'' In the past, organizers said, differences among the different segments of the Hispanic population have kept its clout fragmented. The new group has agreed to disagree on some issues, but agrees on the need for improvements in education, jobs, health care and crime fighting as well as mobilizing the Hispanic vote in November. `` The time is right for this to work,'' said co-chair <PERSON> Marife </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> activist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We're going to make sure that we're heard.''

 On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, with 4,162 delegates watching to see what he's made of, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is still struggling with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for control of a prime-time spotlight that ought to be his without question. Through weeks of pre-convention jockeying, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has never been able to get <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to quit gnawing at his ankle. If it is n't one thing _ the vice presidency, a platform plank, a mediator, partnership _ it's another `` It's supposed to be his convention,'' someone mentioned to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Sunday. `` That's an illusion,'' he responded. `` This is a convention of the people. It's the delegates' convention. They will determine who the nominee will be.'' The nominee will be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> every Tuesday for months on end. Now the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people want the payoff: televised unity that will provide a campaign boost in the fight against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This is the stuff of politics,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Sunday in minimizing the prospects for convention chaos. `` No Democratic convention would be a Democratic convention without a little controversy.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been running for president for five years _ drawing large and adoring crowds that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can only dream of _ and he is hard put to give up the limelight. He seems reluctant to even share it. The week could go two ways. At this late date, the best <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can do -LRB- and it's pretty good -RRB- is a convention that looks like this: Monday: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> makes a neighborhood anti-drug appearance, pressing one of his key issues against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does some quiet missionary work and wins private assurances from key <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters. A summit is arranged, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> emerging with broad grins and little to say. <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> sings the national anthem and millions of TV viewers wonder if this is n't going to be a Democratic year Tuesday: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does a zillion interviews by satellite with local TV anchors. They want to know about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and he tells them Democrats are united on the key economic issues. OK, so there's a floor fight on the platform. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people oppose three <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> planks _ no tax hike and no freeze on military spending and no <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state _ and they relish and win a showdown. The story of the day is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech and what a speech. Hands that pick cotton will pick a president. The crowd is going crazy _ how else to describe it? _ and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is somewhere fidgeting a little, when the hysteria ends with a dramatic encore: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> returns to the podium and endorses the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. Wednesday: It is nomination day and delegates pack the hall after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> attend an emotional ceremony at the Martin Luther King Center. The roll call is a loose, bantering competition between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stalwarts. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> _ two key states with 48 electoral votes between them _ compete to put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over the top. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> makes a surprise appearance, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at his side, and nomination night becomes unity night, too. Thursday: The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> roll call is anti-climatic after all the delicious speculation of a Jackson challenge. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> follows his victory with a speech that lays out the case against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. I beat him once and I ca n't wait to beat him again, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says. He tells that wonderful <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> joke: `` I like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because we're both Texans I'm from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and he's from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> takes to the podium and looks taller than he is. His is a vision of the future, upbeat. He is the son of immigrants, proud of the path he has traveled, insistent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can have change for the better. For the first time in months he does not _ not _ deliver the standard lines about good jobs at good wages, and the need for `` a real war, not a phony war'' on drugs. That's the message, but delivered in new, more dramatic rhetoric. Then `` A Fanfare to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' music by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, orchestra led by <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>'s dad, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION>. That assumes <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will stop biting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ankle. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' worst nightmare _ a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> convention _ looks like this: Sunday: On the eve of the Democratic National Convention, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is acting more like <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> His arrival is overshadowed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appearances in which he tells supporters they `` deserve respect, not just an apology.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> delivers an apology, his 16th. Monday: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' anti-drug appearance is overshadowed by a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> foray into one of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s toughest neighborhoods, where he leads a spontaneous rally which sweeps dealers and degenerates off the street to cheers of `` Down with dope, up with hope.'' Tuesday: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech sends his 1,100 delegates, and most of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>', into a frenzy. He pushes every Democratic button with a revivalist style that simply takes over the convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people stand with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters and wave a common banner: Dukakis-Jackson'88. Wednesday: Nomination day. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> veep fever running high. Thursday: <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is nominated, but so is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ he could n't stop the draft-Jackson movement if he tried But things have gone far enough _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> takes to the podium, endorses <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and calls for acclamation. He has controlled the convention from the beginning to now. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speaks. Viewers wonder _ if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can control <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' convention, will he control his campaign, his presidency?

<HEAD>Sandinistas Mark Ninth Year Facing Unprecedented Public Discontent</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the eve of its ninth anniversary, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government confronts unprecedented discontent brought on by civil war, a shattered economy and unfulfilled promises. The Sandinistas have put the brakes on recent moves to restore basic freedoms and have cracked down on opponents with a vengeance. The measures came just days before July 19 anniversary ceremonies being held in the city of <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of the capital. The government began easing restrictions on civil liberties to comply with a regional peace plan signed in August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. The plan, aimed at ending the war here and guerrilla wars in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, called on signatory nations to grant amnesties, negotiate cease-fires and undertake democratic reforms. To comply, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in January lifted a 6-year-old state of emergency. Discontent started surfacing immediately. Opposition news media that had been shuttered or censored under the emergency law reappeared and harshly attacked the government. Anti-Sandinista marches, which had been prohibited, began. With their more liberal policies, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> achieved their main goal: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted down a request by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to renew military aid to the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government. But last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> lashed out, indicating they had had enough and would n't take any more. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and his cabinet also came under pressure from party hard-liners opposed to the concessions, which included the previously taboo step of opening negotiations with the Contras. In a series of quick moves, the government expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other American diplomats July 11, a day after police beat up opponents at an anti-government demonstration. It jailed three dozen opposition figures, closed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> and a private news program, and ordered <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, the only opposition newspaper, to suspend publication for 15 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said the crackdown was a response to a destabilization plan fostered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and increasing rebel attacks. But they offered little proof to back up their accusations. Barricada, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, published a list Saturday of dates on which <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and the other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats met with opposition groups. The headline read, `` Subversive Itinerary of <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called the visits normal. The Sandinistas have become increasingly frustrated by their inability to end the Contra war, which is wrecking the economy and fueling public discontent. In a move that took <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> off guard, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> and rebel leaders signed a cease-fire agreement March 23, but since then they have made almost no headway in discussions to achieve a permanent truce. The initial cease-fire, extended for 30-day periods by tacit agreement on both sides, has been wearing thinner and thinner in recent weeks, with the government recently reporting almost daily rebel attacks. Opposition leaders said the crackdown was motivated by the government's fear that the usually fragmented opposition was unifying. Some claimed the crackdown showed the true face of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. `` The mask came off and the people did n't see smiling faces. They saw gas masks,'' said <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> labor minister and now president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the opposition protest July 10 which police broke up with tear gas. When the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in a 1979 revolution that ousted the rightist, pro-American dictatorship of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, they promised a better life to a poverty-stricken people. They enjoyed widespread support. `` We knew they were Marxists, but we thought they were different Marxists who would deal realistically with the situation here,'' <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> said. `` Many people felt deceived.'' In 1981, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all economic aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, claiming the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were exporting revolution to the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and serving as a Communist beachhead in the region. A U.S.-imposed trade embargo followed in 1985. The measures, together with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras and Sandinista government mismanagement and corruption, almost scuttled the economy. About half of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s budget now goes to the fight against the Contras. `` The economic situation, the hunger, the misery has gathered momentum by all citizens, and we were tapping it,'' said another opposition leader, <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, supermarket shelves stand bare. The nation that once exported rice and cotton has now turned to foreign donations for basic food staples. Children rummage through trash piles seeking scraps of food and the average worker does n't earn enough to feed his family.

<HEAD>Richards Promises `Very Direct' Keynote Address</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> on Sunday tried out the podium she will use for Monday night's keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, and promised a `` very direct'' message in her own homespun style. `` It's my speech. No one has seen it, and no one has given me advice,'' she said. `` I want to lay it all out and put it on a level that everyone will understand.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said she will direct her address to her parents in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and to a family in the same area who recently wrote her a letter about their economic problems and concerns about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national pride. The 20-minute speech will be simple and will be sprinkled with `` Texanisms,'' she said, adding, `` I wish I were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, but I'm not.'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the highest woman elected official in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and a likely candidate for governor in 1990, is a staunch feminist, and said her selection to deliver the high-profile keynote address has jangled her nerves. `` I think it's one of the most difficult things I carry with me all the time,'' she said. `` I feel very strongly that I do n't want to fail. I always want to do well because then they'll think, ` Well, she can do it, maybe some other women can, too.''

 An Atlanta-bound jetliner made an unscheduled stop Sunday to remove a passenger for hitting a flight attendant over the correct change for a drink, an airline spokesman said. The unidentified man was escorted off the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane about 5:45 a.m., said security personnel at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. No injuries to the male attendant were reported. The passenger was not arrested. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the flight, traveling from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> with 183 passengers and a crew of eight, was delayed more than three hours. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the passenger `` argued with a male flight attendant, apparently over the correct change on liquor money. Apparently it was a rather heated argument. The word we have is that the passenger hit the flight attendant.'' The captain landed at the nearest airport to have the passenger removed, said Lt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON>, an airport security officer. `` They had a small fisticuff on board,'' he said. `` All we did was board the plane. The captain asked that we escort him off and we did.'' Fields said the investigation has been turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> because the incident took place in the air.

 Beneath the convention podium is a maze of rooms where speakers try on clothes, get made up in plastic barber's chairs, and rehearse their delivery as coaches warn: `` Do n't get carried away with the ad-libs. `` We want to make sure people look easy and confident and not uncomfortable,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> media consultant and head coach. `` Many people will only be seeing this through the eyes of a camera. I do n't want -LRB- TV viewers -RRB- to be distracted.'' The rehearsal room, identified by a green magic marker sign, is one of several makeshift preparation areas beneath the podium. There is a makeup room boasting two plastic barber's chairs and some lights, a tastefully furnished conversation area draped off from the cables and pre-stressed concrete beams, and a yellow and white holding tent filled with a motley assortment of couches, end tables and potted plants. Mirrors, telephones and portable toilets are also among the amenities provided for those scheduled to speak. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the keynote speaker, told reporters Sunday she was going under the podium to try on jackets to see which color looked best. The rehearsal room itself is equipped with a white plasterboard replica of the podium, built to scale. A television screen provides a simultaneous and sometimes unsettling view of speakers as they rehearse. On either side of the podium is a TelePrompter mirror reflecting the words of their speeches. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Raiser </PERSON>, the finance chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had written the word `` turn'' into his speech at periodic intervals as a reminder to shift his gaze from right to left or vice versa. `` Once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> told Raiser, trying to be encouraging. As Raiser launched into his brief remarks for what seemed the millionth time, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> paced, fidgeted and adjusted the TelePrompTer. `` He's got it,'' he said suddenly to <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, assigned to `` punch up'' speeches and, sometimes, to cut them. `` How are we doing?'' `` 3:40,'' Buck replied. `` We've got to pick up the pace,'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He directed Buck to do some trimming _ `` little surgicals'' _ and advised <PERSON> Raiser </PERSON>, `` Do n't get carried away with the ad-libs.'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, Buck and a battery of computer operators and technicians started rehearsing people last Wednesday and wo n't be finished until Thursday, the last day of the convention. `` We're not going to see the convention. We'll read about it in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Buck, whose regular job is administrative assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` By Thursday night I'll qualify for my voter registration card at the Omni,'' said <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. `` By the way, what's it like in the outside world?'' Replied Buck, `` Someone said it was snowing.''

<HEAD>Jackson Says Minority Platform Planks `Are Majority Opinions'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday his minority platform planks `` are majority positions'' that deserve to be debated and decided by the full convention. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign's minority report on 13 disputed issues Sunday, but said compromises still were possible to avert floor fights Tuesday. Resolution of the lingering platform disputes must await a settlement of the larger differences between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the certain nominee, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Even then, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made clear Sunday that he wants the Democrats to debate his bedrock issues, especially his call for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations and a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> freeze. `` The fact is minority planks will be debated and deliberated upon and decided by the convention,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation. `` Our minority planks are majority positions. For example, most Americans do not want any more taxes on the middle class and poor people, but corporations and the wealthy must pay their share,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has said repeatedly it will not accept <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for higher taxes, a five-year freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and support of self-determination for the Palestinians. The minority report carries the disclaimer: `` These minority positions are under discussion by the parties for possible agreements on language that may lead to their inclusion in the platform.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, chairman of the platform committee, said Saturday night, `` It's really in the hands of the campaigns now.'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> predicted in an interview that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does press floor fights on all 13 issues, `` he might win one or two.'' Some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> minority planks cover less thorny domestic issues that lend themselves more readily to compromise. These included <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for full funding of Head Start, pre-natal care and the Women, Infants and Children program, doubling the education budget, and creation of a national health program. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager, told reporters the platform negotiations suspended Tuesday `` are not moving forward.'' `` Until we have resolved the broader issues of the relationship between <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, more importantly the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its crucial progressive wing ... to pursue detailed discussions on the platform just do n't make sense,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, predicted that if the two candidates come to terms, compromise language can be found for more than half the disputed planks. At a dinner for the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hosted by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Saturday night, both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates seemed pleased with their handiwork. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s going to have to send a cue as to what he would like his representatives and delegates to do about the platform, and that has n't come down yet.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a co-chair of the platform committee, said, `` I think there may be a skirmish on the defense and the revenue issue, but once that chemistry returns between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, then I think everything will work out.'' The platform writers were in a self-congratulatory mood. `` Well, platform people, we did it, did n't we? Did n't we do a good job? It's probably the only platform in the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that just says, ` Good morning, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we love ya,''' said Rep. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaughter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We're right on the edge of something absolutely wonderful.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> analyst, told the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, `` Both the choice of Sen. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and the platform that you've written ... have a message to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. Those are Democrats who are not liberals. There are tens of millions of them.'' `` The message is, ` Come home. There is no ideological test. We're not going to ask you complicated questions. We want your votes, your confidence. The only thing that we require is that you want to change the direction of this country,''' said <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. The majority platform report, hammered out last month in <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, runs fewer than 4,500 words _ a tenth the size of the turgid 1984 platform and the Democrats' shortest election blueprint since the 1930s Without mentioning <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it commits the party `` to reverse seven years of ` voodoo economics,' ` trickle down' politics, fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violence against poor and working people.'' It calls for `` more stable defense budgets.''

<TEXT>
 Rehabilitation specialists say that because of the drought they are seeing more cases of young people diving into shallow water, striking bottom and becoming paralyzed with spinal injuries. `` These are usually young people who dive in a particular spot for years with no problem. But they hit bottom this year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maiman </PERSON>, chief of the spinal cord injury center at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maiman </PERSON> said colleagues in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have noted similar increases in diving accidents. `` It's amazing how far-reaching the affects of the drought are,'' <PERSON> Maiman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunelius </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said low water levels are creating new ripples and currents that are disguising river bottoms and obstacles. Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marshfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> neurosurgeon, said diving accidents often paralyze more severely than auto accidents, the leading cause of such injuries. That is because they often injure vertebrae in the neck, causing quadriplegia, or lack of movement or sensation from the neck down rather than just the lower body. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON>, a rehabilitation counselor at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in Madison who uses a wheelchair because of injuries suffered in a lake diving accident at age 14, said there were three 15-year-olds in rehabilitation there who suffered permanent injuries from diving into shallow water. `` I'm hearing a lot of conversations from patients who say they dove in a particular area 10,000 times and never had a problem, but this spring they were hitting bottom,'' <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> said. `` Most people who hurt their spine in a diving accident suffer permanent injuries.'' <PERSON> Eckert </PERSON> said the victims have ranged from 15 to 31 years old. `` People in that age group are more willing to take risks,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A spill of more than 600,000 gallons of crude oil in the harbor has killed a small number crabs, birds and other wildlife, officials said. `` The effect of the spill on the wildlife is n't that great because it happened in the harbor,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinkinsop </PERSON>. `` There's not that many species of wildlife there.'' A tanker carrying crude oil from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> rammed a refinery dock Wednesday, opening a gash that allowed 15,350 barrels of oil, or 644,700 gallons, to gush into the ship channel. The spill closed the port for 56 hours. Volunteers sounded a propane cannon and air horns Saturday to scare birds away from the oily marsh near the dock. `` I've found quite a few blue crabs, fiddler crabs and one hermit crab dead in the marshy area,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, environmental contaminant specialist for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. In addition, he said at least two birds and an opossum died as a result of the spill. `` There have probably been more than two birds killed, because when birds are injured, they're vulnerable to prey and so they hide and we might not have found them yet,'' <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. In the long term, `` there will be a reduction in food sources, such as plankton, needed by such organisms as shrimp and crabs,'' he said. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, district manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said no dead fish have been spotted. Fish were not affected because a southeasterly wind carried the oil immediately to the north shore of the harbor, he said. `` The fish had other places they could go in the harbor,'' he said. `` Fish have a kind of avoidance factor in their movement.''

Two unions representing about 70 percent of the air controllers _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> and another known as the <ORGANIZATION> CFDT </ORGANIZATION> _ said they were canceling the strike in response to a letter Sunday from Transport Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> promised a series of meetings to find solutions to the problems. But the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>, affiliated with the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, said the 16 percent of controllers it represents would stay off the job. The union said <PERSON> Delabarre </PERSON>'s letter was `` a gesture of good will'' but offered no new proposals. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, the state-owned international and domestic airlines, said there was no time to reschedule previously canceled flights. `` We've got the planes, but we have to put together the crews,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Couturier </PERSON>. `` There's also no way to alert the passengers.'' He said the airline did not expect to be able to restore very many of the canceled flights. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> dropped 90 of its 138 flights scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said it would cancel all but 80 of its 347 flights. Foreign airlines flying to and from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also canceled most of their flights or diverted them to cities in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The three unions have different demands, which include hiring more controllers.

 Fire engulfed a chemical storage tank in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> Sunday, producing a cloud of acrid black smoke that prompted thousands of people to flee in panic, police said. No serious injuries were reported and authorities said the smoke was not toxic.

 A Sioux Indian who accurately predicted rain last month fulfilled another promise with a rain prayer ceremony that was followed about 90 minutes later with a shower that at least momentarily broke the drought. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Dog </PERSON> smoked a ceremonial pipe and spread spring water in all four directions and toward the ground and sky in the half-hour ceremony at dusk Saturday.

Two months before the shooting, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> had doused Miss <PERSON> Kudelycz </PERSON> with gasoline and tried to set her afire, police said. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> was arrested in that incident and jailed, but Miss Kudelycz dropped the charges.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of demonstrators chanting `` Free <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>!'' thronged <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> on Sunday to mark the 70th birthday of the jailed South African leader. It was one of the biggest anti-apartheid rallies ever in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Against a backdrop of flags of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> led the rally in chants that echoed across central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` In 25 years in jail, he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has not spoken to the public, yet many people not born then have been inspired by him,'' declared <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. `` This man is head and shoulders above any contemporary leader in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. `` Any sensible government would realize that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is absolutely essential for peace and stability in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> turns 70 on Monday. He was jailed in 1962 for leaving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> illegally and inciting unrest. While serving a five-year sentence, he was given a life term in 1964 for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government banned all major birthday celebrations for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement is outlawed there. Organizers arranged a last-minute concert Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>, but police stopped it about two hours after it began. The audience of 500 left peacefully. Dozens of foreign governments called for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release in recent days. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, `` It distresses one to realize that you mark the birthday in a prison dungeon into which you were thrown by the racists more than a quarter of a century ago.'' `` Soviet people firmly demand your release, <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and the release of all political prisoners in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a telegram Sunday, which was published by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` I give you a strong handshake.'' In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, thousands jammed piazzas for a Saturday night concert in <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> and another one Sunday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Dutch and Swedish anti-apartheid movements scheduled events for Monday. In central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, traffic was snarled as the demonstrators, headed by 25 activists who had marched 500 miles from <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, poured into <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> Park under rainy skies. The organizers, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the crowd at 250,000 people, but police put the figure at only 30,000. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard reported three arrests on minor offenses. The mostly young, white crowd swayed as a South African band belted out African nationalist themes from the podium, which was ringed with red and black tribal warrior shields. They roared with approval as the face of <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the jailed leader's wife, flashed on a giant video screen. In a message taped in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, she said her husband's birthday `` relates to a symbol of resistance in this country.'' `` We are very moved, very touched, by this gesture,'' she said, expressing thanks `` to the entire international community'' for applying pressure for her husband's release. Security forces, some in armored vehicles, patrolled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s major black townships Sunday, although there were no reports of violence. Police also set up several roadblocks, including one outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is held. Six other purple-robed bishops, in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Lambeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> bishops held every 10 years, joined <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> on the podium. They sat with labor union activists, opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General Sir <PERSON> Shridath </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, whose film on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, `` Cry Freedom,'' has attracted huge audiences. The crowd cheered as speakers denounced Western leaders, particularly <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, for refusing to impose tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has refused an offer of release by the South African government on the condition he renounces violence, saying that the real prepetrators of violence are South African authorities. South African diplomat <PERSON> Justus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Goede </PERSON>, the second-ranking official at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said in a radio interview the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was committed to the violent overthrow of the government, and noted that bomb and grenade attacks by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas were increasing. `` I think it is asking a great deal of any government to knowingly release the leader of an organization which has this political manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Goede </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government and its system of apartheid, under which the country's 26 million blacks have no voice in national The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and districts. In addition to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> and Danish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Uffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellemann-Jensen </PERSON> all called Sunday for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release.

 This is what <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has become: Suspicious: Before <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marquis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, grown men in dark suits pushed ball point pens into the soil of hundreds of planters hanging off the balconies on each of 46 floors. This unusual method of aerating the soil was a check for explosives. Helpful: The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> delegation, in a superbly crafted handbook, advises conventioneers to wear light clothing _ good advice in 90 plus temperatures _ and to wear comfortable shoes for considerable walking on unforgiving concrete floors. The best advice of all, however, is: `` Find the Rest Rooms. This will save time.'' Hospitable: A sign at The Tattletale, a strip joint, reads: `` Welcome delegates.'' But not all. One delegate to the Democratic National Convention is 18 years old, too young for such educational enterprises. Besides, <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, possibly prefers other entertainments. A collector's paradise: One of the most active subcultures at the convention is the button collector. He prowls the hard concrete of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the news media do their work in blue-curtained enclaves, sniffing out new sources the way a pig goes for truffles. `` You got any buttons?'' has replaced `` When's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> coming? as a topic. At <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, more than a day before the first sound of the gavel at the convention, a hand-lettered sign frostily declared `` No More Buttons!'' A protest site: A pro-marijuana group of hippies clad in tie-dyed garments is staging the `` Alternative Convention'88'' just three blocks from The Omni. Saturday was human rights day for the Alternatives. Sunday was Animal Rights Day, and Monday will be particularly busy as No Nukes, Native American Rights and Environmental Day complete with music from the Plutonium Players. On Saturday, urine testing was a major point of contention for the Alternative platform, and marijuana was touted as both a `` safe drug'' and, in a hemp form, as a cheap source of paper products. Some 75 groupies heard philosopher and former drug guru <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> say that at the Democratic convention, `` Ai n't going to be no one thinking for themselves.'' That did not keep him from showing up at a convention party _ perhaps to check out the thinking. A walk down memory lane: The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, home for 3,500 news people, is so big that the fire department insisted on partitioning it with street names. There is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulevard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Avenue, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Road </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Latimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Latimore </PERSON>, a party staff member, got in there, it is said, because they ran out of Democratic presidential names. Non-winning nominees like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> apparently never were considered. Demopolitically Aware: <PERSON> Gorin </PERSON>'s ice cream put its analysis of the political situation into its product, creating `` Dukakis Delight'' a mixture of strawberry and chocolate _ those being the favorites of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor and his wife. Cynics suggested the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> treat would typically be bland and boring. There was no sign of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Rainbow sherbet. Almost, but not quite ready: It was ever thus, but come opening day, Monday, for better or worse, the 40th Democratic National Convention, the first in the South since 1972, will open in a splash of rose, sky-blue and pink. Visitors are told those podium colors truly are patriotic, that they will be the traditional red, white and blue to the folks watching on TV. The delegate seats, however, are covered with the real red, white and blue. The Omni, usually home to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION>, may well be the smallest hall for a Democratic political convention in modern times. The scoreboard high overhead betrays its heritage, with ads for <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> cigarettes, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> _ the hometown product _ and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which also makes its home here.

 Voters ranked the economy their top concern _ followed by family issues and defense _ in a Gallup poll sponsored by the nation's largest organization of retirees. <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>, the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday the survey of 1,500 voters indicated `` family issues are especially important to marginal or swing voters, including Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984.'' The Gallup organization, in a telephone survey conducted June 14-19, asked voters to rate issues they regarded as `` one of the most important factors determining your vote.'' Almost two-thirds, 65 percent, picked economic issues. Forty-six percent cited family issues, compared with 44 percent who said defense and 36 percent foreign policy. <PERSON> Deets </PERSON> said nearly 500 of the 4,162 delegates to the Democratic National Convention belong to the <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION>, which boasts a membership of 28 million people 50 and older. The organization held a briefing Sunday for several dozen delegates on three of its main concerns: long-term care, safeguarding Social Security and improving private pensions, and health care costs. An AARP-Gallup analysis of the survey said, `` Older respondents are more concerned about health care costs, retirement income and the costs of long-term care. Younger respondents are more concerned about employment opportunities, college costs, the costs of buying a house and child care.''

 Police charged a black man with murdering a black woman that investigators thought was possibly racially motivated because the letters `` KKK'' were carved on her leg. Detective <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Turck </PERSON> said Sunday that any racial motive in the death of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>, 19, had been ruled out and that a drug link was suspected. Police arrested <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, 29, late Saturday. He appeared before a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge Sunday, but his arraignment was postponed until Monday after he asked for an attorney. No bond was set and he remained in jail. `` There is evidence of drug use and abuse throughout this case,'' <PERSON> Turck </PERSON> said. `` Both persons have been known to use drugs in the past.'' Police said <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and the victim were acquaintances. They were both seen at a tavern last Monday night, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s body was found the next day a few blocks away. The carving of Klan initials on her leg was revealed by police last Thursday. Also charged in the case was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON>, 41, who police described as a transient and former psychiatric patient. <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON>, who is white, was charged with sexually abusing the victim's corpse and was jailed pending a psychological examination. <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> told a radio station in an interview last week that he thought Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s body was a life-sized pornographic doll, and that he called police when he saw a head wound. Police Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggens </PERSON> said investigators suspect the letters may have been carved on the victim after she was killed. Police obtained a handwriting sample from <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> and were awaiting test results to determine whether his handwriting matches the writing style of the person who scratched `` KKK'' on <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s body, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prizzia </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON>'s father told the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeman </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the week that his daughter had fallen victim to drugs. `` I'm almost positive it was a drug rub,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> said Preliminary autopsy results indicated Miss <PERSON> Kithcart </PERSON> was strangled and struck on the head with a blunt instrument, police said. <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> is located about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, on the opposite shore of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Last November, 16-year-old <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, was found with the letters `` KKK'' and racial epithets scrawled in a charcoal-like substance on her skin after being missing for four days. She later said she had been abducted and raped by a group of white men, but she and her family have refused to cooperate with a state investigation.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, in a convention-eve pep talk, told state delegation leaders Sunday to think of the convention as a four-day television miniseries with the delegates as the live audience. `` We have worked together for four years for this week,'' he said. `` Remember ... you never get a second chance to make a first impression.'' He asked the delegates to stay in their seats. `` For the people who came to party, there is plenty of opportunity next door,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. Next door to the Omni Coliseum, where the convention opens Monday, is a huge hall whose rooms have been reserved for parties and other events. The delegation leaders were told that each evening's convention session should be regarded as two segments, the important one being the two hours when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> are putting it on the air. `` Between 9 and 11,'' the instruction went, `` we are going to have to be jam up and jelly tight to get everything we want in there.''

 Police determined to avoid `` blood in the streets'' canceled a march and rally by white supremacists Sunday after helmeted officers used riot shields to shove aside hundreds of anti-racist demonstrators. The leader of the white supremacist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, later was taken into protective custody by police. There was frequent shoving between police and counterdemonstrators but no reports of violence or injuries outside the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state Capitol, where the opposing groups gathered. The spot is a half-mile from the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION>, where the Democratic National Convention opens Monday. The entire Capitol was roped off as anti-racist contingents were confined to either end of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, separated by police in riot gear. As temperatures rose above 90, the protesters, representing a variety of groups, chanted such slogans as `` No <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>, no Fascist <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag and a Confederate flag were burned in the street as hundreds of reporters looked on. Bare-chested, shaggy youths danced wildly and chanted as others beat drums and played flutes. Police with helmets and riot shields pushed the crowd back at one point. Firecrackers popped and mounted police moved in, then left the area. `` This was a hostile, angry, nasty crowd and that's why we canceled the march,'' said Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>. `` It was a tough call because this is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said, but he said he was determined to avoid `` blood in the streets of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' After the cancellation, about 250 counterdemonstrators marched from the Capitol to the official protest zone near the convention center, chanting `` We just took the Klan's march.'' Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he did not think the cancellation amounted to a failure of security. `` I think that shows the system worked,'' he said. `` We're here to provide security for the people and also to protect them and to see that everybody has a good time and nobody gets hurt.'' Convention security spokeswoman <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, chief organizer of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> march and no relation, was taken into protective custody when he entered the protest zone. About 30 of his backers carrying Confederate battle flags tried to march to the protest zone despite the cancellation. The anti-racist protesters surrounded them but police separated the two groups again before there was any violence. The white supremacist marchers were then taken back to their cars by police bus, and there were no arrests, police said. `` If our Lord <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> can ride into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on the back of a donkey, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> can drive down <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> in his Chevrolet pickup truck,'' protested <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> before he was taken into custody. `` This is a shameful act on the part of the city,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, regarding the cancellation. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> has gone to court several times on behalf of white supremacists' free speech rights. `` The presence of 200 counterdemonstrators is no reason to cancel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Constitution,'' he said. `` That's the same argument -LRB- they -RRB- used to cancel civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s.'' `` They -LRB- white supremacists -RRB- wanted to have a rally on this very spot,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, one of the anti-racist groups. `` And look who's here We feel it's very important that when the Klan comes out, they must always know that people wo n't idly sit by.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he was held at the <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> for four hours in what he called `` police oppression.'' `` Freedom is n't free, and sometimes you've got to pay the price,'' said <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, who said his pickup truck was vandalized while he was in jail. `` I paid mine today. But like <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>, I shall return.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said he planned to hold a news conference Monday morning in the <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat of <PERSON> Cumming </PERSON>, site of a huge civil rights protest in January 1987, to discuss the incidents Sunday. Sunday marked the first day of scheduled protests in the two-acre parking lot across the street from the convention where city authorities are providing a stage and sound equipment for groups to demonstrate at two-hour intervals. About 20 people _ not including reporters _ showed up in broiling heat as the Coalition to Support Cuban Detainees began the protests. The Mad Housers, a homeless relief group based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, built a small red, white and blue hut as an example of the structures they put up for homeless people in the city. About 120 people carrying signs and chanting slogans marched from <LOCATION> Atlanta-Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> to the protest zone to demonstrate against Ethiopian control of the Eritrean region of north <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In other demonstrations: _ LEGAL, a gay rights group, pressed for more efforts to cure AIDS and for an end to discrimination against homosexuals Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., a sponsor of major AIDS funding legislation, told a crowd of about 2,000 people, `` We must not be overly cautious in battling this killer'' and urged more experimentation with different possible cures for AIDS <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tex. </LOCATION>, a gay rights activist for 26 years, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is not as sensitive to the brothers and sisters who have died of AIDS as you and I have become.'' Many demonstrators wore pink triangles similar to those <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> forced homosexuals to wear in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. _ Radio personality <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON> was among the speakers for Compassion Campaign'88, an animal rights group The organization is promoting legislation to outlaw steel-jawed leg traps, use of `` veal cages'' that hold calves immobile to keep their flesh tender, and some chemical tests on animals. `` We can begin to start thinking about stopping wars when we stop killing the creatures we share the earth with, the animals,'' said <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, who hosts a nationally syndicated Top 40 radio program. _ A planned march and rally by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION> was canceled because the heat was too intense for some for the group's elderly members

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, vowing to `` launch a winning campaign'' for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sunday to claim the Democratic nomination for president. He said he wanted to meet with rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a bid to assure convention-week unity. `` We're working hard to make sure we have a good convention, a strong and <ORGANIZATION> united </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said after he and ticketmate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> touched down in their chartered <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent his day moving triumphantly around town, holding the convention-city spotlight even if he was far short of the delegates needed to dislodge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hold on the nomination. `` This is not a coronation,'' he said, `` this is a convention.'' The runner-up in the primary season said it was `` too much to expect'' a party gathering without debate. `` That is in the highest and best traditions of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, although he predicted there would be unity by the end of the week. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he thought the Democrats were showing more unity than in any time in the past 20 years, adding, `` The tide is really moving with us.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talked by phone during the day, and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said, `` We'll probably be talking a little later this evening'' by phone. He added, `` I'm sure we're going to be meeting during the course of the convention.'' Advisers to the two men met for more than an hour in a downtown hotel. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Delmarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said she expected a Monday morning meeting. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp also worked to create the impression of a campaign looking toward the fall election. Senior aide <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON> announced that 35 state field directors met during the day. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advisers would be among those yet to be named. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ during farewell remarks from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ seemed to stiffen in the face of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s continuing demands. `` You ca n't have two quarterbacks,'' he said in a blunt assessment of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for `` shared responsibility.'' He added, `` Every team has to have a quarterback; that's the nominee.'' He added, `` No Democratic convention would be a Democratic convention without a little controversy.'' As for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, `` We know each other, we like each other, we respect each other.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> passed the word that Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> would introduce <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to the convention on Thursday, a gesture of unity by a man passed over when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picked his running mate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s nomination was assured, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his aides held out the possibility of a challenge just the same. Some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s backers cautioned against pressing too hard. `` There is a danger in taking your followers to the brink,'' said <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate. Countered Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` does n't know how to communicate with Southern blacks All the blacks he talks to are <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> grads. He needs to sit down with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> professed optimism that a convention collision with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could be avoided. `` I think the process is under way and we're certainly reaching out to Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' he said. Thousands of delegates flooded into heat-drenched <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in plenty of time to sample the tourist attractions and restaurants before settling down to the business of anointing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as their man to lead the fall campaign against Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> may have spoken for many when he said, `` I've checked in and I'm headed for the bar.'' At the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state Capitol, police equipped with riot shields intervened to prevent violence between white supremacists and counter-demonstrators. Authorities revoked a permit held by the supremacists because they said they could n't guarantee their safety. `` It was a tough call because this is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Public Safety Commissioner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Napper </PERSON> after taking supremacist leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> into protective custody. He said he was determined to prevent `` blood in the streets of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> called it `` police oppression.'' Advocates for Cuban detainees and a homeless relief group called the `` Mad Housers'' demonstrated outside the hall in a parking lot set aside by city authorities for protests. The latest polling information was good for the Democrats. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> indicated that the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket led <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ accounting for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The survey showed the Democrats running even or slightly ahead in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state and behind in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` This is a week we've been looking forward to for a long, long time,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said at a low-key airport welcome in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We hope and expect to launch a winning campaign.'' Just before leaving <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters, `` I'm looking forward to the week. He said, `` I'm on my way to a convention where, if everything goes well, I'm going to be the Democratic presidential nominee. That's never happened to me before.'' The <PERSON> Omni </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was ready to receive the assemblage, a basketball arena transformed into a made-for-television facility. `` When we made the selection -LRB- of the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> -RRB- we loooked at this hall as a television studio,'' said party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. A parade of convention speakers took turns practicing their remarks party in a rehearsal room beneath the podium. Keynote speaker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said she was there to decide which color jacket would look best on television. Party elders made the rounds of the morning talk shows, predicting the convention would end in unity. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would inflict political damage on himself it he demanded `` selfish things for himself that are divisive in nature ... He's not going to make that kind of mistake.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> spoke on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' `` In my judgment, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will deliver one of the great unity speeches ever delivered at a Democratic convention,'' agreed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former party chairman. Former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>, who has represented <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the peace-making talks, said he is optimistic the differences can be worked out before the opening gavel falls on Monday. The man Republicans will name to run against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was fishing in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He'll be back campaigning on Wednesday, the day Democrats make it official and bestow their nomination on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In his morning talk show appearance, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was sure the Democrats would wind up with a unified convention _ eventually. `` At this point there is no defined place for the progressive wing in the campaign,'' he said. `` Our minority planks are majority positions,'' he said. `` ... It's too much to expect that we not debate and deliberate and arrive at decisions and arrive at a mandate to govern. That is in the highest and best traditions of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

At the military strip, five soldiers armed with automatic rifles escorted <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> and his entourage in a hut and detained them for an hour until <PERSON> Melhuish </PERSON> and Zimbabwean officials arrived. Soldiers trained AK-47 weapons on <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s group while it was waiting. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> told a corporal in camouflage fatigues that he would lodge an official protest. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s party and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officials refused further comment.

 Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> on Sunday began a visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that was expected to create friction over the crackdown on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators. A soldier shot and killed a Palestinian who allegedly tried to grab his rifle. Also Sunday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> appeared to break new ground by saying he was willing to negotiate separately with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives. Previously, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and other leaders have called for talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> was the most senior foreign leader to visit the Jewish state since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8. The Dutch leader hinted from the outset he would be critical of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s handling of the uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, in which 223 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. `` To disagree is a privilege of friends,'' <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said during a welcoming ceremony near Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office. `` We are with you even if we speak up. We speak up because we are with you.'' Later, at a state dinner given by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said of the Israeli response to the uprising: `` The harsh measures that have been taken in attempting to normalize the situation have left disturbing images in the minds of many of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s friends.'' He also called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to participate in an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference that would be under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices and to withdraw from the occupied lands in exchange for peace. `` Claiming peace but denying land will be in our view incompatible,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> opposes an international peace conference that would include the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the four other permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, saying concessions would be demanded that would jeopardize the Jewish state. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, also has said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not withdraw from the occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> acknowledged he disagreed with the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> leader on some <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issues but said he hoped the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> would defend <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against the `` campaign of vilification that is being waged against us on that continent.'' Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for about 30 minutes and they agreed to postpone working discussions until Monday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said. In the latest violence, a soldier in the Israeli town of <ORGANIZATION> Petach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> fatally shot a Palestinian after the man jumped him from behind, grabbed his throat and tried to steal his rifle, police said.

 The organizer of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s first crusade outside his home state since the evangelist was defrocked said he expects thousands of followers to defy the Assemblies of God church and attend the event. The Rev. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>, pastor of the independent <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and organizer of the July 22-24 crusade at Market Square Arena, says he believes about 8,000 people will attend each of the three meetings planned this weekend. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has not preached outside <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> since February, when he tearfully admitted sinning against <PERSON> God </PERSON> and his family. A prostitute in suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, paid her to perform lewd acts. The Assemblies of God dismissed <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on April 8, after he refused an order to refrain from preaching for a year and receive professional counseling. He returned to the pulpit of his independent ministry May 22. <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the Assemblies of God headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said individual pastors must decide whether to support the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> crusade. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> here `` made a decision not to cooperate'' with the crusade in any way, said <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, an aide to the Rev. <PERSON> Blanche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiscus </PERSON>. `` Pastors have had instructions'' from the national and state offices of the Assemblies of God not to have anything to do with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> activities, <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said. `` I would be surprised if any Assemblies of God people attended,'' she added. The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, district superintendent of the Pentecostal denomination, also said pastors have been advised not to support or cooperate with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` He has been disciplined by the church and is n't part of our fellowship,'' <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500 volunteers, 200 ushers and a security force to help with the weekend revival meetings. `` Market Square Arena provides a security force -LRB- for the arena -RRB-, but we provide one for the security of <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>,'' he said. `` You always end up with some people who are hecklers,'' <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> said, adding that he is concerned some people might try to bring banners derogatory to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> into the arena. The Rev. <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the non-denominational <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> said she believes many members of the Assemblies of God will turn out for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` I think a lot of them will go,'' she said. `` Preachers are no different from the laity.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> transformed a Sunday evening reception by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> to honor civil rights heroes into a fund-raiser for a political action committee he intends to develop after the convention ends this week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the PAC will focus on economic issues, the 1990 census and reapportionment of congressional districts. He set the goal of raising $ 2 million in 400 contributions of $ 5,000 apiece to form the `` Keep Hope Alive PAC.'' Staffers began distributing enrollment forms and envelopes for contributions, and he said $ 100,000 already had been raised a week ago. `` We get our mandate from <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamer </ORGANIZATION>, ... from Dr. -LRB- Martin Luther -RRB- King,'' he said in a pre-emptive defense of the formation of the PAC. Ms. <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON> led and won a credentials battle at the 1968 convention to seat members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> instead of the regular state delegation. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>'s goal would be to get more blacks and other minorities to run for office. `` Only by running are you going to open up this process,'' he told the crowd of about 500 at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> building who had come to pay tribute to the `` Drum Majors of the Dream.'' Eight individuals, including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> were honored for their roles in the civil rights movement of the'60s. With former rival Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at the podium, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke pointedly about the tensions and negotiations going on between his campaign staff and those of the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We are at a moment of deliberation, development and challenge,'' he said. `` We are just an attitude away from the White House.'' In a reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said the issues facing the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were bigger than any one person. `` The issue is having a seat in the budget next January. We can cut the defense budget without cutting our defense,'' he said. He acknowledged that the right wing of the party had been accommodated in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate but said, `` You need two wings to fly.'' `` We can afford to lose a vote on the floor but not our integrity,'' he added. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also warned that the PAC would hold accountable those Democratic officeholders coming to the convention as super delegates from areas where he won a significant percentage of the vote in the primaries and caucuses. `` We must visit those senators and governors whose states we won but are not voting for us and find out what their plans are for the future for private and public life.''

 More than 400 members of the <LOCATION> Rittenhouse </LOCATION> clan, some from as far away as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, gathered to share family gossip and history over the weekend at the tricentennial celebration of <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenhausen </PERSON>'s arrival in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

Although family members began tracing their ancestors more than 100 years ago, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rittenhouse </PERSON> recently found a `` missing link'' in 19th-century documents from <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Insurance Companies: AIDS Screenings Help Pinpoint Other Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some insurance companies say that testing more applicants for exposure to AIDS has benefited the industry by helping identify other applicant health problems, such as cocaine use and diabetes. Life and health insurers are using the opportunity offered by increased AIDS testing to perform more general screenings on the blood and urine of applicants. When abnormal readings turn up, insurers sometimes deny applications for coverage or charge higher premiums, industry officials said. `` AIDS is the best thing that ever happened to the life-insurance industry,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plainville </LOCATION>. `` It's the best thing as far as underwriting. Insurance companies can now underwrite with much more information.'' Until recent years, a consumer could buy several hundred thousand dollars of life insurance by answering medical questions on an application, without submitting to blood or urine tests. But with growing concern about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, companies began requiring AIDS antibody tests of applicants for amounts of life insurance above certain threshholds, commonly $ 100,000 worth of insurance. Insurers also often require AIDS tests of people applying for individual health policies. Travelers, for instance, requires the tests for most of its individual health policies. Companies will not insure people with positive AIDS antibody test results because of the increased likelihood they will develop the syndrome, and they will not insure cocaine users. When insurers require blood to be drawn for an AIDS tests, they generally have a laboratory screen it for other problems, and also order a urine test. A typical blood and urine screening costs the insurer $ 50 to $ 75 per person, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an associate counsel at <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The lab checks blood for sugar levels, fats and protein and looks for signs of cardiovascular disease, liver and kidney disorders. Companies also are checking urine for nicotine, to verify whether people who say they are non-smokers are telling the truth, and for problems associated with heavy drinking. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> said it is rejecting about 3 percent of applications for individual life insurance, compared with 2 percent two years ago, but <PERSON> Testa </PERSON> was not sure how much of the increase is due to increased blood testing. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> would not say how often it denies applications because of positive AIDS tests and said it did not track denials for other medical causes. Travelers said testing is revealing more conditions that warrant higher rates or rejection of an applicant. But spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said that when an insurer knows it is discovering more of its customers' problems through tests, its rates will reflect fewer cost for unknown risks. `` If we can better classify people's mortality risk, actuaries can sharpen their pencils in terms of pricing,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` The better we can underwrite, the more narrowly we can price, and everyone's better off.''
