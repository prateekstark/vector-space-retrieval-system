<HEAD>Space Shuttle in Mothballs at Vandenberg, But Unmanned Launches
Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials announced plans Thursday to increase unmanned launches at this coastal base, after reaffirming a decision to put its space shuttle facilities in mothballs. Col. <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Colitore </PERSON> said at the 25th Annual Space Congress convention Thursday in <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would build one new launch pad and modify another at the base to launch the Titan 4 missile. His statement came a day after Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cromer </PERSON>, chief of the Space and Missile Test Organization at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, reaffirmed a February announcement that the $ 3.5 billion shuttle launch facility at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> was being placed in mothballs because of federal budget cuts. <ORGANIZATION> Cromer </ORGANIZATION> said the move would save the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> $ 40 million in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the shuttle pad to launch other, unmanned missles, Maj. Sgt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zielsdorf </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> spokesman, said Thursday. The Titan 4, the military's workhorse missile, carries huge, shuttle-sized payloads and satellites into orbit. The first planned launch of the Titan 4, which is 20 feet taller than the shuttle at 204 feet, is set for February 1990, <PERSON> Colitore </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also will modify another launch pad for old Titan 2 intercontinental missiles that are being refurbished into space boosters, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, project manager. The first launch of the Titan 2 is set for July 1 at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Colitore </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would increase its unmanned launches at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. The <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> shuttle site has been regularly maintained at a cost of $ 50 million a year since the space shuttle Challenger exploded during launch in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in January 1986, killing the seven people aboard. It was to be the next site of a shuttle launch in July 1986. But after the Challenger disaster, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> moved the launch back to 1992. Now launches have been indefinitely postponed at <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION>, although an August shuttle launch is planned at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Even if <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>'s vast shuttle complex, which includes a launch pad, buildings and runway, were to be reactivated, it would take at least four years for it to be functional, <PERSON> Zielsdorf </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery's first computerized numbers game produced 859 winners Friday night, and that did n't include the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which published a photo of a winning ticket hours before the contest. A photograph at the top of the front page of Friday morning's paper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which proved to be the winning combination in the first Cash 3 contest The photo showed a sample ticket sent to the paper a month ago. `` This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` It does n't seem like that should need to be said, but we've gotten so many calls. The Cash 3 winners will split a total payout of $ 94,090. Sales of the Lotto and Cash 3 tickets began when Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> purchased two Cash 3 betting slips. But the kickoff was delayed several minutes when a computer terminal at the new lottery headquarters refused to issue <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON>'s tickets because the terminal's password had not been entered correctly. Across the state, 3,142 retailers were supposed to be hooked into a central computer to begin dispensing the 50-cent Cash 3 and $ 1 Lotto tickets. Several reported their machines were not working or said they could not get through on a hotline set up by <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is operating the on-line computer system. By 7:30 p.m., $ 616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and $ 345,377 on the Lotto game. `` Most on-line games start out slow and then grow,'' lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. She predicted combined Lotto and Cash 3 sales would surpass $ 10 million in the first eight days of sales, and $ 1 billion in the first year. Thirty-five percent of all lottery revenue is earmarked for public education. Twenty-eight states, including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> games will help undermine illegal numbers rackets. `` Some of the people down here have been playing illegal numbers since they were teen-agers,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Norflett </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> vice squad. `` But if they can find a way to play the same amount, win the same amount and do it legally, I'm reasonably sure a lot of them will switch over and play the legal game or start playing both.'' Cash 3 offers daily top prizes of $ 500. Players pick numbers from 000 to 999. In the Lotto game, players pick six numbers from 1 to 49. The first winning number will be drawn May 7 when the jackpot will be at least $ 2 million, but could reach $ 4 million.

 <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON> is 83 years old, does n't do a lot of driving and gets very few parking tickets. Well, she gets a lot of tickets, actually, but she should n't. Mrs. <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, had a license plate stolen from her 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duster </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> two years ago. By the end of the next day, she had reported the theft to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police and received new plates from the Department of Motor Vehicles. That was not the end of it. Mrs. <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON> has gotten notices from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> about 169 unpaid tickets totaling $ 9,299, including interest and penalties. She tried to explain, but the notices kept coming. A default judgment had been issued, they said. We can take your property and bank accounts, they said. `` I was living in a nightmare,'' she said. Finally through the help of state Sen. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodhue </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON> was given a letter here on Thursday from the parking bureau clearing her of the tickets and saying she did n't owe <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a cent _ for now. `` We solved this, but there is something wrong with the system,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Goodhue </PERSON> said Thursday. She and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, an administrative supervisor for the <ORGANIZATION> PVB </ORGANIZATION> said that as long as someone is still out there with her license plate, the computers say it's her car violating the parking laws And she'll still get dunning notices. `` There is nothing in the system to trip it if someone has reported the car stolen or the plates stolen,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Goodhue </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON> had so much trouble because she had lost the police receipt showing she had reported her car stolen. That infuriates Mrs. <PERSON> Goodhue </PERSON>. `` There should be a system to double check against stolen license plates and stolen cars,'' she said. `` You can have two cars out there with the same plate and the wrong person getting dunned. These things should n't be allowed to continue happening. PVB computers should talk to DMV computers.'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> admitted that there was no mechanical system that would notify PVB that a ticket was given to a stolen car or plate. The burden of proof was on the victim, as it were, to show that the vehicle on the ticket is n't theirs or was n't where the ticket said it was, he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Huitt </PERSON>, now driving a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escort </ORGANIZATION>, says she will frame her `` $ 10,000 letter.'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said she should also hope police find the car with her license plate and destroy that plate so her nightmare can end for good.

<TEXT>
 Palestinian Moslems respond to a prayer call from a minaret and head for a mosque in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A few hundred yards away, ultra-Orthodox Jews dressed in black bow again and again before a stone wall. Arabs and Israelis, enemies but neighbors inside the walls of ancient <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, pass without speaking. Israeli riot police stand guard on rooftops and in alleys, where anti-Israeli graffiti are scrawled on some walls. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is a city both Jews and Moslem passionately claim _ and, reluctantly, share. For the Jews, it is, as the Old Testament's Psalms say, `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, my highest joy.'' For the Moslems, it is `` Al Quds,'' or `` The Holy.'' Its name means `` city of peace,'' but it is at the heart of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. If Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is able to persuade the two sides to sit at a negotiating table, the issue of this city's future is likely to be a major stumbling block Initially settled about 2,500 years before the birth of Christ, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has been beseiged and conquered 37 times by foreign forces, including the Romans, the Crusaders and the Arab general <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>. Today, walled ancient <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> covers a crowded square mile of narrow cobblestone streets, broad courtyards hidden behind locked doors, and a colorful Arab market often shuttered by strikes in the 5-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. Nowhere in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> are Jewish-Arab differences more strongly felt than in the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Hundreds of Palestinian worshipers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops converge each Friday for Moslem prayers at the city's two holiest mosques, the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>, where angry Arab protests often erupt. Tear gas thrown to quell the demonstrations sometimes disturbs Jewish prayers at the adjoining Western Wall, the last remnant of the second Jewish temple destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 and <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine. It is here that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seeks to break the back of the uprising by forcing merchants who supply the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to obey Israeli rule instead of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> orders. Fourteen Arab merchants face up to two years in jail for opening shops during PLO-ordained hours in violation of army orders. As the city grows increasingly tense, however, most of the 17,000 Moslems and 2,000 Jews who live inside ancient <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> say they grow more determined in their commitment to stay. `` The <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tastes of history. In every stone there is a book,'' said Palestinian poet <PERSON> Fawzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON>, born within <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walls 42 years ago `` I do n't live in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> _ it lives in me,'' he said. `` I can never leave.'' For Israeli <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has lived here five years, the soul of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is in its Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall. `` The wall offers solace to so many Jewish people. You see them day after day, talking to God,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 44, a native of <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, Md. `` But the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is more than a shrine. It is my home,'' she said. `` If I am threatened, I will turn into a she-bear.'' The <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was held by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for the first 19 years of Israeli history, until Jewish troops overran it in the 1967 war. Then <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proclaimed the city its capital, a decision that Arabs refuse to recognize. Palestinians in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> still recall <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s conquest with bitterness. <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneineh </PERSON>, 52, said he was forced to leave his apartment after the war when Israelis bought the building where he lived. He moved to <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> but was soon drawn back to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, even though he could afford only two rooms for his family of six. `` Nothing can match the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We will stay here and die here, which will surely happen because blood will be shed over this city.'' Israeli poet <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Amichai </PERSON> sees the problem in dark terms. In his book `` Poems of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' he writes: `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> stone is the only stone that can Feel pain. It has a network of nerves. From time to time <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> crowds into Mass protests like the tower of Babel. And afterward the city disperses, muttering Prayers of complaint and sporadic screams from churches And synagogues and loud-moaning mosques. Each to his own place.'' Palestinian poet <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON> knows <PERSON> Amichai </PERSON>'s poetry and appreciates that others love this city as he does. But he supports the Arab revolt. `` My only fear,'' <PERSON> Bakri </PERSON> said, fingering worry beads, `` is that the uprising brings this city closer to more calamity.''

 The roughly chiseled features and downcast eyes are all that remain as reminders of the little girl who lived here more than 2,000 years ago. Nearby, looking down at her in the excavation, stood another little girl, this one from the modern village that had been built atop the ancient <LOCATION> Saar </LOCATION> burial mounds where the chiseled stone was found in February. The village girl's hair was cut short, like that of the girl in stone; they could have been sisters had they not been born 20 centuries apart. The `` little girl tombstone'' is one of five identified as belonging to the Tylos culture that existed on this island in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> around the time of Christ. The thousands of ancient graves on <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, 30 miles long an 10 miles across at its widest point, once gave rise to a theory that it was used as a regional burying ground. However, the Danish archaeologist <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolich </PERSON>, among others, says, `` There is no existing evidence that requires us to assume that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> island.'' Over the years, many of these burial sites have been obliterated by population and urban growth, a process that continues. The Saar mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own the property and are impatient to have it cleared. `` Our problem is that the construction of new buildings is coming very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON>, the superintendent of archaeology. `` <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> would like to build houses, houses. And everywhere you dig in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, you will find some evidence of the prehistoric or ancient past. `` So we ca n't preserve all the mounds, but we try to do our best to preserve as many as we can.'' At this site, known as the `` baby grave,'' 85 graves radiate from the center of a giant burial mound, with the most recent at the outer edges. Thirty-five jars containing skeletal remains of infants were also found here, giving the site its name. <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON> said some burial jars, pottery and skeletal remains probably will be removed and exhibited in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s new national museum. Ancient writings suggest <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> may have been the Garden of Eden described in the Old Testament. The Sumerians of what is now southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> knew the island as <PERSON> Dilmun </PERSON>, during the Bronze Age, some 4,500 years ago. Succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones, making this a rich area for archaeologists. Although most of the Saar mounds, a few miles west of <LOCATION> Manama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s main city, are older, this particular site dates from the Greco-Roman period, 200 B.C.-200 A.D., when the island was called Tylos. For centuries, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, which is near the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>'s western shore, has been a stopping-off place for traders, merchants, pirates and armies on the move. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> the Great never reached <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> during 13 years of conquering the world as he knew it, but some of his generals did. Along with skeletal remains, the contents of other graves escaped pillage over the years. One family mound has yielded a trove of about 1,000 items _ necklaces, glazed pottery and glassware, some in relatively good condition. The mounds are rounded cones, enclosing burial chambers or grave complexes. From afar, they resemble giant anthills. Up close, they are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance. Some rise to about six feet, others are at ground level. At this site, the chambers are generally below ground, cut into bedrock. <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> still has about 100,000 known burial mounds. In 1880, a British officer-explorer, <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durand </PERSON>, wrote in his journal: `` Mighty mounds, bare of vegetation, tower above the palm groves. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to the sea.'' The 30 Tylos mounds, of which the family site is one, could prove important in the study of the Tylos civilization. <PERSON> Sowaileh </PERSON> said it shows, for example, that people of that time made glazed pottery. `` We also notice a change in burial customs from this period,'' he said. `` People are buried clothed, their positions are changed, so they are placed on their backs, and put into some kind of coffin. We did n't see these things before the Greeks came to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>.'' He said the discovery of more than 300 silver Greek coins, some bearing the likeness of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Great </PERSON>, indicate that ancient Tylos, like modern <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, was a flourishing trade center. Sowaileh, surveying the gravesite as he spoke, said the craftsmanship of such artifacts as the `` little girl tombstone'' is local. `` There are other tombstones, very similar to this one, that have inscriptions in Greek, and must have been made for the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people living here at the time. But they do n't have the facial representation like this one,'' he said of the little girl in stone. The little girl from the village had wandered off by now to rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound. Her past is only now being discovered.

<TEXT>
 The southern Polish mill town of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> where thousands of steelworkers went on strike this week for higher pay was built in the 1950s to be a model socialist community. With a population of 220,000 people, <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> _ the name means <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> _ dates from a Polish government resolution passed in 1949 by the communist government, then entering its Stalinist period. The government's aim was to build a huge steel plant next to the ancient Polish capital of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, then a stronghold of the Roman Catholic intelligentsia class that resisted the communist takeover of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Peasants from around <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> were brought to <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> with promises of a better life. They were to build the town and the steel plant and then work in the factory. The building of the town was celebrated in popular songs of the period and portrayed in many Polish films, including <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>'s `` Man of Marble,'' about a model socialist worker who becomes disillusioned with the system. Today <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> is a drab working-class district which, like the rest of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, suffers from heavy pollution from the plant. The plant's 32,000 workers mostly live in the community. At first <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> was a separate town, but it was incorporated as <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s largest district in 1951. Besides the steel plant named after <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the town features a huge monument to the first Soviet leader. The monument was damaged in a 1979 dynamite attack, but later was restored by authorities. Until 1977, the town had no church in keeping with its model-socialist image. But <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s then-archbishop, Cardinal <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtyla </PERSON>, now Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, worked relentlessly on government authorities for permission to build one. On May 15, 1977, he succeeded and consecrated the ultramodern Church of the Holy Ark, a local landmark and today one of at least five churches in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s twin defeats by the Iraqis on the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> have undermined its strategy that a war of attrition would eventually exhaust <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, military analysts say. `` Time is no longer on our side,'' <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, admitted in a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio interview last week `` That's very indicative that maybe the so-called pragmatists in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are now going to get the upper hand. The Iranians have had a lot of sense knocked into them in the last few weeks,'' said <PERSON> Hans-Heino </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> specialist with the London-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s defeats on land and sea last week were their most serious in several years and analysts believe <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> needs a spectacular operation to regain the initiative in the 7 -LCB- - year-old gulf war <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula, captured by the Iranians in February 1986, was considered a `` strategic boon,'' but not vital. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> force led by units of the elite Presidential Guards seized the peninsula April 16-18. `` Its loss has had a major psychological impact,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s loss of two frigates and a missile boat sunk or disabled by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on April 18 _ in the first serious clash between the <LOCATION> Iranians </LOCATION> and Americans _ is considered more important because those warships can not be replaced. Already, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy suffers a lack of spare parts and missiles, and most of its major surface ships, including two U.S.-built destroyers, are believed non-operational. `` The Iranians are having to rethink their whole strategy,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` They've lost the initiative in many ways and they'll have to do something to get it back. The pressure is on them to pull off something spectacular.'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> and other Western analysts said an escalation in the Iraqis' use of outlawed chemical weapons in recent weeks and a seven-week missile bombardment of Iranian cities has also taken its toll on Iranian morale. A sustained bombing campaign by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s superior air force has damaged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s already battered economy. Prime targets have been oil refineries and installations and power plants. Sources in the petroleum industry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bombing has cut <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refining capacity by about a third. Oil exports, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economic lifeblood, have been disrupted by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids on tankers in the gulf. A drop in demand for oil and increasingly shaky prices on the world market have eroded oil revenue on which the Iranians depend to pay for their war effort. The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry weekly newsletter published in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, reports that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has imported about 3 million barrels of refined petroleum products, such as kerosene and aviation gas, in recent weeks. `` This unprecedented sudden import of gas oil could be due to damage inflicted on Iranian refineries because of the war,'' the newsletter says. Diplomats recently in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reported that almost two-thirds of the country's factories have been shut down by shortages of raw materials and spare parts. Others are operating at half their normal capacity or less. Only factories producing weapons, ammunition and other war-related items are working at full tilt, they said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is also increasingly isolated diplomatically. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s decision on Tuesday to sever its long-touchy relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, citing `` terrorism and subversion,'' was another blow. `` I'm sure other Arab states in the gulf will follow,'' <PERSON> Kopietz </PERSON> said. `` Despite the war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> relies on countries like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for trade and if that's affected it could have very serious repercussions.'' Since April 18, Iranian leaders, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, have been calling on their countrymen to mobilize, vowing revenge against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> states and `` reactionary states'' like <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` We are prepared to conduct military operations on several fronts,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> declared. But the Iranians failed to launch their big winter offensive this year, triggering speculation that despite boasts of having trained 5 million men and women <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is having recruiting problems. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, the Marine officer who commands <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the region, testifed before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recently that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was not capable of launching a major offensive in the foreseeable future because of manpower and materiel problems. Although the Iranians outnumber the Iraqis three-to-one in population, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said `` the fact is that the Iraqis right now have more men under arms than the Iranians do.'' But despite the problems, the analysts do not believe the Iranians are likely give up what Islamic patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> considers a crusade to crush his long-time adversary, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 The grocery cart of the future is here _ a high-tech, video-equipped gadget that can say hello and offer games, shopping tips, sports scores and _ here's the catch _ on-the-spot advertising to the consumer. `` We're expecting it to make shopping more fun, less of a hassle and more efficient for consumers,'' said <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, director for marketing communications at <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which developed the cart. The Chicago-based marketing-research company spent two years inventing the <ORGANIZATION> VideOcart </ORGANIZATION>, with a liquid-crystal-display video screen mounted near the kiddie seat to entertain, inform and offer a few words from the sponsors. Shoppers using <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION>'s VideOcarts will be able to call up store maps, reserve numbers at the deli counter, find out which checkout line is shortest, play tic tac toe or trivia games to pass the time in line, and get the time, weather forecast or sports scores. The carts would be provided free to the supermarkets, with costs paid by advertisers whose commercials could be transmitted nationally by satellite to local supermarkets. The high-tech carts are to be test-marketed this fall in three stores, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said _ one in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, the others in cities not yet chosen. If the test-marketing goes well, <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce the carts in major-city grocery stores in July 1989 and go national in 1991 with carts in 10,000 supermarkets. The video screens will be especially encased to make them `` kid-proof, grape-juice-proof, shock and water resistant,'' with an alarm system to prevent theft, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Ads will make up about 15 percent of the programming. The rest will be entertainment and information services. <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malec </PERSON>, who developed the cart introduced in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week, called it `` the most important new advertising and promotion medium since television.'' Using sensors in the aisles, an ad for coffee or soda pop can be automatically triggered when the cart reaches the area where those products are shelved. The use of in-store advertising _ signs attached to shopping carts, sales pitches on store sound systems and the like _ has burgeoned in recent years, with spending growing 14 percent a year over the past decade to an estimated $ 12.6 billion last year, according to industry estimates. <ORGANIZATION> VideOcart </ORGANIZATION> offers the advantage of packaging the ads with entertainment, said <PERSON> Malec </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION> plans to invest $ 200 million over the next three years in developing the system, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. One food-company official expressed interest in the carts, but said he would want to see the test-market results before making a commitment. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Frahler </PERSON>, retail trade promotion manager for the <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, Ill.-based Kitchens of <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a major frozen baked-goods producer, suggested there might be some confusion as shoppers get used to wheeling and viewing. `` There is probably going to be some bumping into each other,'' said <PERSON> Frahler </PERSON>, who viewed the cart in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But he said `` the concept is fascinating and it seems to be well thought out.''

 Yuppies who ca n't afford to have it all are calling on a new accessory to tone up their image _ a fake cellular phone that's a dead ringer for the must-have gadget. `` We are a status-driven city _ there's no doubt about it,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Neu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> high-tech accessory store. The Cellular Phoney is a realistic copy of the devices that have become standard fixtures in the BMWs and Mercedes of big-city dealmakers. At $ 15.95 for the handset and a fake, stick-on antenna, the fake phones live up to the advertising slogan of `` status without the static,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. She said she has sold hundreds of the fake phones in the last year, although she did not have an exact count. At Art Explosion, another <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> store offering the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoneys </ORGANIZATION>, business is brisk whenever a new shipment arrives, said salesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornmesser </PERSON>. The Cellular Phoneys are made by Faux -LRB- that's French for `` false'' -RRB- Systems in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Altos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. An estimated 40,000 phones have been sold, many in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, another hub of freeway fashion But the items do well wherever the real phones are popular, retailers said. At three Art Explosion outlets in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, several hundred have been sold since the Christmas season, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Widlus </PERSON>, spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Other fake models also are on the market, including just the antenna. Although many people are buying the <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoneys </ORGANIZATION> as gag gifts, some find the gadgets ring true, Ms. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said. `` It's so incredibly real-looking that you have to begin to wonder how many people driving around out there with an antenna on the back of their car actually have a phony,'' she said. `` Everybody is hungering for high technology across the board but because of cost prohibitions, not everybody can have them,'' she said. Some novelty store owners said they are n't so sure the phones will do as well in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, owner of Palmer Sales of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>: `` Can you see a Texan driving down the road, talking into a play phone on his way to bankruptcy court?''

 The horseradish, touted through the years for its ability to spice up everything from romance to steak, grows nowhere quite so well as in the nation's `` horseradish capital.'' Now the proud farmers just across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> who still cultivate the ugly, pungent root that their ancestors brought from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the 19th century have decided it's time to celebrate its success So they're sponsoring the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horseradish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> Saturday in <LOCATION> Collinsville </LOCATION>, complete with contests to see who can eat the most horseradishes or throw their roots the farthest. So rich is the soil, so perfect the climate, so experienced the farmers that this little section of southwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> produces about 60 percent of the nation's horseradish supply. `` It's a lot of work but it's family tradition,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, 31, a fourth generation horseradish grower. `` It's what we know how to do, and we enjoy it.'' The festival Saturday is co-sponsored by the growers and <ORGANIZATION> WRYT </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` We'll have a horseradish root-throwing contest, spoon races carrying horseradish, and a horseradish eating contest _ if we can find someone willing to participate,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheffel </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> WRYT </ORGANIZATION> radio. Centuries ago, claims were made that the white root that can grow up to a foot long would stimulate the appetite, relieve colic, rid children of worms and serve as an aphrodisiac. Now, it's more likely to be served with prime rib. Though actually a member of the mustard family, the Germans called it a sea radish _ `` meerrettich.'' Many of today's plants are from the original European root cuttings. `` It's like immortality,'' said plant geneticist <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Juvik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps the only place horseradish research is conducted. Growers say the best horseradish burns their tongues and makes their eyes water _ and they love it. `` When you smash it with your teeth, there is a chemical reaction and that makes the heat,'' said <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. `` It gets real hot.'' Most of their crop is bought by companies that grind up the roots and bottle them as traditional horseradish sauce. Besides volatile prices there are other problems for the growers. Horseradishes have to be lifted from the soil by hand and stripped of secondary roots; weeds have to be cultivated manually since herbicide companies do not want to develop chemicals for a low-volume crop; and machinery has to be built by the farmers. `` You do n't call <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and say you want to buy a horseradish picker,'' said <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, who harvests from 5,000 to 10,000 pounds per acre.

 A car careened across a playground and plowed into a crowd of children and adults about to leave an elementary school Thursday, killing a 4-year-old girl and a woman and injuring eight others, officials said. At least four of the injured were in critical condition. `` I called for 10 ambulances,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, principal at <ORGANIZATION> Cyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I told them there were bodies all over the playground.'' The motorist, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, 37, was charged late Thursday with leaving the scene of an accident and negligent driving, said Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. She was freed after posting $ 100 bail and her driver's license, he said. `` Our opinion is that she was driving too fast for conditions,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. He did n't know exactly how fast she was traveling but said Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, who suffered a bloody nose, was going over the 20 mph limit. Witnesses said the car crashed through a chain-link fence and careened across the playground before running up a short flight of stairs to where the crowd was gathered in an entryway at the school. `` I was standing outside the school picking up my son when I turned my head and saw the car coming towards the door,'' said <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 30, whose children, ages 8 and 5, attend the school. `` I just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away. The car missed us by a yard and a half.'' `` There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,'' said <PERSON> Araceli </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, whose niece lives with her and attends the school. `` Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother next to them.'' The principal said the car pinned a child and an adult beneath it. `` Myself and a couple of the teachers and a janitor picked the car up and freed the bodies so they would n't be further crushed,'' he said. The driver walked from the scene, the car still wedged in the entryway, witnesses said. Patrolman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielman </PERSON> said police picked up the woman in the neighborhood minutes after the accident. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, a student at <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, said the car belonged to his family and that his mother apparently had come to the school to pick him up. `` I got on my bus. I just saw my car, I do n't know where my mother is,'' he said. A 4-year-old girl and a woman died at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> hospitals, spokeswomen said. In critical condition in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were a 7-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, both with head injuries, and two children, ages 6 and 9, with leg fractures. A 7-year-old boy with head injuries was in fair condition. A 29-year-old parent was hit by the car and thrown into air but escaped serious injury, said <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Two children, ages 6 and 5, were taken to the hospital; one had head and neck injuries and was expected to be released, and the other had bumps and bruises and was in good condition, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The car smashed into the entrance where the kids were coming out,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cepak </PERSON>, 78, who lives nearby. Third-grade teacher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said he saw a youngster trying to calm one of the injured women. `` A child was stroking her hair and telling her everything would be all right,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of destitute migrant workers are being victimized by farmers who charge them as much as $ 400 each to prepare false immigration papers, authorities say. As many as 25,000 migrants dependent on social service agencies for food and shelter are in the state, unemployed and waiting for <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s strawberry harvest, the country's second largest after <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s, to begin about June 1. Under the nation's new immigration law, most migrants who picked crops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for at least 90 days in 1985-86 may qualify as permanent resident aliens and continue to legally enter the country to work in future years. Some farmers are preparing fraudulent documents for migrants who otherwise would not qualify under the law, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, the district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Others demand excessive fees to prepare the documents the migrants must present to federal authorities to fulfill the law's requirements, he said `` The <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is aware of unscrupulous employers ... who are finding new ways to exploit workers,'' <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> said. He emphasized, however, that the majority of strawberry growers treat pickers fairly. <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON> declined to comment on what steps his agency is taking to deal with the dishonest farmers and their allies, including printers who can prodcuce false rent receipts and other documents. The agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to file the papers. After that, employers who hire illegal migrant workers will face stiff penalties. The migrants must pay $ 185 each to apply for amnesty under the new law. Fees for physical examinations, pictures and other required documents push the cost to near $ 300. <PERSON> Strawberry </PERSON> farmer <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Krahmer </PERSON> said he has heard of growers charging as much as $ 400 additional to prepare the paperwork. Another grower, who asked not to be identified, said he's heard some farmers are charging $ 250. <PERSON> Krahmer </PERSON> estimated that as many as one-fourth of the migrants are being charged more than $ 25 to help defray the costs involved. He said he charges $ 20 to process paperwork for migrants seeking documentation at his Lloy-Dene Farms near <LOCATION> Cornelius </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strawberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he knows of no grower charging more than $ 25. `` The ones I know of charge nothing or a nominal fee,'' he said. <PERSON> Krahmer </PERSON> said labor contractors, brokers who sign up and deliver the pickers to growers, are promising the papers to attract workers. Last year, the strawberry crop was harvested early and 20 percent of the crop was left in the fields because not enough workers were in the state. Many pickers say they were told they must turn in their documentation by May 4, the deadline for aliens who are n't involved in agricultural work. Hundreds of migrant pickers, confused by the heavily publicized May deadline, are rushing to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices around the state. The result this year has been an influx of migrants, nearly all men and teen-age boys, weeks before the crop is ready to be picked. Typical of these is 14-year-old <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who is broke, on his own and a long way from his home. Speaking in Spanish, the teen-ager from <LOCATION> Ensenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said he has never picked strawberries in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> before, but that a `` friend'' told him growers would sign the papers he needs to keep returning here to work. The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zegar </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON>, said he believes contractors have drawn migrants to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> early by falsely promising to arrange their immigration papers. The workers stay in labor camps without money, food and other essentials, he said, waiting for the strawberries to ripen while social service agencies struggle to meet their needs. `` I do n't think anybody has the right to put people into a situation where they have to beg for food and essentials,'' <PERSON> Zegar </PERSON> said. At Centro Cultural, the community center in <LOCATION> Cornelius </LOCATION>, migrants watch Spanish-language television in the lobby and wait for dinner, served Monday through Thursday at 3 p.m. Each day, Centro Cultural serves an average of more than 200 free meals of beans, potatoes and tortillas to the migrants. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is meeting the needs of thousands of other migrants, distributing tons of beans, potatoes, rice and flour. The uncertainty over the workforce has led many growers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to abandon planting strawberries; plantings for next year are down 75 percent. Plantings are up in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the largest strawberry producer, which has a resident picker population and is n't reliant on foreign labor. Last year, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> produced a bumper crop of 94 million pounds which sold for a record $ 31.5 million.

 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D'Oyly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was launched on the stage, performing the comic <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> operas that made the founding company famous for 107 years. The new company opened a 10-day run Thursday at the Empire Theater in the northeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> industrial town of <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION> with a preview of `` Iolanthe,'' which drew five minutes of applause. `` The Yeomen of the Guard'' will follow next Wednesday. `` I thought it went splendidly and I hope to see us touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> before very long,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>, the company's general manager. The critics will be at tonight's gala relaunch. `` The red-hot night is Friday,'' said theater manager <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Angus </PERSON>. `` My experience teaches me that you have to have a warm-up preview to get everything right. If you go in cold, the chances always are that it will go wrong.'' Fans of librettist Sir <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and composer Sir <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the production style was a big improvement on the original company's last years, when it was condemned as `` old and tired'' by the state-funded Arts Council. The company folded in 1982 for lack of money when it was refused a subsidy. The `` Iolanthe'' plot _ ludicrous like all the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> works _ mocks the law and the unelected <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the English fancy for putting on robes, wigs, coronets and velvet knee breeches, by involving the Lord <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> and his fellow peers with the Fairy Queen and her followers. `` The pure Englishness _ not even Britishness _ of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> makes their work difficult for a foreigner like me,'' said the only American in the 103-member company, New York-born <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Emlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who sings tenor and baritone. `` Some of the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> rhymes can only be understood by English people. The operettas have been translated, though I can hardly believe it,'' he said. Canadian soprano <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, said the only problems she encountered were with the fairy wings. `` Some did n't arrive, some would n't stand straight and some fell off,'' she said. `` I felt the long history of the company was a bit of pressure on us to do well,'' Miss <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> added. The new company has an office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> but no home. <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> has offered his ornate theater, completed in 1907, as a permanent touring base. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said the two operas for the relaunch have meant an investment of about $ 1.3 million. The company was reborn on a bequest from the estate of the founder's granddaughter, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Oyly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carte </PERSON>, who died in 1985, plus commercial sponsorship and donations from supporters worldwide. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Oyly </PERSON> <PERSON> Carte </PERSON>, a Victorian impresario, started the company in 1875 to stage the operettas and built <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and Savoy Theater from the proceeds. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> collaborated on 14 works over 25 years, including `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pirates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penzance </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` The Mikado'' and `` H.M.S. Pinafore.'' Other companies, professional and amateur, perform the Savoy Operas, as the works are known. But the <ORGANIZATION> D'Oyly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carte </ORGANIZATION> company is the only one devoted entirely to them.

<TEXT>
 Instead of slowing down, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is stepping on the gas. But the determined secretary of state has little to show for his vigorous diplomatic efforts in these final months of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He had hoped to open <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks this Sunday, in the first stage of an ambitious <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program aimed at providing some measure of self-rule to the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. But despite two trips to the area, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was unable to persuade <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> or King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to accept his proposal. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says he will keep trying, and will try to find the time to make another personal appeal to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> leaders. But he seems less optimistic than ever before. On the Soviet front, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is making arrangements for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29-June 2 for a fourth and probably final summit meeting with General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The centerpiece was supposed to be a treaty to halve the Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons. But with only a month left, the two sides are still far apart on such issues as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative and how to monitor the reduction of mobile missiles and other weapons that are relatively easy to conceal. Even the treaty signed at last year's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit to scrap intermediate-range nuclear missiles is still awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will try again May 11-12 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. But he appears to be lowering his sights to a summit that would be mostly an exchange of views between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> instead of a historic event. Analysts differ on whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s decision to withdraw some 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is a victory for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy or a decision taken by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for its own reasons. But on other regional fronts there is little opportunity for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to claim credit. The Soviets are resisting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plea that they help impose a worldwide arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. And they decline to accept a benign role in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. `` I did n't achieve any breakthrough,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> admitted Thursday to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee about his talks last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Taking the long view, he reminded the senators how cool the U.S.-Soviet relationship was in 1985, before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took over. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s human rights pleas now get a respectful hearing, and even some action. Jewish emigration hit a 15-month high last month. Giving the subject `` the pride of place'' on his agenda, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> opened his talks with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> with human rights and kept at it for two hours. In the past, the Soviets mostly listened impassively to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pleas. Now American and Soviet lawyers and psychiatrists are holding meetings to discuss the situation. Otherwise, though, even the climate is worsening. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took sharp exception last week to a speech by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accusing the Soviets of aggression and other bad behavior. He complained the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` sermonizing'' as well as attributing any improvement in relations to a policy of strength. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tried to minimize the criticism. He said there was a `` rhythm'' to U.S.-Soviet relations that had both moments of progress and of discord. Other State Department officials were privately critical of the tough rhetoric in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech. They said it had not been submitted to the department for review before delivery. Ever loyal, though, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on Thursday that `` we must call it as we see it.''

<HEAD>Senate-Passed AIDS Bill Would Provide $1.1 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of a billion-dollar AIDS research and education bill shows that the government has finally `` declared war on the virus and not on the victims,'' supporters say. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 87-4 for the $ 1.1 billion bill Thursday night after agreeing unanimously to require AIDS tests on people convicted of state or federal crimes related to sex or intravenous drug use. The focus now shifts to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where a bill covering research on AIDS is committee but measures addressing other portions of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> legislation have not be introduced. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill authorizes $ 665 million for state and federal AIDS education programs, increased hiring at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a new home health care program for AIDS victims and special efforts to help high-risk minorities and intravenous drug abusers. A committee aide said open-ended research money would bring total annual spending to about $ 1.1 billion. `` Finally, we have declared war on the virus and not on the victims in our battle against AIDS,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> spearheaded support for the bill <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the national political action committee for the gay and lesbian community, said he was `` delighted'' with bill, which he said `` for the first time establishes a national policy on AIDS.'' During frequently bitter debate, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected or weakened a number of amendments proposed by conservatives, several of them by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. The most controversial was <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' attempt to renew an expiring 1987 ban on federal money for educational materials that allegedly promote or encourage homosexual activity. The ban passed 94-2 last year, but some senators said it has hampered public health efforts to reach the gay community. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' drive was fueled by a gay-oriented AIDS education videotape he viewed with several senators on Wednesday. `` I thought that I had seen everything until I saw this video,'' said the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Republican. `` There's something wrong when federal tax dollars are used for this garbage.'' But the bill's Republican co-sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, told his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleague that he ought to consider public health concerns and not just moral ones. `` We have to tell homosexuals more than simply to become heterosexuals,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment, but the victory was brief. Lawmakers also voted for a Kennedy amendment that said nothing in the bill should prevent the dissemination of accurate information to people at risk _ effectively superseding the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> provision. The debate provoked a number of outbursts. At one point Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, tried to get a quick vote on a provision but Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., would n't `` What the hell could be more important than 1.5 million people who are going to die?'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> exploded. `` I suggest we should just stick to this business and just do it or not do it and go home.'' Homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal disease spread through blood, blood products or semen. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, more than half of whom have died. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> was frustrated in several attempts to win an outright ban on federal money for programs in which drug addicts exchange shared and possibly AIDS-contaminated needles for clean ones. The final version says federal money could not be used for clean-needle programs unless the surgeon general concludes they help stop drug addiction or the spread of AIDS. A disgusted <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said `` it's just a matter of time'' before federal dollars flow toward the programs. Under the testing amendment sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., AIDS tests would be mandatory for those convicted of sex or drug crimes carrying a penalty of at least a year in prison Results would be confidential but could be disclosed to prison wardens or victims of sex crimes. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced last year it would test new immigrants and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later put its stamp of approval on the policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> tests all 2.1 million men and women on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last October that it would test some federal prisoners. Senators voting against the AIDS bill were <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION> Not voting were Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON>, D-Miss; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> Despite the bill's approval, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said it only the first step toward a national AIDS policy that also must address sensitive testing and discrimination questions. `` The total effort has to include testing, confidentiality and anti-discrimination provisions,'' he said. `` We begin work on those tomorrow.''

 In the bustling and often chaotic seafood industry, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> casts a widening net for what might be the most prized catch of all: Buyers who refuse to pay up. <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>'s work has taken him on predawn visits to ramshackle back offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tough Fulton Fish Market, where prudent debt collectors seldom venture in an industry notorious for its proliferation of deadbeats. Bullhorn in hand, <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> has brazenly entered crowded seafood restaurants at the height of the lunch hour to announce to patrons that the fish on their plates may not have been paid for. `` It's the No. 1 problem in the industry,'' says the former debt collector and sales representative for <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who has carved out a fast-growing and profitable new business, <ORGANIZATION> Debt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fish is in such demand, it's so popular, that it's not hard to sell. It's certainly not hard to sell a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lobster. The hard part is to get paid for it.'' Part of the problem is that seafood is a perishable commodity whose value is at its highest when it hits the dock and then diminishes rapidly. `` To get the most for their product before the value drops they have to move it very quickly _ and that means they take unusual risks,'' <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> explained. `` They'll sell to people knowing there's maybe only a 50-50 chance they'll get paid, as opposed to a 100 percent chance that the fish will spoil and become a non-saleable item.'' Because sellers are reluctant to communicate with each other for fear of losing a competitive edge, unscrupulous restaurateurs and wholesalers have been known to switch from supplier to supplier in order to avoid ever having to pay their accounts due, <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> says. To combat such practices, Debt Management semimonthly publishes SeaScan, a continuously updated list of hundreds of seafood markets, restaurants, wholesalers, brokers and distributors who are in arrears on their debts. The publication, about 50 pages long, consists of yellow pages with the names of buyers whose payments are at least 30 days past due; red pages listing buyers whose accounts have been referred to the company for collection; and white pages, tagged the `` rubber sheet,'' which lists buyers whose checks have bounced. `` Yellow is slow, red has stopped,'' <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> explains. `` Everyone who has stopped paying his bills slowed down first.'' SeaScan is distributed to his company's more than 200 clients, ranging from salmon harvesters in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to catfish producers in the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> to shrimp importers on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. A seller who purchases the SeaScan report and becomes a Debt Management client can refer past due accounts to <PERSON> Workman </PERSON>'s company, which receives a percentage of the overdue receivables it collects in addition to a $ 2,500 a year membership fee. The 33-year-old <LOCATION> Nyack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, native, who began the business three years ago in his home, today has 17 employees and subsidiary offices in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He says his clients are among the largest in the industry, accounting for nearly half the dollar volume of seafood sold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> has n't emerged unscathed from deadbeat raids. He recalls the time three fish cutters grabbed him by the jacket at a seafood wholesaler's in <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and tossed him unceremoniously onto the sidewalk. But while inside the establishment, <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> had spotted some boxes bearing the name of one of his major clients. He immediately telephoned the client and apprised him of the situation; the client, in turn, called the wholesaler and threatened to cut off future shipments if he did n't pay the debt. Waiting for <PERSON> Workman </PERSON> when he returned was an apology and a check for $ 15,000.

 Congressional investigators are portraying <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a greedy firm that elbowed its own clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues of high-yield, high-risk `` junk'' bonds. But <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, in 6 -LCB- hours of testimony Thursday before the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, steadfastly defended the firm's practice of permitting employees to form private partnerships to compete with other investors for bonds underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Under questioning from Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of both the committee and subcommittee, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> acknowledged `` the perception of a conflict is troublesome. Still, he said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> not only condones the partnerships, but believes they benefit corporate bond issuers by making more money available to buy the bonds. However, documents released by the subcommittee showed that on several occasions <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees purchased bonds from much-sought issues for their own accounts at the same time the firm's public customers were being turned away. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Texstyrene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, manufacturer of styrofoam products, partnerships owned by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees purchased $ 12 million of an initial $ 50 million offering in February 1986, according to the subcommittee. Public customers were allowed to buy only some of the bonds they wanted, and within 17 days <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees made more than $ 900,000 profits by selling the bonds back to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, subcommittee documents indicate. In another case, the subcommittee said, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees purchased $ 235 million of a $ 2.5 billion issue in the April 1986 leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified food and consumer products company. Again, other customers were denied the chance to purchase as many bonds as they had initially ordered. And less than three months later, the employees made a $ 2.8 million profit by selling $ 61.4 million of the bonds, the subcommittee said. `` Any way you slice it, the people on the outside are n't getting the same deal as the people on the inside,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, in effect, `` elbowed aside'' its own customers and `` cut to the head of the line. He said a telephone survey of five top competitors of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, whom he declined to identify, showed that none would permit similar practices. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said it is quite common that investors will want to buy more bonds than are available and said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> used the same criteria for deciding how many bonds employees could purchase as it did for its other customers. He said purchases by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees are closely monitored for propriety by the firm's compliance department. However, Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on committee, said the purchases for `` insider accounts'' appear to violate the regulations of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> argued that the rules applied only to sales of stock because bond prices are not subject to manipulation in the same way as are prices of new stock issues. Lent said high-quality, investment-grade bonds are exempt from the rules, but not the risky bonds of the type <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> issued. The subcommittee released a list of 35 so-called `` insider accounts'' owned by employees including <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond trading unit in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and relatives of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Also listed as having participated in the partnerships are <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a former investment banker now serving a prison term for securities law violations, and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who also has pleaded guilty to violations of securities laws. Both are former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employees and have cooperated in government probes of Wall Street corruption. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, in a subcommittee appearance Wednesday, cited his constitutional protection against self-incrimination in refusing to answer questions. He confirmed that he has been under investigation for 18 months by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal grand jury that is reported to be probing insider trading. Both <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> have denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> pioneered use of junk bonds to allow companies without a track record of earnings to get financing based on whether they had sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. The bonds pay higher interest rates than those of established companies and are considered riskier investments.

<HEAD>Senate Vote Scuttles Immigration Amnesty Extension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chief author of the nation's landmark immigration law says illegal aliens better apply for amnesty by next Wednesday's deadline, because a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote has ended any chance for an extension. `` This is it,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., said Thursday night after helping to kill a plan that would have moved the deadline to Nov. 30 `` This extraordinary act of grace will end May 4 when we are in recess.'' Those who sought to move the date back nearly seven months were defeated when they tried to end debate by opponents of the extension. Only 40 votes could be mustered to end the budding filibuster, and 60 were needed. With the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adjourning today until May 9, supporters of the extension have no chance to try to pick up another 20 votes. Even if the extension had passed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would have vetoed the bill as suggested by Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the amnesty extension April 21 by a 213-201 vote, indicating that a veto would have been sustained there. A two-thirds vote is needed for an override. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was the chief sponsor of the 1986 law passed to control years of massive illegal immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The measure had two main portions: legalization for illegal aliens who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before Jan. 1, 1982 and have lived here continually since then; and financial penalties for employers who knowingly hired illegal residents. The aliens were given a one-year period, through May 4, to apply for temporary residency and start down the longer road toward permanent residency and citizenship. About 1.3 million applications have been received so far, and the approval rate is running about 95 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> figures. Those who opposed the extension argued that supporters of the change played a cruel hoax on illegal aliens by proposing legislation that had no chance of enactment. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that people have been calling daily asking how long the extension would last. Even before the vote, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> anticipated it would be swamped as the deadline approaches. The agency has already announced that any alien who shows up before the deadline can file an application now and produce the supporting documents later. Offices will officially be open until midnight Wednesday, and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said anyone in line will be permitted to file an application. Applicants have to pay a fee of $ 185 for individuals and $ 420 for a family. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said illegal aliens who fail to beat the deadline will `` lose the opportunity to get the best gift <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has _ to be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> legally.'' `` After an initial period when the law was taken seriously, the level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last year,'' he said. `` When people are asked why they are coming, they say they do n't believe the law is going to be enforced.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> added that the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> is finding a large increase in the use of false documents by illegal aliens. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who argued for the extension, predicted that hundreds of thousands of eligible aliens would not apply by next Wednesday `` There has been a cloud of confusion encircling this program since its inception,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` The regulations defining who is eligible for legalization were finalized days before the application period opened. `` INS' public education campaign got off to a slow start and has been ineffective in convincing the undocumented in certain communities _ such as the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> community in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ to come forward,'' he said. But <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and others said the original bill was carefully balanced between the amnesty and employer sanctions programs, and should not be unraveled now.

 Alarmed by the growing number of latchkey children thrust upon them, the nation's public librarians are shelving their normally quiet roles and clamoring for better day care and after-school programs. `` Librarians have to become political animals,'' says <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Early Adolescence. `` We've got to take care of our kids.'' Their pleas, along with proposed solutions, are being presented in a 50-page policy paper today at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s national conference `` We're really the voice of the children,'' said <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefansson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The public library's image as a safe, friendly, educational and cost-free haven, has made it hardest hit by the growing number of latchkey children. Like many children's librarians, Ms. <PERSON> Stefansson </PERSON> regularly finds herself serving as policeman, caretaker, referee and nurse. Forty to 60 children as young as first-graders descend upon her every weekday afternoon, many of them instructed to do so by their working parents. `` The parents think their children are really reading, and that's the biggest myth,'' she said Thursday during the four-day conference, which ends Saturday. The youngsters keep pouring in, despite Ms. <PERSON> Stefansson </PERSON>'s successful work with community groups to offer better after-school care She's even developed a network of babysitters for working parents. `` I do n't want to be a surrogate parent,'' she said. Noise is up and graffiti is commonplace at many libraries, say leaders of the 6,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Skateboards whiz through reference rooms, bicycles clutter the halls, flowers are trampled and parking lots are pickup and dropoff stations. `` It's hard for the library to close when the parents do n't get there in time to pick up their kids,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we're concerned about are those -LRB- children -RRB- who ca n't leave, who are not happy being there,'' agreed <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dauphin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Library System in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` We can only go so far in trying to provide a good program, a good attitude, the right helping hand, the smile. By no means are librarians yearning for quiet, empty space. `` Having lots of kids in a library is something a librarian loves. They encourage it. That's what we're there for,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` We're looking at the issue on the broader basis. Can or should public libraries be day-care centers?'' The group's policy paper, six months in the making, urges librarians to ask community leaders and agencies to develop more after-school programs. It will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee in May, then go before the board of directors in July for final approval. While not confined to libraries, the situation `` is symptomatic of a bigger problem'' involving child neglect and sometimes even abuse, said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, director of child care for the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> During the early 1970s, some 30 percent of children under age 6 had a mother who worked outside the home, Ms. <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said. Current estimates put that figure at 54 percent, and the number is increasing. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, primary author of the <ORGANIZATION> PLA </ORGANIZATION>'s policy paper, worries that latchkey children may grow up to become adults `` who never want to see another library. In the meantime, she says, they're missing out on quality time with family or skilled child care supervisors. `` It's not a question of who's supposed to take care of the kids,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said. `` It's a question of lost opportunity.''

 Citizen <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> had his `` Rosebud,'' the vanished childhood possession that symbolized his yearnings, and <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> publishing empire chieftain <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> had his `` bunny blanket.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> on Thursday revealed the origin of the bunny emblem that graces the Playboy magazine cover as he introduced the newest `` Playmate of the Year,'' 22-year-old <PERSON> India </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, featured in the magazine's December 1987 centerfold, received a $ 60,000 sports car and a check for $ 100,000 as Playmate of the Year When he was `` a little kid'' one of his treasures was a blanket `` with bunnies all over it,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said. `` It was what <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in ` Peanuts' calls a security blanket,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said. `` I called it my ` bunny blanket.'''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who resigned as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' top aide after embarrassing his boss with an `` attack video'' aimed at a rival candidate, is still in contact with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner, and some predict he would have a top job in a Dukakis White House. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and I are good friends, and, as he has said, we still talk from time to time, discuss things,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said in a brief telephone conversation this week. `` But I have no active role with the campaign.'' He would n't say what he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> discuss, except that their talks include campaign-related issues. He said the two have not discussed potential running mates for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner. Aides say <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> is in weekly contact with the candidate. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, however, has no formal role in the campaign. `` This is the way it has to be,'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> said. Now working at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> advertising and public relations firm, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> declined further comment, saying he is not granting interviews about the campaign. He resigned his job as manager of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign after admitting he gave reporters a videotape that showed Democratic rival <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> giving a speech patterned on one by British politician <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, without giving <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> credit. That _ along with revelations that <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> had exaggerated his academic record _ eventually drove the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> senator to drop out of the race. The incident caused a furor, and became an issue in the primary campaign. Former Democratic candidate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, in a last-ditch drive before the Super Tuesday contacts, put an ad on the air that said, in part, `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smeared <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> ... and now he's attempting to smear <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is known for his caution and aides say there has been no discussion of bringing <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> back into the campaign. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were the Democratic nominee running against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s presence in the campaign could hamper any <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> effort to bring up the so-called `` sleaze factor'' _ the long list of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials accused of wrongdoing. But some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say privately that they would not be surprised to see <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> back at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side if he won the November election, perhaps as White House chief of staff. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> have a long history together, and <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> has helped see <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> through some dark days. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> return from political exile four years after he was voted out of the governor's office in 1978. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> a few days after that 1978 loss, keeping a promise he had made to assist a referendum drive that <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> managed. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, impressed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had kept his word despite the crushing defeat, offered to help <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he ever ran for office again. He managed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign and became <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief aide at the statehouse, where he was credited with helping the governor mend fences with legislators and interest groups alienated in his first term. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, who took a leave from his statehouse post to manage <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1984 vice presidential campaign, was among the first to urge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to run for president. He brought in veterans from <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s staff and that of former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> when he assembled the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. The `` attack video'' incident was particularly embarrassing because it came at a time when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was urging rivals in the then-crowded <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> field to wage positive campaigns. To compound the problem, <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> acknowledged his role in the episide only after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said publicly he did not believe his campaign was responsible for distributing the tapes. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared indecisive after <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s admission, at first saying he did not want to fire him. Finally, though, he acknowledged that `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> has to go.'' <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s assistant, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, was promoted to campaign manager. <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> in 1984 and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also consults periodically with her friend and former boss. `` I chat with him occassionally about how things are going,'' <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> said. `` But I think <PERSON> John </PERSON> realizes that the strength of this campaign is the candidate.''

 A dispatcher in charge of two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and Northwestern freight trains that collided March 21 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> had been drinking too much and automatic brakes on one train had been shut off, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also said two brakemen had tested positive for marijuana use. Three crewmen were seriously injured in the accident, which caused $ 195,000 in damage. The accident occurred in <LOCATION> Dixon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, when a train consisting of a locomotive and a single car headed east while a train of four locomotives and 130 cars headed west on the same track, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said. The smaller, eastbound train was equipped with what is known as `` automatic train control,'' which should have stopped it when the two entered the same signal block, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the engineer had deliberately disabled the device. The dispatcher had a blood alcohol level of 0.15 percent, while the standard for intoxication in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is 0.10 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said. A brakeman on the eastbound train and one on the westbound train each tested positive for marijuana, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Strong wind and rising tides hampered the cleanup of a 175,000-gallon oil spill and posed a new threat to a fragile bird sanctuary where nearly 200 oil-soaked birds and animals have died. `` The good news is the oil is no longer getting out of <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON>, where 80 percent of it was trapped, but the bad news is that what's out there in the strait and bays is going to get swirled around a bit by nature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Zawadzki </PERSON> said Thursday. Meanwhile, a state water quality engineer speculated the size of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s spill may be even larger than the 175,000 gallons estimated by the company. The spill occurred Saturday when a drainpipe that carries off rainwater broke inside an oil tank, allowing oil to be siphoned out. So far workers have recovered some 126,000 gallons of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> crude, a particularly thick oil, from the area 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Because much of the oil remains in <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> and nearby marshes, <PERSON> Kazemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossain </PERSON>, an engineer with the state <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> board, told reporters he expects <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> `` will revise upwards their spill estimate, after we do our own calculations.'' Earlier Thursday, westerly winds up to 25 mph and increasingly higher tides pushed up to 1,600 gallons of oil out of remote sloughs into the <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and into still more waterfowl nesting areas. Similar gusts were expected today, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecasters said. By the weekend, easterly winds and exceptionally high weekend tides _ peaking about 5 feet _ are likely to send still more oil into uncontaminated areas, <PERSON> Zawadzki </PERSON> said. Eight skimmer boats on Thursday began removing new oil-sheen patches stretching six miles from <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON>, where 400 boats were trapped in the oily harbor, to <LOCATION> Ryer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the the oil got into nesting areas. Some 450 oily waterfowl and animals have been recovered. Of those, 192 have died or were dead when discovered, according to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, regional manager of the state Fish and Game Department. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> advised sport fishing and recreational boats owners to stay out of <LOCATION> Suisun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> over the weekend, where several oil sheens were spotted. The bay is about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Boat skippers, many of whom make a living by taking out weekend parties of sports fishermen, were upset they would not be allowed out to sea Sunday for the opening of the salmon season. They also could not leave the marina for the <LOCATION> Sacramento-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION>, where steelhead trout are approaching the peak of their spawning season. `` This is going to be a big blow to a lot of old timers around here because they count on getting out to sea and getting a good catch early in the season when they can get the best price,'' said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torliano </PERSON>, 74, whose son operates a family fishing business.

<HEAD>Railroad Car Shortage Hampers Grain Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Robust export demand and failure to add to the fleet since 1982 have caused a shortage of railroad cars to move wheat and corn, says a transportation official with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Although the car shortages appear to have eased in recent days, steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch that occurred earlier this year, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> also defended <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> export policies and programs which have helped trigger a rebound in farm commodity exports. A study released by <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> showed a severe disruption of grain shipments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year through mid-April because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads. The study was requested by Reps. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Neb <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said he planned to cite the study further at a hearing on Monday, May 2, in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said the actual number of cars available for grain movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last significant number was added to the railroad fleet. Also, there has been a large surge in export wheat sales under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, during the past few months. Big sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in particular, have added to the railroad grain traffic. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, exporters can sell wheat or other designated commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and then collect subsidies from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in the form of government-owned surplus grain or other agricultural products. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said car shortages meant some local elevators were unable to take delivery of grain from farmers, grain merchants had difficulty completing sales, and railroads hiked rates and restricted use of cars in certain markets. Also, he said, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` received limited response'' to its weekly auctions of surplus wheat because of the car shortages. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> was asked by a reporter whether the rail car shortages had interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the extent that ships were kept waiting for grain to load. `` We do not believe that to be the case, as a general rule,'' he said. But there may have been `` some specific circumstances'' what that happened in the last six months. `` It's not a trend, it is not a significant problem down the road,'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. Although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has improved the last 10 days, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> noted that export demand has slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased. Also, he said, railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies, and many of those now are being reconciled. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said that it will take pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, farm groups, the grain trade and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to settle the rail car situation. Ideally, he said, shippers and the railroads should sit down under auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and resolve the problems. The <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION>, he said, has the authority to force a settlement. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> was asked if he thought the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> was dragging its feet. `` All I would say to you is the <ORGANIZATION> ICC </ORGANIZATION> has full authority to resolve this issue,'' he said. `` It's been almost six years that they have had it on their table, so you draw your own conclusion.''

 Farm policy could be improved worldwide by making government support to farmers independent of acreage and production levels, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and Agricultural Policy. This policy of decoupling would lead to `` more efficient production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when compared to current farm policies,'' the center reported Thursday. Some form of decoupling for American farmers has been advocated unsuccessfully in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a number of years. One example would be to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits without tying them to specific acreage or production levels. As defined by the center _ a part of the independent, non-profit Washington-based think tank, Resources for the Future _ decoupling would mean `` providing government support to farmers in ways that do not distort production, prices, consumption, resource allocation or trade.'' Decoupling does n't set well with some farm groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, for example, says it is tantamount to putting farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for price supports. A statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> NFU </ORGANIZATION> at its recent annual convention said: `` Farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost of producing food. These payments are actually subsidies to consumers that pass through the hands of farmers.''

 Two ballets with music composed by Pulitzer Prize-winners for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>'s American Music Festival were premiered this week at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Theater. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuorinen </PERSON>, who won the Pulitzer for music in 1970, conducted Thursday night's premiere of his `` Five,'' written for cello and orchestra. Cello soloist <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON>'s part was often spiky, without obvious melody or beat, but always listenable. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnefoux </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> from 1970 to'80 and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s dance department since 1985, choreographed in neo-classic style. He has his men in gray and women in silver-gray and he moves them in diagonal patterns and wedge shapes. When <PERSON> Jock </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> lifted <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Calegari </PERSON>, she seemed to float. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Byars </PERSON> and <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> Woetzel </PERSON> had some high jumping and several times danced with seven women around them. Wednesday night saw the premiere of `` Tanzspiel'' by <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taaffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwilich </PERSON>, who won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1983. The company's co-ballet master in chief <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> choreographed. This plotless dance lacked that inner pulse that makes one movement seem to follow another logically. `` Tanzspiel'' had some lovely romantic dancing for <PERSON> Kyra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> proved again that he knows how to fill a stage with dancers. But `` Tanzspiel'' does n't flow. The music is ominous much of the time and <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> often has grim movements in dim light. There were exits where applause obviously was expected but there was n't any. Also Wednesday, the company beautifully danced `` Glass Pieces'' choreographed by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> to <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>. `` Glass Pieces'' makes a better impression with each viewing. Miss <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> danced with superlative virtuosity in `` Stars and Stripes,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s choreography to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON>. Thursday's program began with `` Jubilee!'' danced by fresh, proficient students at the School of American Ballet. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duell </PERSON>'s choreography to <PERSON> Hershy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>'s music was charming but repetitious; he should have used less of the music. `` Calcium Light Night'' is a series of dazzling modern solos choreographed by <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> in 1977 to music by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON>. <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> were the impressive performers.

<HEAD>State Can't Pay Mecham Impeachment Expenses Without New Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s attorney general said Thursday that the state can not pay former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s $ 200,000 legal bill from his impeachment trial without a new law authorizing such action. Legislators said Thursday they almost certainly will not pass such a law. A spokeswoman in <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s office said the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor would not comment on the non-binding opinion issued by Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, also a Republican, until <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his lawyers had a chance to review it. Two days after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s removal April 4 in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 16-13 to pay $ 202,433 to his attorneys, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. At the time, supporters said it was a `` healing'' gesture. But state Treasurer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottas </PERSON> balked at writing the check and asked <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> for an opinion on whether the payment was permitted. `` There is no authority to pay <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s costs and attorneys' fees,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> concluded. However, he told reporters that the state could pay <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s expenses if a new law were passed to authorize it. `` We are not going to pass, in my estimation, anything in either house,'' said GOP Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>. House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, also a Republican, said House Republicans were not enthusiastic about paying either the legal fees or <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s recall expenses. The former governor has asked the state to pay him $ 231,000 for his campaign costs before a May 17 recall vote aimed at his removal was canceled. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and misusing $ 80,000 by loaning it to his auto dealership. He faces a criminal trial May 19 on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appeared headed for a fight over arms control restrictions opposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the two Democratic-controlled chambers work on versions of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to ban all but the smallest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear tests, the third restriction approved in two days as the chamber works on its version of a defense bill. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which finished work Thursday on its version, includes only one restriction that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does n't want. That would ban any Star Wars tests that violate the narrow interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. That limit was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, along with the restriction on most nuclear tests, and a prohibition against any nuclear weapons that violate the numerical limits in the unratified SALT II nuclear arms treaty. Neither of the last two is in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure. When the two bills are passed separately by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, they will be sent to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee to reconcile differences. `` In some ways, we're more liberal than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, or at least the liberals are more powerful here,'' explained Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Both bills authorize <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending of $ 299.5 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. That was the total set last December in the `` budget summit'' between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to reduce the federal budget deficit. The total was $ 33 billion less than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had originally thought it would receive in the next fiscal year. To meet the lower figure, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> ordered cuts in manpower, along with the early retirement of 16 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigates. `` He took some tough decisions and made hard choices and we supported him in our budget,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> agreed. `` <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> made a lot of tough choices and that's why the Pentagon fared pretty well in our committee We did n't cut much.'' On Thursday, the House:

<TEXT>
 _ Voted 214-186 to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons larger than one kiloton The decision came after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed, 399-0, a Republican-backed amendment praising <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to negotiate limits on testing. A similar ban was also approved a year ago by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but was dropped by the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> and ended up as only an advisory request. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said `` we owe it to our children'' to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests But Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, R-Mich., said the restriction would `` totally undercut our negotiators. He referred to ongoing U.S.-Soviet talks. _ Voted down, 205-197, an anti-satellite -LRB- ASAT -RRB- ban which was proposed for a fourth year But the panel also turned down, 212-195, a proposal to spend $ 100 million for development of a ground-based anti-satellite weapon. The ASAT limit had been imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the past three years and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> responded by dropping work on the program to develop an ASAT weapon fired from a high-flying F-15 jet. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is now working on different types of ASATs, particularly those using ground-based lasers. Another difference between the two bills is over how much to authorize for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, as Star Wars is formally known. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel recommended $ 4.6 billion for SDI. The House bill provides $ 4.0 billion, although that figure may change when the issue is debated next week on the floor. Currently, SDI receives $ 3.9 billion and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought $ 4.8 billion for the next fiscal year.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official denies he tried to taint the Iran-Contra investigation by pressing congressional testimony about the shredding of sensitive documents on an investigator for independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. In a letter to <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said Thursday his `` fleeting reference'' to the immunized congressional testimony of fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in front of one of <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigators was `` wholly inadvertent.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> did not identify the testimony, but <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources say it concerns <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements that he shredded sensitive documents in the presence of <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> and another aide to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has publicly denied that portion of North's testimony. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the mention of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s testimony was prompted by a question from the investigator, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hetherton </PERSON>, an associate counsel on the independent counsel's staff. In testimony that <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> wrote he was `` startled to read,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in federal court Wednesday at the pre-trial taint hearing in the Iran-Contra scandal that <PERSON> Hetherton </PERSON> had to use `` forceful'' language to cut off <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> as he started to relate some of North's testimony. `` She really had to be energetic to get him to stop,'' testified <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> flatly rejected <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s characterization. The exchange with <PERSON> Hetherton </PERSON> took a minute or two in normal conversational tones and `` neither of us interrupted ... neither her language nor mine ever approached being ` forceful' or even remotely impolite,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said in the letter. `` The fact is that my fleeting reference to something that came up'' during <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony last summer was in response to a question by <PERSON> Hetherton </PERSON> just before <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' subsequent grand jury appearance, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> wrote `` As soon as I answered, she advised me that I should not discuss with her or the grand jury any immunized congressional testimony and I instantly apologized, assuring her that my reference had been wholly inadvertent,'' said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, the counselor to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. By law, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> must convince the judge in the case that the indictments of North and three others was obtained independently of immunized congressional testimony. North and two of the defendants in the case are trying to use their immunity grants as a way of getting the indictments dismissed. North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner, are under indictment for conspiracy, theft and fraud charges. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, had no comment on <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' letter. North testified that he shredded sensitive documents while <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and another <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aide, then-chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, were in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office reviewing his files during a weekend inquiry in November 1986. The inquiry led to the uncovering of the diversion to the Contras of money from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North's testimony raised the suggestion of incompetence by the attorney general's staff or of a possible cover-up to which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s staff acquiesced.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Accuses Quaker Oats of Misleading Health Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group contends that <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> advertisements overstate the benefit of the company's cereal products in reducing the risk of heart attacks. The Center for Science in the Public Interest filed a complaint Thursday seeking a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> order to halt a magazine advertising campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> and Oat Bran. A <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company has ample evidence to support its claim that eating oat cereal helps reduce cholesterol, a major cause of heart disease. `` Scientific research documents the effect that oats can have,'' spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottrell </PERSON> said. `` We're confident with the claims that have been made.'' The ads, which feature actor <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> <PERSON> Brimley </PERSON>, recommend lowering fat intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet. The center objected to one section saying that clinical studies show serum-cholesterol dropped an average of nearly 10 percent among people who ate <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> daily as part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. `` Quaker is grossly exaggerating,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, legal director for the non-profit advocacy group. `` The Brimley ads make the reader believe that <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> are some type of magic wand. `` In fact, most of the improvement in the health of individuals who eat <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> was due to also eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.'' He said oat cereal, by itself, accounted for only a 3 percent cholesterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in the risk of heart disease, `` a modest to minimal improvement ... of borderline significance.'' A heart-disease specialist at the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he had not seen the ads and did not want to take sides. `` Nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that amount,'' Dr. Basil <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, if you look at it in population terms, we usually say that even small reductions in cholesterol could be meaningful.'' Commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the complaint.

<HEAD>Red Cross Survey Finds Potential New Threat In Donated Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is `` right on target'' with plans to start testing donated blood for a rare virus linked to a vicious form of adult leukemia, says the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> researcher who first discovered the virus. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, a scientist credited with discovering the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, or HTLV-1, said the nation's blood supply should be tested to protect future generations from the slow-acting but dangerous virus In a Science magazine report published today, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> scientist recommended that blood donated across the country should be tested for the HTLV-1 virus as soon as a practical test be developed. The recommendation was made after a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> survey found 10 units infected with the virus out of 39,898 units tested. `` I think there are as many people infected with this virus as are infected with the AIDS virus,'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said his research team estimates that the risk of becoming infected with the HTLV-1 leukemia virus is about 2,800 in 12 million, or about 1 chance in 4,286 for every unit of blood transfused annually. `` The danger is minimal but not insignificant,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. For that reason, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> `` wants to take an active stance to keep the situation from getting worse, as it possibly could.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said current methods of testing donated blood for the virus take up to three days and a more practical test must be developed before HTLV-1 screening can begin. He said at least three drug companies, which he declined to name, are trying to develop screening tests, but these are months from possible approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> researcher discovered and identified the HTLV-1 virus in 1978. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said his understanding of HTLV-1, a retrovirus that takes over genetic control of cells it attacks, led him to look for a retrovirus as the cause of AIDS. He is credited as co-discoverer of the HIV virus that causes AIDS. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said HTLV-1 may be rare in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it is endemic in parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Orient. `` In time, due to increased travel and increased sexual contact, these kinds of virus are all increasing -LRB- in the continental <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>. Because HTLV-1 has a long latent period before it causes disease, he said, `` it is not as readily seen as AIDS, but our children and our children's children will see it if we do n't start eliminating it from the blood supply.'' <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> added, `` I'm very glad to see the way the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has responded.'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> researcher who has studied the HTLV-1 virus extensively, said it is linked to adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, a type of blood cancer usually fatal within six months. Another disease closely linked to the virus, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, is tropical spastic paraparesis, in which the virus attacks nerve cells that control the lower extremities and causes paralysis and eventually death. The incubation period for expression of the leukemia is thought to be 30 years or more, but people exposed to the virus become infectious within two weeks to six months, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. Incubation for paraparesis is slightly shorter. The virus can be spread in ways similar to the AIDS virus: by sexual contact or the exchange of body fluids such as by sharing drug needles. HTLV-1 also is thought to be spread through mother's milk, said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> survey checked for HTLV-1 in samples from eight different blood banks. Blood donors who tested positive for the virus were found in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Blood also was tested in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, but no HTLV-1 was found. Though the positive tests totaled only 10 out of more than 39,000 samples tested, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` a highly selective group'' was used. `` They go through several levels -LRB- of screening -RRB- before the blood is ever drawn,'' he said.

 The setting matched the subject as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> honored the beautification efforts of Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, awarding the former first lady a congressional gold medal at a glittering White House ceremony. Under chandeliers that cast prisms of light across the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for `` an impressive career in her own right.'' `` Her concern for the poor and underprivileged helped inspire a nation; her efforts to beautify <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> continuing up to today still blossom in our nation's capital and beside our highways,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said that 20 years ago, when her husband, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, decided not to seek re-election and the family left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, she never imagined she would be back in the capital under such circumstances. It was, she said, the furthest thought from her mind. But Thursday, the wealthy, the powerful and the famous turned out in force to honor the 75-year-old Texan for filling the capital's traffic circles with tulips and lining ribbons of concrete highway with evening primroses, Indian paintbrushes and other native wildflowers. `` For all of us here at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, welcome back, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, it's good to have you home,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. In the audience were executives and politicians and men who once were members of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s inner circle. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> paid tribute and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overflowed with well-wishers as both presented Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> with resolutions honoring her good works. Speeches recalled her lifelong love of nature and her ability to inspire the rest of the nation to treasure its natural heritage. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has painted the landscape with daffodils, tulips and wildflowers; but she has also beautified <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the magic of her presence, the gentleness of her touch and her compassion for our people,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a fellow Texan and Democrat. Surrounded by her daughters, their husbands and children, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> blew kisses from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gallery after passage of the resolution honoring her. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had a few thanks herself _ for the president for taking time out of a busy schedule, and for the country. The honor, she said, was a great day for her, but also `` a salute to all those people all over this great land who are working to preserve and to enhance the natural beauty of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 The executor for <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate said he authorized the marketing of a ceramic decanter in the late entertainer's image and a dog calendar to capitalize on <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s name after his death `` Since Mr. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> loved dogs I thought it would be a good idea for his fans to have a dog calendar. So we made a deal,'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> testified Thursday in a civil lawsuit filed by five <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> associates seeking to remove <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> as executor of an estate valued as high as $ 20 million. Strote, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> lawyer, said he agreed to market the items so that more money could be made for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts, which provides scholarships for students at 22 colleges. In addition, <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said that in February 1987 he conceived the idea of an auction of Liberace memorabilia. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> died Feb. 5, 1987, of complications from AIDS. `` I wanted to strike while the iron was hot,'' he said. `` If I could help make this auction a fabulous event, the foundation would gain worldwide attention.'' The auction in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this month grossed slightly over $ 2 million and featured furnishings and memorabilia from Liberace homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Trump Tower, <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. The state civil suit was filed by the entertainer's sister, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, his manager for 37 years, housekeepers <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s companion for seven years. The five charge that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> drew up a will and trust agreements with <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, then had him sign them 13 days before his death. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was well enough to know what he was doing, but the entertainer's former nurse disputed that contention in testimony Wednesday. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said Tuesday that his firm had been paid about $ 400,000 from the estate in a 13-month period, and that he would be paid his normal retainer while involved in the current case. The attorney for the plaintiffs, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON>, complained Thursday that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>'s attorneys were dragging out the current hearing while <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> was being paid $ 250 an hour as a witness.

 A 20-year-old drug available without prescription in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> puts up a strong fight against the AIDS virus in laboratory tests, but a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> researcher says the finding `` is not a breakthrough.'' The drug, called dextran sulfate, was found to prevent the AIDS virus from infecting and killing the body's T-cell lymphocytes, the main target of the virus, researchers say in a Science article published today. But Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION>, one of the co-authors of the research paper, said in an interview that much still remains to be learned about the drug before it could possibly be used to treat AIDS. `` This is not a breakthrough,'' said <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>. He said that though the drug `` is a potent agent'' against the AIDS virus in a test tube, it is not clear that the drug can be given to patients in strong enough doses to affect the course of the disease. `` We found in the test tube that this agent is a very a powerful inhibitor of the HIV virus,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong-Staal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> researcher and co-author of a study on dextran sulfate. HIV, for human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Dr. <PERSON> Wong-Staal </PERSON> said the drug has been used for more than two decades in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere as an anticoagulant and has demonstrated that it has no significant toxicity. <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> said dextran sulfate is only one of a large family of potential anti-virals that must first undergo carefully controlled trials. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> researcher and co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, said dextran sulfate should be studied further. `` I'm impressed by the results I've seen in vitro and it merits trials -LRB- in patients -RRB-,'' he said. `` The question is will it be able to be taken by patients for long periods of time.'' A spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> NCI </ORGANIZATION> said dextran sulfate now is in clinical trials at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and results from the tests are expected to be announced at an international AIDS meeting in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in June. Dr. <PERSON> Wong-Staal </PERSON> said the drug prevents the HIV virus from invading the T-cell lymphocytes, a type of immunity cell that the AIDS virus normally attacks. Usually the HIV virus attacks the T-cells by first attaching to a receptor, a type of protein, on the cell's outer layer or envelope. In the test tube studies, dextran sulfate was found effective in preventing the virus from binding to the cell envelope, thus preventing it from invading and killing the cell. Untreated, HIV will change the genetic pattern of the T-cell and force it to start making copies of the virus. But this can not take place if the virus can not invade the cell. The drug was first formulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Uneo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It was used for decades to treat blood clots, but has not been approved for that use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The drug can be purchased routinely over the counter in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, however. Last May, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved the drug for use in limited clinical trials in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Uneo </PERSON> now holds a patent for its use against AIDS. AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. The chief victims of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since June 1981, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<TEXT>
 A ban on plastic handguns that could slip past metal detectors and X-rays will stop a major security problem before it starts, says the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that cleared such a gun-control measure. `` Plastic firearms can not be detected at security checkpoints when subject to inspection by metal detectors and they do not generate a distinct X-ray image,'' Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said. `` Consequently, plastic firearms offer the potential terrorist a window of opportunity and pose a serious threat to the public safety of all Americans.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Rodino </PERSON>'s committee approved, by voice vote, legislation sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to ban the manufacture, sale or possession of undetectable plastic firearms. The approval came after the panel defeated 23-12 an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa., that would have led to the death penalty for anyone using a so-called `` plastic gun'' in the commission of a crime Law enforcement agencies and gun control groups have been lobbying intensely for standards that would prevent terrorists from concealing plastic guns and slipping them past detectors. No plastic gun has been manufactured, but a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company has a patent on one that it has said it will manufacture for law enforcement agencies in about two years. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of the Judiciary crime subcommittee, said the legislation will not affect existing firearms but takes aim at a new generation of plastic firearms experts believe will be developed and perfected in the near future. `` This legislation is a fair and reasonable attempt to head off a serious law enforcement problem before it happens,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` It's apparent that plastic guns would become the weapons of choice for terrorists and other criminals if they became available.'' Under the bill, guns must contain at least 3.7 ounces of electronically detectable metal to make sure they can be picked up by magnetometer devices. It also requires that firearm components generate accurate X-ray images to assist in their detection. The bill makes it a federal offense to knowingly manufacture, import, sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm. It sets fines of up to $ 250,000 for individuals and $ 1 million for organizations, and up to five years in jail. The legislation is similar to one agreed to by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, law enforcement groups and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> which has opposed any changes in the law. That measure is expected to see quick passage in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaaren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> federal liaison, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary action, saying, `` We think it is the best piece of legislation introduced to date in either the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side.''

<TEXT>
 Last fall's deficit-reduction agreement was supposed to make this an easy year for passing a budget, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have managed to get in an argument anyway. Talks between the chambers on a compromise $ 1.1 trillion spending plan collapsed Thursday amid angry accusations of bad-faith negotiating. `` That which I fear the worst has befallen me,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who is retiring after this year, citing `` burnout'' from his three terms <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> blasted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators for sending an offer on the fiscal 1989 spending plan not `` in the spirit of what we sent you.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in colorful words usually impolite in public meetings, it should not expect a response and should come back with a new proposal. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., the House budget chairman, took offense `` I'm not going to sit here and be told, ` If you do n't like what we offered, then lump it,''' he said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> offered to negotiate through the weekend, but <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said he was heading back to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for next week, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is on recess. `` When the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> makes an offer that moves as far to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, send it to me by wire and I'll come back,'' he told <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Another meeting was set for May 9 but <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> warned: `` We'd better get on our seersucker suits and turn on the air conditioning I think we're going into summer.'' Last fall's deficit-reduction pact between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders laid down the outlines for the budget for the spending year beginning next Oct. 1. It settled what is usually the biggest fight _ `` guns versus butter'' _ by providing specific figures for overall military, foreign aid and domestic spending. The budgets approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, took slightly different approaches toward the domestic budget. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, approved a bigger increase in the space program, which is well-represented in his home state. The House has refused to go along, favoring more spending on housing and poverty programs. Another issue is a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan to alter the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreement to add more drug-fighting money. House members oppose breaking the summit pact for drugs alone, and not aid for the homeless and other needs. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` nitpicking'' was threatening to `` make an absolute joke out of this process.'' `` We were supposed to have a year where the -LRB- budget -RRB- summit made it easy,'' he said. Now, he said, `` we're about to destroy it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must compromise on the budget before it becomes the official guide for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' annual spending bills. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> missed its April 15 deadline for completing the budget resolution. If one is n't approved by the middle of next month the two chambers will begin passing their spending bills without one. Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., a budget committee member, urged that heads remain cool and emphasized that differences were not great `` All we've got to do is agree to have an easy time'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A newly updated hymnal for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> has won preliminary approval at the church's governing general conference _ except for some missing masculine pronouns about God. The objections arose over phrases in the accompanying psalter of psalms, not the hymns themselves. Noting that in many cases masculine personal pronouns, such as `` he'' and `` him'' had been replaced by `` God'' or `` God's,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> Case of <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, said: `` The truth is that this proposed psalter has no pronouns for God. It is a depersonalized God. And the feeling in the trenches will be that the Bible has been changed.'' <PERSON> Harriett </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, countered that `` removing pronouns is not depersonalizing God. It's calling God by God's name. The issue arose in a hearing Thursday of a legislative committee. It voted to asked the conference to restore masculine pronouns in 34 psalms in a lengthy section of them. The proposed hymnbook generally got the committee's solid backing, including the hymns and accompanying prayers, readings and rituals for communion, baptism, marriage and other observance. The conference, the top governing body of about 10 million members, is concentrating in its early stages on committee hearings, with most proposed legislation to hit the floor next week. Action on the hymnbook may come as early as Saturday by the 996 delegates, half clergy and half laity. The delegates represent the country's second largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, next to Southern Baptists. The committee recommended replacing only one of the 624 proposed hymns, asking that `` Lord of the Dance'' be substituted for `` Awake O Sleeper.'' Work on the new hymnbook, revising a 1966 edition, has gone on for four years and involved Methodists around the country. Grassroots reaction sometimes toppled committee decisions. The new book preserves 329 hymns from the old book, and includes 295 new ones. The lyrics, while using inclusive sexual terms for people, retains customary masculine pronouns for God. But the section of psalms in some cases did n't do so, which provoked the call for restoration. For instance, as in Psalm 46:6, the committee did n't like the proposed phrase, `` God's voice resounds,'' in place of the usage in the new Revised Standard Version of the Bible, `` He utters his voice.'' Masculine descriptions of God also is an issue in other matters before the conference, including proposals to allow substitution of `` Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer'' for the traditional usage, `` Father, Son and Holy Spirit.'' The conference has scheduled action Monday on controversial proposals to eliminate stands terming homosexual practice `` incompatible with Christian teaching'' and banning active homosexuals from the ministry. Criticizing the focus on homosexuality, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Carribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There is no talk about heterosexual sins. Why? Is there nothing else going on in the church.''

<HEAD>States Get Low Grades in Handling of Complaints Against Lawyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who complain about their lawyers are out of luck in most states if they expect help from the agency that is supposed to regulate the profession, a legal reform group says. A `` report card'' issued Thursday by HALT, a consumer advocacy organization campaigning to reform the attorney discipline process, gave most states surveyed an `` F'' in policing lawyers. `` Nobody is doing a good job _ the question is how bad,'' <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostberg </PERSON>, HALT's director of research and education, said at news conference. But the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which says it also is working for reforms, insists there have been improvements in recent years. `` I would say that most of the states are doing a reasonably good job given the resources they have,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McPike </PERSON>, who handles matters involving professional standards. HALT says disciplinary agencies often have a conflict of interest because they are run by lawyers and because the disciplinary process itself is mired in secrecy. In many states, the public never learns which lawyers are being investigated or the outcome of the probe. The most common complaints are of excessive legal fees or an attorney's neglect. Ms. <PERSON> Ostberg </PERSON> said disciplinary agencies do n't usually act unless the offense is shown to be excessive She cited a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> survey of 40 states which found that 54,605 complaints were received but only 1,146 or 2 percent resulted in any form of public discipline. Ninety-five percent were dismissed without any discipline. <PERSON> McPike </PERSON> says those numbers reflect that many complaints are not serious enough to warrant action. `` Ninety percent of the complaints do n't even make it past the first screening. People complain because their lawyer did n't answer their phone call fast enough,'' he said. `` You have to have a good, strong case before you can take somebody's license from them.'' HALT proposed speeding up the process of dealing with complaints, opening records to the public and having non-lawyers serve on independent commissions to monitor and investigate complaints. <PERSON> McPike </PERSON> said that in 1985, the most recent year for which figures are available, 20 states made disciplinary proceedings public after it was determined there was probable cause to warrant the filing of charges. Thirty-three states have non-lawyers serving on disciplinary boards, he said. Complaints are handled on the state level by organizations operated under the state's highest court. These organizations are run as arms of state bar associations or as separate disciplinary governing boards. The HALT survey, conducted during February and March, graded disciplinary agencies in five categories: whether the agency is subject to public review or control, allows public access to its proceedings, makes disciplinary records public, encourages the filing of complaints and has a `` fair and responsive'' disciplinary process. Thirty-three states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> responded to the survey. The rest of the states did not respond. HALT gave each state that responded a `` final grade'' based on the five criteria: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, D; <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, D +; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, D; <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, D; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, D; <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, C; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, C -; <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, F; <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>,

<HEAD>FAA: No `Grossly Unsafe' Planes at Eastern, Continental</HEAD>

 Federal authorities in more than 2,000 inspections of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airlines jets have so far found no `` grossly unsafe'' aircraft, according to the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said Thursday that 5 percent of the inspections uncovered `` minor'' safety infractions that required planes to be taken out of service and at times flights to be delayed. He characterized the percentage as not unusually high. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> began its plane-by-plane inspections April 13 and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said they will continue through mid-May. Both airlines are owned by the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest airline company, which also is under a special review by the federal government. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said his department's separate inspection of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s management and financial practices is half completed and `` everything is going very well. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> did not elaborate on any of the findings so far. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> met with reporters to announce a series of organizational changes at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> aimed primarily at giving the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters more control over its regional offices. But many of the questions turned to the probes of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its two airline subsidiaries. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said there have been about 1,000 aircraft inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and about the same number at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, with many planes subjected to inspections more than once at different airports. The two airlines together have about 580 planes. In `` roughly 7 to 8 percent'' of the inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and 3 percent of the inspections at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> the inspectors found problems that required the planes to be taken out of service briefly, although in some of the cases problems were corrected quick enough so that flights were not delayed. `` These are not unusual percentages,'' said <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, adding that they likely would be `` what we would find ... at other airlines'' undergoing a similarly intense series of examinations. In some cases, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> corrected problems before they came to the attention of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. `` So far, we have not found anything we would consider to be grossly unsafe on any aircraft,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. But he added that while the problems that were found `` appear to be minor'' they may be cause an erosion of the margin of safety if not corrected. `` We're dealing with the margin of safety'' that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> expects the airlines to maintain, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said. No details were available on the kinds of problems that <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors have found. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> mentioned in general that they included such items as dents or small tears in aircraft skin or `` minor leaks'' in equipment. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION> and <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> ordered the special review of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> aircraft on April 13 after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> became concerned about continuing safety violations at the Miami-based airline. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> also was hit with a proposed $ 823,000 fine because of earlier violations. Four days later <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> ordered the inspections expanded to include <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> as well. He said a search of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records showed that the agency had assembled a series of enforcement actions against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> that could lead to total fines of more than $ 1 million.

 Consumer advocates are joining a congressman's call for mandatory warning labels on toys that contain parts small enough for toddlers to choke on Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., said Thursday that labels stating `` Ages 3 and up'' seem to many parents simply like recommendations for ability levels and not a safety warning `` Too often the proud parent thinks ` my <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> and my <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> are so smart they certainly have the ability to play with this toy','' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairwoman of the consumer affairs committee of Americans for Democratic Action. `` Little does the unsuspecting parent realize that this is not an ability label, but is a danger label and should be followed absolutely,'' she said. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> has drafted legislation to require all toys with small parts to include a label with the word `` WARNING'' in capital letters and a statement that children under 3 can choke on the parts. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> prohibits toy manufacturers from marketing products with small parts to children under 3, but the agency has no labeling requirements. Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers print age recommendations on the toy packages, but many of those do not outline the potential health hazard. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a compliance officer at the commission, said the agency has asked certain companies to print small-parts warnings on their labels. But she said the commission has not made it mandatory because it would be difficult to prove a direct link between the lack of labeling and choking deaths and injuries. She said such proof would be necessary for the commission to issue a regulation.

 A Baptist minister who gathers his flock with automatic, pre-recorded phone messages says the best thing about his new telecomputer is that it always turns the other cheek. `` It takes no breaks for lunch or a drink of water. If somebody hangs up, it does n't get mad,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. `` One person ca n't make the calls this machine does in the same time frame.'' The telecomputer is programmed to dial phone numbers and deliver <PERSON> West </PERSON>'s message of the day to his congregation at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethalto </LOCATION>. If a dialed number is n't answered, his machine will redial every 30 minutes for three hours. If it gets a busy signal, it will redial every five minutes for 30 minutes. The message is changed every Saturday. West concedes that a taped message sounds impersonal, but said it's a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation of 525 members. `` People are actively involved in their own lives,'' he said. `` The church used to be the center of community life, but not any more.'' On the day before Easter _ when daylight savings time began _ the church members got this call: `` Hello, this is Pastor West calling. I trust you're ready for Easter. Do n't forget to turn your clocks up.'' The call also offered information about church services, and had room for parishioners to leave a message. West hopes to reach non-parishioners and invite them to attend First Baptist with the telecomputer, which can be programmed to call every phone number in <LOCATION> Bethalto </LOCATION> and the surrounding area. The pastor believes he could get two new members out of every 20 calls.

 Are you an easy mark for door to door salesmen? Do you lose receipts for cash down payments? Do you buy wrinkle cream from mail order companies? These are the types of questions players face in a new board game called `` Market Place,'' produced by the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Division of Consumer Affairs. `` We use nuts and bolts as the game pieces because the game deals with the nuts and bolts of consumer affairs,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebner </PERSON>, division spokeswoman. The game was developed as `` a good way for people to increase their knowledge about the pitfalls of being a consumer,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hebner </PERSON> said. The object of the game is to be the first to reach the money tree in the middle of the game board. Players advance around a winding track on the board by drawing a card and following its directions. Cards that can make players move back one space say things like `` You spent $ 40 for miracle weight loss pills that ` melt away fat while you sleep.''' Or how about `` You did n't read the fine print of the record club or book club offer.'' Cards that can help a player advance one or two spaces include `` You always get three written estimates before hiring a roofing contractor,'' `` You send all formal complaint letters by certified mail,'' and `` You never give out your credit card number to sales people who call you on the telephone.'' The directions on the cards are based on calls the division receives daily from consumers, Mrs. <PERSON> Hebner </PERSON> said. `` It's a simple game, but if people follow instructions and think about what they're doing, it will probably save them a lot of money and a lot of grief in the years ahead,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hebner </PERSON> said.

 After waiting a lifetime, a 79-year-old father of six will become in June the oldest man ever to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I'm here for one purpose only. I'm expecting to graduate and become a priest and from then on live the life of priest with whatever the duties are given me. That's it. I'm not trying to be a celebrity,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said Thursday. `` In a way, it's been working on me ... I do n't want it to interfere with my vocation,'' said <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, who is completing his final exams at <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and Seminary in this <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> suburb in central <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. A widower and the grandfather of 13, <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> will finish his exams next week as a B-plus student and graduate May 8 to complete his three years as a seminarian. He will formally enter the priesthood at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tarcissus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in his native <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and will be assigned to the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> diocese, where he hopes to work with the sick and aged. A heavy man, with a full face, wire-rim glasses, a neatly trimmed mustache and thick white hair, <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> hopes there is a lesson in his case that will help others his age who are uncertain about whether to commit to the church. He sums up that message as: `` Go for it. ... There is an opportunity. There is a place to be.'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> wanted to enroll in a seminary at age 18 after completing his schooling at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. But he was dissuaded by a priest who reminded him that there was no one to provide for his recently widowed mother. Instead, he went to work and took courses at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> universities. He married in September 1931 while enrolled in law school. He quit the next year without a degree as the Depression dragged on and `` encumberances were getting heavier and heavier. `` He became an insurance broker, and for the next 40 years pursued various other careers as a credit manager and adviser to a variety of company presidents In 1962, he took a position as jobs counselor with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, a position he held until retiring in 1975. During this period, he was active in the Boy Scouts and the church. He became a grand knight in the Knights of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. After his wife died of a stroke in 1984, <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> decided it was time to enter the priesthood. `` At that time, it was when I said, ` Lord, now I'm ready. There's nothing to hold me back,''' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> recalled. After deciding to become a priest, <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> then had to fight the skeptics and system that thought him too old. Only four seminaries in the country accept students of advanced age, and Holy Apostles agreed to accept him if he found a bishop to sponsor him. After 50 bishops rejected him, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bishop finally agreed to sponsor him. Four leading American seminaries, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> and a leading <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> scholar all have confirmed that <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> is the oldest to face ordination, according to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public relations firm handling publicity for <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>. `` We've overcome the obstacles that have been in the way, and there were a lot of them. And now we're on to ... the beginning, `` <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said.

 The blast that ripped a huge hole in an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> appears to be unlike any previous accident involving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes, say officials of the aircraft company. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, said Thursday night they had received only sketchy reports of the explosion, which ripped off the top of the fuselage just behind the cockpit to about the wing, injuring 60 people and leaving one person missing. Both executives said there were no fuel lines or other potential sources for an explosion in the first-class cabin, just behind the cockpit, where passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 reported that the blast occurred. `` The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the fuel lines are all right there,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home. Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore loose from one of the two engines and ripped into the fuselage in mid-flight, it could not hit forward from the wing and the effect would be nothing like what happened to the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plane, he said. `` To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not related to any other accidents we have had.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were sent from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to check the possibility that a bomb might have been put on the plane, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heafner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, also interviewed from his home, said the plane was one of nine 737-200s delivered to <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. The 737 series is <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s smallest jetliner and the company's all-time best seller, with total orders for 2,031 planes as of Thursday <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said 35 to 37 737s have either crashed or been disabled by terrorists, lightning or other means. The first 737-200 was put into service in April 1968, and nearly 1,100 remain in use today, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. It can carry as many as 120 passengers, depending on the seating configuration, and has a range of 2,600 miles. The 200 was the second version of the 737s and costs $ 17 million to $ 22 million each. Production of the model has ceased, with the last 737-200 to be delivered later this year, <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said.

 A mild earthquake rattled this desert community but there were no reports of damage or injuries, authorities said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON> plans to bequeath his $ 2 billion fortune to the foundation created by him and his late wife, making the charity one of the nation's 10 wealthiest, its director said.

 Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s angry charge that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was impeding the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three Iran-Contra co-defendants was a performance familar to lawyers who frequent his courtroom. A day after <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> accused the administration of intentionally withholding classified documents that he says the defendants were entitled to see, the veteran federal judge calmly acknowledged the government's fears about disclosing some of its most sensitive secrets. Having angrily said Wednesday that `` a stone wall is being built up between this court and the trial,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> took the bench in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday and discussed the problem in milder tones. He blandly described it as an `` obstacle caused by concerns in the government generally concerning the confidentiality of documents'' and offered `` to see if I can be of any help to this situation.'' The switch in the judge's courtroom demeanor was described by one lawyer as `` typical <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> _ bark, bark bark, meow, meow, meow.'' Another lawyer, who also did not want to be personally associated with a comment about a sitting judge, said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> `` blows hot and cold.'' Despite his changed demeanor, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> did not retreat Thursday from his earlier threat to dismiss the case unless the relevant classified documents are shown to the defense and made available for use at trial as evidence. That possibility is a very real one, particularly if independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is unable to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or other national security agencies to declassify sensitive documents <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> decides are needed as evidence for the defense. `` The government is obliged to make all relevant information available in some reasonable way to the defense and using the monolithic term ` government' might not be appropriate where the independent counsel really does not call the shots,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Veniste </PERSON>, a former Watergate prosecutor. Lawyers for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and businessmen <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, will be looking closely for material they can predict wo n't be declassified. As former guardians of some of the nation's most sensitive secrets, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> are in a unique position to help their lawyers find evidence that is beyond the court's reach. A successful search of the 300,000 pages of sensitive material collected by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> could lead to dismissal of charges they conspired to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. At an earlier hearing, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> referred to the complicated procedures for handling sensitive documents and remarked that <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` knows more about the methods than those in the classification system.'' With secret documents deemed relevant and admissable as evidence `` you end up with the double D's: declassify or dismiss,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who once prosecuted anti-terrorism cases for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know of any case since the Classified Information Procedures Act was passed not quite 10 years ago that has ever had the volume of relevant classified material that this one does,'' he said. The law contains elaborate procedures for determining whether classified material is relevant evidence for the prosecution and the defense. If the government wo n't declassify a document, it allows for deletions of secret material of substitution of summaries to enable the introduction of relevant evidence. But not all documents can be easily altered or summarized and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he wo n't spend much time on that process, particularly since <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> says 50,000 pages are relevant to the case. `` What is the government going to do, or the judge going to do if the government says ` we ca n't declassify this, It is just too sensitive'?'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. The problem is particularly acute in the Iran-Contra case because `` the essence of some of the crimes that are charged is classified activity,'' he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, who recently resigned as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney here, noted that `` it may very well be that some of that stuff is so sensitive under no circumstances should it be released.'' And if <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> is forced to dismiss the charges because there is too much classified evidence, `` so be it,'' <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON> said. `` That was how the statute was designed. That is the way it is supposed to work.''

 <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON>, the veteran socialist, pacifist, political writer and prison inmate who campaigned for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and championed African nationalism, has died, his family reported He was 99. <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> died Thursday night at <ORGANIZATION> Watford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hertfordshire </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He had been in the hospital since April 19. His family said he had been in bad health for some time but no specific cause of death was given. Paying tribute to him Thursday night, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Throughout the whole of this century, in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and in so many other countries, he was an inspiration to all who love liberty and work for socialism.'' <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the son of a clergyman, and was educated in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at the School for the Sons of Missionaries. During World War I, <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> became secretary of the No Conscription Fellowship. He was later joint secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, editor of the publication <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, joint secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and chairman of the No More War Movement and War Resister's International. In 1927, he was a fraternal delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in 1929, he was elected to the British <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator. In the early 1930s, he transferred his allegiance to the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, becoming its chairman in 1931. But he rejoined the main <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1946. Throughout his Commons career <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> campaigned for abolition of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, the unelected upper house of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, on grounds it was a bastion of privilege. But in 1964 he accepted a life peerage from Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, which automatically gave him a seat in the Lords. He said at the time that he accepted the peerage reluctantly, but he attended debates in the Lords regularly. <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> wrote about 30 books, mostly on politics and social issues. In his autobiography, he recalled encounters with his close friend the Irish-born playwright and socialist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>, the left-wing British author of `` 1984,'' `` Animal Farm'' and other books, and with <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, whose campaign for Indian freedom from British rule culminated in independence in 1947. <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> served five prison terms during his turbulent life. Two prison terms, one with hard labor, resulted from his militant pacifism during World War I. The other three stemmed from demonstrations against the hydrogen bomb, capitalism and racialism. He was a champion of African nationalism and during his years in the Commons was sometimes referred to by parliamentary colleagues as `` The Honorable Member for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Describing himself as a humanist but not an atheist, <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> once declared: `` I do n't know if there is a God or an afterlife and I do n't particularly worry about it. But if there is, the best way to prepare is to work for justice here now.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Foot </PERSON> said: `` He was one of the very greatest libertarian socialists of this century and all democratic socialists all over the world honor him.'' <PERSON> Brockway </PERSON> is survived by his second wife, <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, their son, and four daughters from his first marriage to <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey-Smith </PERSON>.

 A woman whose car plowed into an after-school crowd at an elementary school, killing a 4-year-old girl and a woman and injuring eight others, has been charged with negligent driving, police say. Witnesses said the two-door sedan crashed through a chain-link fence and careened across an asphalt playground before running up a short flight of stairs to where the crowd was gathered Thursday afternoon in an entryway of <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were mothers screaming, looking for their children,'' said <PERSON> Araceli </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, whose niece lives with her and attends the school. `` Almost every child that was on the floor had their mother next to them.'' Principal <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and teachers helped lift the car, which was lodged in the two-story building, to free some victims trapped beneath the wheels. `` I called for 10 ambulances,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. `` I told them there were bodies all over the playground.'' Two of the injured youngsters remained in critical condition today. <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 30, was waiting for her 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>, and her 12-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON>, when the accident happened. `` I was picking up my son when I turned my head and saw the car coming,'' she says. `` I just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away. The car missed us by a yard and a half.'' <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, 37, was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and negligent driving, Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. She was arrested near the school and freed after posting $ 100 cash bond and her driver's license. <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, a pupil at the school, said his mother apparently had come to the school to pick him up. `` Our opinion is that she was driving too fast for conditions,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of the police department's major accidents unit. He did n't know exactly how fast she was traveling but said Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, who suffered a bloody nose in the accident, was `` going over the 20 mph speed limit.'' There was no evidence of intoxication or use of drugs, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said, adding that authorities were investigating the possibility that the car's brakes failed or the accelerator malfunctioned. A police spokeswoman who declined to give her name said today she was unsure whether Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> honked her horn or tried to warn those in her car's path. <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>' niece, said she had been told the car needed repairs. `` She is a real good driver,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, 28. `` She never got into an accident.'' The schoolground was left littered with shattered glass, bodies and blood. `` Everyone was screaming and running around,'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Escarzaga </PERSON>, 18, said of what happened. `` Some ladies started praying.'' `` I was helping one mother because she kept screaming for help,'' Miss <PERSON> Escarzaga </PERSON> said. `` In school, they say when someone's injured do n't move him because they get can get worse `` I took off my jacket,'' she said. `` I took off my sweater and then put them both under a boy's head. He passed out.'' Authorities identified the dead as <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Marquez </PERSON>, 4, who suffered head and abdominal injuries, and <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, between 60 and 65. `` She waits there every day faithfully to make sure her kids get home safely,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, whose grandchildren attend the school. The school system will try to arrange a special memorial, said <PERSON> Manford </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to help those students overcome their grief,'' he said. `` If we have to do counseling, we'll do that.'' Authorities decided to open the school today because `` I think the teachers can help the children overcome this tragedy.''

<HEAD>`Chess,' A New Musical By Tim Rice and ABBA, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with other reviews; no PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 Life is just a game played out on a big checkered board, or so they seem to be saying in `` Chess,'' the heavy-handed British musical hit that lumbered into Broadway's Imperial Theater on Thursday night In this case, it's the theatergoers who are checkmated, trapped for more than three hours in a cold and unappealing musical that ranks as one of the season's biggest disappointments. That's surprising considering the show boasts a provocative, tuneful score with lyrics by <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and music by <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulvaeus </PERSON>, two members of the pop group <ORGANIZATION> ABBA </ORGANIZATION>. But the songwriters are shortchanged by director <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and playwright <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> who have fashioned a musical that is big on metaphor and short on credibility, not to mention entertainment. The plot, apparently reworked a bit from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production, is a romantic triangle involving a volatile and vulgar <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> chess champion -LRB- <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Casnoff </PERSON> -RRB-, his Soviet opponent -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> -RRB- and the American's second -LRB- <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> -RRB-, a Hungarian refugee who falls for the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> at the drop of a rook. The American is sort of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnroe </PERSON> of chess. The champion's manners _ and politics _ are somewhere to the right of <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. His distastefulness dulls one point of this love triangle, making it hard for the audience to wonder who will end up with whom, let alone who will win the big match. The triangle eventually becomes a quartet when it is revealed that the Russian has a wife -LRB- <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzman </PERSON> -RRB- back in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. She does n't show up until the second act, and by then the story has bogged down completely. The three chess players are manipulated by an assortment of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents as well as public relations types who sing and dance their way through the show. Everyone is the pawn of someone else, a soap opera message <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> reiterates with numbing frequency. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who previously worked wonders on `` Cats,'' `` Les Miserables'' and `` The Life and Adventures of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickleby </PERSON>,'' falters with this show. Like `` <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Miserables </PERSON>,'' `` Chess'' relies on a turntable to make the musical move. But it does n't work as well. Set designer <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> provides a series of gray, concrete-like columns that glide, swivel and turn around the stage. Their perpetual motion eventually becomes monotonous and even irritating. Much of the time, the characters just stand on stage and shout _ at each other or toward the audience. There's not much <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> can do with these argumentative moments, but when a number cries out for some musical movement, it does n't get any help. Consider the exotic song `` One Night in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>,'' a sizable pop success several years ago, and virtually thrown away here in an embarrassing flesh-peddling scene that looks like it was borrowed from a summer stock revival of `` The World of <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>.'' The show has been cast with strong voices, even down to the smallest roles. At a result, many of the songs soar in spite of the story. Miss <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> has a radiant voice, and when she does n't push it, the sound embraces the theater. Her quiet moments are the best, particularly `` Heaven Help My Heart,'' a delicate solo, and `` I Know Him So Well,'' a duet of commiseration that Miss <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> sings with the Russian's neglected wife. The songwriters also have provided some memorable music for the men, particularly the bitter `` Pity the Child,'' which contains <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s finest lyrics. It's an explanation by the American grand master as to why he turned out to be such a rotter. <PERSON> Casnoff </PERSON> succeeds too well in conveying the character's miserable personality. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, who possesses an even better voice, manages to make the Russian more than a milquetoast, not an inconsiderable achievement, considering <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s laborious plot. The performer brings the overlong first act to a thrilling conclusion with a ringing anthem to his homeland. As good as the score is, there is too much of it. The songwriters added several songs for the American production, including `` Someone Else's Story,'' one number that has likely pop potential. But less would have been more. The costumes by <PERSON> Theoni </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldredge </PERSON> are undistinguished, all-purpose modern clothes that are remarkably ordinary and, in the case of Miss <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, unflattering. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON>'s lighting at least tries to bathe <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s dozen or so behemoth columns in a soft, humanizing glow. It's that humane, personal quality which is missing from the rest of the production. The musical revels in its political message and its conceit of a chess game as a microcosm of real life. Not even the fine handiwork of its three gifted songwriters can make the sledgehammer symbolism of `` Chess'' palatable. In other reviews: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> writes in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that Chess is `` a show without a game plan. ... `` The characters are cliches, and not even appropriate ones. ... Neither of the love stories is emotionally involving. ... Visually ` Chess' is drab. ... The show is shrilly overamplified. ... `` The lingering question ... is why anyone imagined international politics was something to sing about.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> writes: `` Rather than condescend to throwing the audience a bone of genuinely romantic or melodramatic entertainment _ or even providing a tense chess game _ the authors pass the time pontificating about politics in sweeping generalities reminiscent of Mr. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>'s ` Evita.''' Referring to `` the musical's metaphorical equation of chess and war,'' <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> says: `` War is hell, and ... ` Chess' sometimes comes remarkably close.''

It contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high school students with weak skills, and greatly expands drug abuse education and magnet schools. New money also was earmarked for math, science and foreign-language programs. The largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoring and other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger of failing academically. Other initiatives in the bill include $ 50 million for `` Even Start,'' to jointly educate poor preschool children and their illiterate parents; $ 50 million for dropout prevention demonstration projects; and $ 200 million to improve basic skills of high school students.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman says an attempt by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid to cities with rent control has virtually been defeated.

The letter said the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control laws. `` The restriction can not go into effect until legislation has been adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by the president,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> had suggested making the change through federal regulation.

<HEAD>Yugoslavian Painter Returns To Chicago Looking For Portrait Of
Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An artist whose portraits over the decades have included <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> says he has n't seen his most treasured work in 26 years: a painting of his wife. <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Likan </PERSON>, 77, has returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to try to find the 30-inch-by-40-inch painting of his wife in a violet dress with a cat on her lap. She died last year. `` My wife was so beautiful. The picture really had a lot of charm,'' said <PERSON> Likan </PERSON>, who wants to acquire the picture from its current owner _ whoever and wherever that may be. The story told in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, began in 1962 when the struggling <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> immigrant could n't afford to repay $ 2,000 he borrowed from his brother-in-law to get his family to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> had made a name for himself decades earlier by painting portraits of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s young King <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and murals for Argentine first lady <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>'s schools. His brother-in-law filed a lawsuit to recover the money, and some of <PERSON> Likan </PERSON>'s paintings were auctioned by the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff. The brother-in-law bought the painting of Mrs. <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> for $ 355, but <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> believes it was then immediately sold. The brother-in-law and his wife died without children in the mid-1960s, and the two families parted ways after the disagreement, so <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> does n't know where the painting might be. `` It's a dream to have this picture,'' <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> said. `` Maybe the owner is rich. He does n't need the painting. It's worth a lot more to me, from an artistic standpoint and for my family.'' The painting was valued at $ 2,000 when it was auctioned, <PERSON> Likan </PERSON> said, adding that he believes it would be worth $ 8,000 today. `` It could be anyplace,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> of the police department's financial investigation unit. `` It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. `` I used to work at the galleries,'' <PERSON> Zurawski </PERSON> said. `` Paintings go for cash usually, and the buyer is usually just an initial.''

<HEAD>Dark Suntanning Losing Favor Among Fashion Leaders, Dermatologists
Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Bennetts is correct.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deep, dark suntans are fading from fashionability because of cancer and wrinkle fears, according to a survey sponsored by a dermatologists' group. But tanning-industry officials say the bronze look is alive and well. Fifty fashion leaders surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> were `` virtually unanimous'' in their opinion that the dark tan once fashionable is no longer in vogue, the academy said. `` The main reasons for caution under the sun are fear of premature aging and knowledge about skin cancer,'' the doctors' group said Those polled ranged from Cosmopolitan magazine editor <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> model-agency head <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the academy said in a statement promoting May as `` Melanoma-Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month.'' Doctors say the popularity of suntanning is partly to blame for the soaring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates of melanoma, a skin cancer that killed an estimated 5,800 Americans last year. `` There are still addicted-to-tan people who will never conquer the addiction,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the survey. `` The reason the rest of us are more careful is because of all the information being disseminated. You just could not avoid knowing, at this point, if you can read, that heavy suntanning does cause skin cancer.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> told the survey, `` Today's style is a healthy glow, not sun-baked skin.'' But those in the tanning trade point to booming business at tanning parlors, an increasing number of tourists at sun resorts and millions of dollars being spent on tanning aids. There are more than 275,000 commercial tanning beds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunsch </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a tanning equipment importer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It is not only the fashion in this country. It is the fashion throughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday. Vacations to sun resorts have not fallen off, either, according to figures from <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Med </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which sold 350,400 trips to its 109 sun resorts last year, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. That was almost a 16 percent rise from the 302,100 trips in 1985, she said. In the $ 450 million suntan-lotion market, products that promote tanning more than block it gained a slight market share from 1986 to 1987, from 46 percent to 52 percent, said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennetts </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for makers of <ORGANIZATION> Bain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>. She shared the view that lighter tanning is the trend and said her company, <LOCATION> Richardson-Vicks </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for the first time is adding a new product this season with the highest possible sun protection factor, or SPF, rating _ 30. `` And in our advertising for this current season, our model's tan is much lighter than in past years,'' she said in a telephone interview Thursday `` We like to think we're going to set what becomes fashionable.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor of Eurotan Professional Tan Accelerator, said people are buying his product faster than ever, and his company in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, has sold 500,000 bottles since February. Managers of two <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> tanning parlors randomly selected said they are having their best year ever. `` I really do n't see tanning ever going out of style, to be honest with you,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Neighbors </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Eurotan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Halsted </LOCATION>, which serves about 100 customers a day. `` It's been around forever.''

<HEAD>Fewer Than One In 10 Americans Knows Cholesterol Level, Study
Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you know your cholesterol level, congratulations. Most Americans do n't. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that only 6 percent of the adults surveyed in 32 states last year could recall what their cholesterol levels were. `` People do n't know their numbers,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> cholesterol specialist. `` We've got a long way to go to get people to know their numbers.'' The federal government's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System regularly asks people about their health and behavior. Last year, for the first time, interviewers asked randomly selected adults in 32 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> about their cholesterol. Less than half the respondents, 47 percent, had ever had a cholesterol check at all. Less than half of those people, or just 19 percent overall, said they had been told what their cholesterol level was. And of those people, fewer than one-third, or only 6 percent overall, remembered what the level was. `` In the past, a doctor might do a cholesterol check during a checkup, look at the reading, and tell the patient, ` You're fine,''' <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said `` What we're encouraging is for patients to say, ` I'd like to know what my number is.' `` And not only should you know your number, but you should know what it means.'' A cholesterol level of below 200 _ measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood _ is considered `` desirable,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. More than 200 is considered `` borderline high,'' and over 240 is `` high.'' Although the survey respondents' cholesterol could not be independently checked, most people who claim to know their cholesterol `` do a very good job,'' <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said. `` And if they do n't know the exact number, they may be able to classify themselves'' as high or desirable, he added. Evidence about the links between cholesterol and heart disease has grown in the past decade, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted in its weekly report. Government researchers believe a 25 percent reduction in cholesterol can cut a person's risk of heart disease in half. <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> said cholesterol specialists want people to know their exact numbers to avoid misconceptions. An old rule of thumb said that anything under a figure of 200-plus-patient-age was OK, but `` that's obviously passe,'' he said, citing the current standards. In the 32 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the percentage of people knowing their cholesterol ranged from 1 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to a high of 9 percent in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The percentage of respondents who had ever had a cholesterol check at all ranged from 29 percent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to 57 percent in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The margin of polling error for the surveys differed from state to state and question to question, but ranged from 1 percent to 4 percent. Differences from state to state `` may reflect differences either in the availability and use of ... cholesterol testing or in the respondents' awareness of the results,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Emperor Celebrates 87th Birthday, Reflects On Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people shouted `` Banzai'' and waved Japanese flags as Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch, appeared briefly on his palace balcony today to mark his 87th birthday. The emperor's birthday is a national holiday. `` Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today. I am happy that so many of you have come today. I hope you will all have a happy future,'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> said from behind bullet-proof glass in a speech carried live on national television. It was his second public appearance since he underwent surgery last September to bypass a tumor blocking his digestive tract. Doctors later said the growth was not malignant. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once worshiped as a living god, also spoke to well-wishers at the Imperial Palace grounds on New Year's Day. <PERSON> Nobuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimane </PERSON>, an accountant in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, was one of the estimated 35,000 who came in three shifts under a drizzling rain today and stood in a palace courtyard to see the emperor in his annual birthday appearance. `` I think this will be the last chance to see him because of his advanced age,'' <PERSON> Shimane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been on the throne since Dec. 25, 1926. Despite rumors of ill health, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> appeared relatively strong today, although he shuffled slowly as he walked. He was accompanied by Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> and other members of the imperial family. Missing was Empress <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, 85, who suffers back and leg ailments. In a news conference marking his birthday, the emperor said he was recovering well from surgery and answered questions about his memories of World War II. `` After all is considered, the war was my most unpleasant memory. I am pleased with people's efforts for peace after the war. Hereafter, I hope the people do not forget this matter and protect peace,'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> said. He refused to say what caused <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to enter the war in the first place, saying, `` I do not want to answer the question because this will involve criticism against persons.'' Foreign reporters were not alowed to attend the news conference, which was conducted Monday but not released until today. The remarks were carried in Japanese by the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and translated by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. During two previous news conferences for foreign reporters _ the last 13 years ago _ the emperor expressed his personal sorrow for `` certain things'' that happened during World War II. But he said he acted as a constitutional monarch before and during the war and did not play a personal role. He also denied planning the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> attack, but left many other questions unanswered. During this year's news conference, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Yoshihiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokugawa </PERSON>, his former grand chamberlain who retired earlier this month at the age of 81 after serving for more than half a century. `` He protected recordings of the emperor's announcement of defeat in the war -LRB- from soldiers who intruded into the Imperial Palace on Aug. 15, 1945 -RRB-. With his language abilities, he prepared well for my friendly visits to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so that my visits were successful.'' Soldiers had planned to seize the recording so the war could continue. They beat <PERSON> Tokugawa </PERSON> with a pistol, but he refused to say where the recording was hidden. When the disk was finally played, it was the first time most Japanese heard their emperor's voice. During that broadcast, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> urged his subjects `` to open an era of grand peace for the generations to come, by suffering the insufferable, bearing the unbearable.'' However, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> never used the words `` surrender'' or `` defeat.'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> also said in the interview that it would take him a long time to complete his research in marine biology, his favorite hobby. He said he had replanted an endangered plant species and `` it is growing well because the imperial garden is similar to forest land.''

<HEAD>Keepers Watch Condor Chick Through Dime-Sized Hole</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick conceived in captivity pecked a dime-sized hole in its egg, which anxious keepers gently poked and serenaded with recorded vulture sounds to coax the rare bird out of its shell. The chick should free itself by early Saturday, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>, spokesman at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Animal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where the chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair of the nearly extinct <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors. `` -LRB- The hole -RRB- makes our condor people's job easier,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They've been monitoring the chick's activity by close observation to detect movement of egg itself. Now with a direct view of the chick, we can tell every time it moves.'' The chick dislodged the dime-sized bit of shell Thursday on its second day of pecking at the egg, accompanied by a recording of vultures making hissing and grunting sounds. The recording was played at two-hour intervals to try to duplicate the sounds the chick would hear in a natural nesting environment. Condor keepers also occasionally tap the egg lightly with a metal rod to match the prodding encouragement of a parent condor. `` We are still getting response from the egg when we tap and play vulture sounds,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are happy at the response. It indicates to us the chick is still alive and strong. At this point, we just to continue to watch.'' Park officials have set a 72-hour deadline _ ending at 4 a.m. Saturday _ at which time keepers will intervene with forceps and tweezers and gently chip small parks of the shell until they can pull the chick out, he said. Officials do n't want to intervene prematurely because of the danger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, which could trigger fatal internal bleeding. `` It's an exciting time but a very anxious time,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do fear for over-exhaustion on the part of the chick. We'll all breathe a lot easier when we have a chick out of its shell and it indicates to us it is healthy and functioning correctly. The 10-ounce egg, about 5 inches long, has been under a 24-hour watch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks in one end. The `` pip'' cracks signaled the start of hatching, which usually takes about three days. A successful hatching would bring to 28 the known population of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird, a member of the vulture family with a wing span of 10 feet at maturity. All 27 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors known to exist are in captivity _ 14 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo.

 Passengers aboard a stricken <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner prayed and sang hymns while the plane wobbled 25 miles to an emergency landing after an explosion blew away part of the forward passenger cabin's overhead. `` There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up and we were looking at blue sky,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> said Thursday. He was in row 18, not far from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737's forward cabin where the explosion occurred. `` Everybody screamed,'' said passenger <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` However, it was very brief _ the panic. The explosion happened, the rest of the plane was intact, and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or anything like that.'' Sixty people were injured, two critically, and a stewardess was missing in the explosion aboard the jetliner, which landed at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with one engine aflame and about 15 to 20 feet of its front cabin exposed. The plane carried 89 passengers, five crew members and an air traffic controller. `` I think that people realized the plane was still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing whatever they could do to save their lives,'' <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> said. `` I think we flew for almost 15 minutes with half an airplane, so we were all well aware of what was going on.'' <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> praised the cabin crew for helping calm the passengers, some of whom hung on to one standing stewardess so she would not be sucked out of the plane by the howling wind. Another stewardess, <PERSON> Clarabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, who worked for the airline for 37 years, apparently was swept from the plane, officials said. An air and sea search coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> failed to locate her. The search was scheduled to resume at first light today. `` Well, I think the stewardess -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> -RRB- had just picked up the microphone to start talking,'' when the explosion occurred, <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said. Another passenger, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said the wind was so strong she was thankful no infant was aboard the plane because the child would have been blown away. Ms. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said that after the explosion she put on a life jacket and placed her head between her knees. `` We all prayed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> said. `` As long as those engines were running, the more secure I felt. I sang all the hymns I knew. That kept me busy.'' `` I'm alive! I'm alive!'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> shouted as a nurse pushed his wheelchair through the hospital.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims Ship Attack Off Iranian Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today its warplanes raided two vessels off the Iranian coast, resuming attacks on commercial shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> after nearly a month of quiet. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said the warplanes staged two raids late Thursday, hitting `` a very large maritime target and a large maritime target,'' a usual reference to supertankers and tankers. The broadcast quoted an unidentified military spokesman as saying the planes rerturned safely to base after scoring `` accurate and effective blows.'' He said the missions were designed to `` destroy the oil supplies of the aggressors who use the oil revenues to prolong the war.'' There was no immediate confirmation of either attack from gulf-based shipping executives. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> never acknowledges Iraqi attacks on vessels ferrying its oil between the <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> island oil terminal at the northern tip of the gulf and safer facilities in the southern part of the waterway. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has claimed sinking Iranian warships in the gulf during a land thrust earlier this month to recapture the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But the last confirmed Iraqi attack on a commercial vessel was March 30, when the Cypriot-flagged Anax was damaged in an air raid about 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is known to have attacked at least seven ships between April 12-23. The so-called `` tanker war'' is an offshoot of the Iran-Iraq war that began in September 1980.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo plans a major overhaul of of his government and party, which lost its parliamentary majority in a stunning election setback, his aides said today. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> plans to replace several senior Cabinet and party officials to apportion blame for the election defeat and to give the administration a more moderate image, the aides said. Presidential aides, who spoke on condition they not be identified further, said the changes in the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are expected to come as early as next week. One aide said the reorganization would be `` extensive,'' affecting presidential advisers and Cabinet posts, including the ministries of Justice and Home Affairs. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jae </PERSON> would not be affected, he said. Government and governing party officials said the strong opposition showing in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections has forced them to change strategy, to seek dialogue and compromise. `` Reform through dialogue would be a new form of politics,'' the aide said. Victims of the reorganization may include <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moo-hyuk </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, who was retained from the government of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, another aide said. The intelligence agency came under fire for alleged attempts to smear some important opposition candidates in Tuesday's elections. An extensive reorganization of the governing party is inevitable. Chairman <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-shik </PERSON> and other top officials offered to resign to take responsibility for the humiliating election setback, the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> aides said. In Tuesday's balloting, opposition candidates left the governing party without a parliamentary majority for the first time in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. Three opposition parties secured 164 seats in the 299-member National Assembly. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 125 seats and independents took 10. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> emerged as the main opposition party with 71 seats in Tuesday's election, said today that he `` would not oppose everything the government proposes.'' `` We will cooperate as long as the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> regime carries out its promised democratic reforms,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told reporters. Projecting a moderate image, the 62-year-old opposition leader said he would also cooperate to insure a successful staging of the 1988 Olympic Games, opening in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he would ask the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government to be `` magnanimous'' and allow <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in the Olympics. He said he has some ideas on ways of persuading <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to participate in the Games, but refused to disclose details before consultation with the government in May. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> also welcomed a proposal for a united anti-Roh coalition in the Assembly. He said he would closely cooperate with rival opposition leaders <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-sam </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong-pil </PERSON> of the New Democratic Republican Party. The three Kims, who won parliamentary seats in Tuesday's elections, said they would meet next week to work out a new anti-government strategy Party officials said the three Kims then will propose a meeting with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> that government officials say <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> will welcome. With <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Youmg-sam </PERSON> splitting the opposition vote, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won just 36.6 percent of the vote in December's election, the country's first direct presidential balloting in 16 years.

<HEAD>Polls Give Edge to Mitterrand After Debate With Chirac</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was judged today the winner of an acrimonious debate with rival conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> televised 10 days before voters return to the polls for the presidential runoff. Thirty-two percent of television viewers gave the socialist president the edge and 24 percent said <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> had won Thursday night's debate. Twenty-one percent called it a draw, 23 percent had no opinion. The poll of 800 adults was conducted immediately after the debate by the private firm <ORGANIZATION> CSA </ORGANIZATION> for the newpaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parisien </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>. No margin of error was given. Often biting and sarcastic, the debate was the first between <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> since they began sharing power in March 1986. The two drew on detailed figures and weaved sophisticated arguments in attacking each other's policies. Newspapers across <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> featured the debate on their front pages today. `` With this face to face debate, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> confirmed that cohabitation has been more difficult than either had let be understood before,'' the provincial daily Courrier de l'Ouest said. The leftist daily <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> said the debate: `` recalled a quarrel on a luxurious school playground.'' The conservative <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, like most newspapers, said it showed the men to be fairly evenly matched. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> used the debate to make a clear appeal to the extreme right, arguing that halting immigration was `` an imperious necessity.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> agreed that immigration must be reduced but said he would not take part in a `` witchhunt of immigrants.'' For <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, 55, the key to winning the May 8 runoff election could lie with capturing the votes of those who favor <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, leader of the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, running on an anti-immigration platform, achieved a stunning success in Sunday's first round of the presidential elections, garnering 14.4 percent of the vote, compared to 19.9 percent for <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, 71, won with 34 percent. On Sunday, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> is to advise his sympathizers how to vote on May 8. He has publicly ruled out votes in <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s favor. But he has said he is looking for concrete signs <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and his neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic would implement policies in keeping with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s goals. Thursday night's two-hour forum, in which two well-known journalists asked the questions, was billed as the major political event. The number of immigrants `` must of course be reduced,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said during the exchange. But he added that immigration was `` an exaggerated problem, sometimes purposely complicated ... that can not be treated without nuance.'' `` I will not participate during this presidential election in a witchhunt of immigrants,'' he said. `` Very simply, immigration must be stopped because <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> no longer has the means to give work to foreigners,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said. `` It is an imperious necessity.'' Using a term dear to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, he added, `` It's a problem of national identity, of the French way of life.'' `` You did n't wink there, did you?'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> interjected. The president appeared to command the first half of the debate, but <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> responded confidently and with animation on the subjects of immigration, taxes and security.

 Sikh militants inside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> exchanged gunfire with paramilitary troops holding one of their comrades outside the holy shrine today, security officials said. One woman visiting the temple was injured in the clash, police said. Police were put on alert throughout the city to counter any further violence, said <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the police superintendent. <PERSON> Nand </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, commander of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said the militants opened fire after a patrol spotted and tried to stop a wanted Sikh radical as he was heading for the shrine. `` As soon as the gunmen inside the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> saw us holding one of their comrades, we were fired upon,'' <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> said. The patrol returned the fire, he said, and rounds were exchanged for about 20 minutes. The Sikh militant, whose name was not given, escaped during the melee and took shelter inside the temple complex, <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> said. The militants were recently reported building bunkers and firing ports inside the complex, which includes the temple, offices and guest quarters. It is <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine. Security forces have entered the complex on occasion, but they generally try to avoid it because their presence would offend devout Sikhs. On Thursday, Sikh extremists killed 16 people in separate attacks throughout <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, including raids on two villages and a farm, security officials said. Villagers captured one of the gunmen, but police said the suspect committed suicide by taking a poison capsule while in custody, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The slayings raised to at least 850 the number of killings blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the extremists' 6-year-old guerrilla campaign for an independent homeland in the northern state. <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Virk </PERSON>, deputy inspector general of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said as many as 12 Sikh militants took part in a raid late Thursday on the village of <LOCATION> Ranpura </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. He said the gunmen ordered Hindus out of their homes and fatally shot five of them, including a 17-year-old girl. <PERSON> Virk </PERSON> said a letter left at the scene claimed responsibility on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Bhindranwale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, one of a dozen Sikh militant groups operating in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Two other Hindus were killed Thursday night by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> gunmen in <LOCATION> Mohamadpura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 18 miles west of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, police said. Sikh radicals also were blamed for a raid on a Sikh farmer's house in the district late Thursday in which four people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed Five other deaths were reported in scattered attacks. Sikhs, whose 500-year-old religion has roots in <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. They make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 A police sergeant killed during a raid on an alleged cocaine den was shot by one of two decorated police officers, not the pregnant woman blamed immediately after the shootout, authorities said. `` In these kinds of incidents, it's a little difficult to piece things together,'' Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. `` We got most of our information from the captain, who unfortunately was the last one in the room.'' Police backed off their earlier version after ballistic tests showed the bullet that killed Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> came from one of the two <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> revolvers used by police officers who were at the shooting. The bullet was recovered during an autopsy on <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, 43, a 19-year veteran who was nearing retirement. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> was shot in a room outside the bedroom where suspect Mercedes Perez scuffled with police. The fatal shot was fired by either Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huvane </PERSON>, 26, or Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 28, police sources said. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> has won 35 awards for his performance on duty; <PERSON> Huvane </PERSON> has received six awards. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who angrily demanded the death penalty for Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> after Wednesday's shooting, was `` distressed and concerned'' when he learned a police bullet had killed <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who was not at Thursday's news conference. `` The police commissioner yesterday made a generalized statement, which still holds true,'' <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was still to blame for the death, and `` the tragedy is a police officer was killed as a result of the actions taken by drug pushers. ... `` So, while she did n't shoot him directly, she's directly responsible,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who was shot twice during the spray of gunfire, gave birth to a baby girl after being taken to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia-Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Both mother and child were in stable condition. Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, criminal possession of a controlled substance and a weapons violation. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, was among a team of police officers who broke down the door of Ms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s apartment in upper <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. A search warrant said they were looking for 4 -LCB- pounds of cocaine. A subsequent search of the apartment turned up scales, four vials of crack, one marijuana cigarette, half an ounce of white powder believed to be cocaine, $ 2,000 in cash, drug sale records and an assortment of bullets, police said.

<TEXT>
 A former convict who hid his criminal past for 27 years while he became a civic leader and businessman was acquitted of fraud and grand theft charges brought by investors upset over his fake background. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>, 70, had been living under an assumed name for years and had settled into a busy civic-oriented life here before his past was disclosed three years ago. `` The nightmare is over,'' <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> said after the Wednesday verdict in <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that cleared him of three theft counts and one of fraud. <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>'s past caught up to him in 1985 when he was revealed to be convicted felon <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharby </PERSON>, arrested in at least seven states on various charges ranging from grand larceny to impersonating a federal officer. The disclosure cost <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> his job on the <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and left him scrambling to restore a carefully nurtured reputation as a good citizen. He gained a federal pardon and one from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> authorities, then had his civil rights restored by former Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. But in January 1987, <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> was arrested after three investors in his Port <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> locksmith business claimed they would n't have parted with $ 9,000 had they known <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON>'s background. The trial focused on whether <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> deceived three people he met through the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at a November 1984 stock sales meeting. The state claimed that through his false identity, <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> misrepresented himself to the investors. Among other credentials, <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> claimed he had degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Etta </PERSON> <PERSON> Breitenbach </PERSON> invested $ 5,000, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolan </PERSON> $ 1,000 and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> $ 3,000.

He did not elaborate. Indonesians have resettled an estimated 2 million people from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s densely populated Java island to the territory. The movement claims the migration is depriving native Melanesians of national identity and economic, social and educational opportunities. Immigration officials granted <PERSON> Frey </PERSON> and his family temporary one-month visas because they arrived without passports or clearance papers.

 Soviets will get a chance to munch `` Bolshoi Macs'' when the first of about 20 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> opens next year, officials from the city and the hamburger giant announced today. `` I think that the McDonald's in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be the highest volume McDonald's in the world,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malishkov </PERSON>, chief of the food service administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, signed a joint venture agreement today at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s city hall at a ceremony attended by reporters The agreement, which gives McDonald's of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a 49 percent share in the Soviet-controlled firm, is the latest <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> joint business venture with a foreign company. Last year, the Soviet government modified its legislation on foreign business activity in an attempt to woo foreign capital, technology and expertise. The reform is part of changes enacted under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> designed to increase the quality and quantity of consumer goods. <PERSON> Malishkov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zharov </PERSON> said the Soviets hope to draw upon the expertise of the fast-food chain to improve service in their country's food industry. The first Soviet McDonald's, a 650-seat location on Gorky Street in the center of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is expected to open in the second half of 1989. But <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> and the city officials refused to say exactly where the site is. `` We do n't want to create any lines,'' <PERSON> Zharov </PERSON> said with a smile. At that restaurant, Soviets will be able to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, the chain's trademark hamburger sandwich, for 2 rubles, or about $ 3. Another <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> location is projected that would cater to foreigners paying in foreign currencies. `` We're not thinking of just opening 20 McDonald's in this country,'' <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said. `` There will be many more.'' <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said a 100,000-square foot commissary would be built in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to process french fries, meat, buns, sauces and pies served in the restaurants. Both <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> and the Soviets said most of the joint venture's employees would be Soviet citizens, but that there would be some foreigners in supervisory and management positions <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said that through `` burger diplomacy,'' workers in the joint venture would learn to communication and become part of a team. As of the signing ceremony, what the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> McDonald's will call the chain's flagship sandwich appears to be undecided. An interpreter referred both to a `` Big Mac' and a `` Bolshoi Mac.'' In Russian, `` bolshoi'' means big. The foreign capital for the joint venture comes from <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>, which has 500 restaurants, 54,000 employees, and registered $ 1.25 billion in sales last year, <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said McDonald's branched into Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on March 24, when it opened a restaurant in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. It plans to open a restaurant this month in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, making that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation the 50th country around the world to have a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>.

 The bitterly divided <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> gather today to consider who will be their presidential candidate and how to prevent the governing party from falling apart at the seams. The centrist party of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s closest allies in the hemisphere, is suffering one of the worst crises in its 28-year history. It was resoundingly defeated by the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, in legislative and municipal elections March 20 and appears on the verge of collapse. About 1,800 party members are meeting at a hotel in this capital to discuss who will be their candidate in presidential elections scheduled for next March. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> on Tuesday called on the two main rivals _ <ORGANIZATION> Julio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prendes </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> _ to abandon their candidacies for the sake of party unity. The bitter year-old battle between them for the nomination has left at least two people dead and several wounded. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, both party founders and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members, rejected the president's suggestion on Wednesday and said they would continue their efforts. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> proposed <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the party's unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1967 elections, as a unity nominee. The party congress was to have endorsed a candidate in a non-binding vote and a party convention of 220 delegates had been expected to then make the final, binding decision. But <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> urged members of the congress and delegates to the convention not to make their final choice today. It remained to be seen if his suggestion would be heeded. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is limited by law to one five-year term, warned that `` we are threatening our very existence from within the party.'' Monsignor <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, seconded that assessment during a talk with foreign journalists Thursday. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> should resolve the crisis `` in a peaceful manner if they want to survive as a party. Otherwise the division will lead them to self-destruction.''

<HEAD>Fire Victims Camp Along Railroad Tracks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 10,000 people left homeless by one of the capital's biggest fires in 40 years pitched camp along railroad tracks near their razed shantytown, officials said today. About 300 children were evacuated to an elementary school in <LOCATION> Pandacan </LOCATION> district, the crowded neighborhood where officials said Thursday's fire destroyed more than 1,000 shacks and left 10,000 homeless. Relief workers distributed rice and canned fish today and set up a community kitchen for the victims, social welfare officials said. An arson investigator, Sgt. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, said police were still trying to determine the cause of the fire. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON>, the fire chief, said the flames destroyed a candy factory warehouse and virtually every building in a 25-acre area. The fire broke out about 1 -LCB- miles from the presidential palace. <PERSON> Madriaga </PERSON> said the blaze was `` possibly the biggest in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> since World War II,'' and that a shift in the winds prevented the fire from reaching a nearby oil storage area. His deputy said flames spread within eight yards of the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s depot. Firefighters were unable to move trucks into the crowded shantytown alleys and concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from reaching the oil storage area. Troops armed with M-16 rifles were sent to the fire scene after residents, angry that firefighters were not trying to save their homes, pelted firetrucks with stones.

<HEAD>Voyagers Warned To Avoid Ports As Strike Enters Fourth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vacationers heading for the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent by water were warned today to expect delays of up to 18 hours as a long weekend approached and a ferry strike entered its fourth day. Problems on the busy Dover-Calais route across the English Channel began this week when crews of the Sealink car-and-passenger ferry company refused to cross picket lines mounted by workers of another ferry firm, P and O, who have been on strike for three months. Sealink management and representatives of the 24,400-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION> met today through government mediators to seek a compromise after Sealink sought to curb the strike by having the union's assets seized. Sealink said only its French-crewed ships were sailing, halving the number of daily round trips to eight. No delays were reported this morning, but police cordoned off lanes of the highway into <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> to accommodate trucks likely to be stranded. `` Today and Saturday are expected to be very busy,'' said a Sealink statement. It warned that motorists with bookings could experience delays of about six hours later today. The statement said bus passengers could be delayed for up to 18 hours, while truck drivers faced even longer waits. Hovercraft services between the English port of <LOCATION> Folkstone </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> were normal but packed, said Sealink spokesman <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhouse </PERSON>. The longer Newhaven-Dieppe and Weymouth-Cherbourg routes linking <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> also were reported to be unaffected, but Sealink's Wales-Ireland crossings were disrupted. The action came on one of the travel industry's busiest weekends. Monday is a legal holiday in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and Sealink usually carries 150,000 passengers between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. P and O seamen have been on strike for 12 weeks, resisting an ultimatum on new pay rules and working conditions. This week, P and O strikers mounted pickets at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, the world's busiest ferry port, and Sealink crews have refused to cross them since Tuesday. A woman who crossed the line had `` scab'' daubed on her home in red paint. Under union-curbing laws enacted by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government, secondary picketing is illegal, and employers can sue the union involved for damages. On Thursday, <PERSON> Sealink </PERSON> made the first move in that direction by asking the High Court to order the seamen's union assets seized. The union threatened an all-out strike if its funds were seized. Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> urged Sealink and the union to `` talk, and talk fast'' before he adjourned the case for a day.

 Police stepped up security after reports that Palestinian terrorists were planning to bomb a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base and bars frequented by American servicemen, officials said today. <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police chief Lt. Col. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaspac </PERSON> told reporters the attacks were to be carried out during the weekend by eight Palestinians, and that four of them already were in <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Macaspac </PERSON> said the report was relayed Thursday to the Philippine Constabulary's Metropolitan District Command by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence service Mossad. He said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> and bars frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were the intended targets of the attacks. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> officials could not be contacted immediately for comment, but <PERSON> Macaspac </PERSON> said command officials were discussing security arrangements with Filipino and American authorities on the base. There was no unusual security activity visible on the base. <PERSON> Macaspac </PERSON> said Filipino police had stepped up patrols around the city, especially in housing areas for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel. Spokesmen for both the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies said they had no knowledge of the purported Israeli intelligence report. A sergeant who answered the telephone at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s information office declined comment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had tightened security around <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and four smaller installations after communist rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino in attacks near <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in October. In December, there were also reports that Palestinian terrorists had slipped into the country for a series of attacks here, but none materialized. Officials say there are up to 30,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, many of them in the country illegally. They include students, businessmen and tourists, officials say.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is holding fewer political prisoners since the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> took up the issue of human rights in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> last month, the country's attorney general said. `` I do n't have the exact figure at this moment, but I can say that figure now is lower,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION>. The dispatch from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, received here, said Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Roa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouri </PERSON> had used the figure of 458 `` counterrevolutionary prisoners'' during the meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> addressed the situation in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during a six-week session that ended March 11. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said the attorney general was asked if penal code reforms scheduled to take effect April 30 would benefit prisoners being held for crimes against state security. `` The policy that is followed with them is different,'' de la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was quoted as replying. `` It obeys a program that relates release with emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He noted that an agreement has been made on that subject with <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said last week on a visit to <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> indicated that hundreds of political prisoners could be freed from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> jails if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave them visas. During the meeting in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> accepted <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s invitation to send its first delegation to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to investigate allegations of human rights abuses. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> denies allegations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and others of torture and mistreatment of political prisoners. De la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> also said in the interview that the death penalty remains in force in the new code. He said, however, that all legal actions take place in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> within the law. `` We never have used nor will we use, as happens in some Latin American countries, disappearances, illegal executions,'' the attorney general said.

<HEAD>Rebels Urge West To Exploit Vietnam's Need for Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cambodian guerrillas said the West should exploit <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s urgent requests for food aid to increase pressure for the withdrawal of 140,000 Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` If aid is given ... it would be like a transfusion of fresh blood into the body of a blood-starved <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> writhing in its death throes, thus reviving it and enabling it to carry on its war of aggression in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said the text of a guerrilla broadcast, obtained today from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` We appeal to them instead to take advantage of this moment.. to bring greater pressure to bear on it and force it to quickly end its war of aggression in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said the Tuesday broadcast. The broadcast came over the radio of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978. A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recently said Vietnamese officials appealed for aid in a March 14 meeting in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> with representatives of foreign countries and relief agencies. According to official Vietnamese media reports, bad weather, disease, and insect plagues also have seriously damaged the rice crop early this year. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> is the staple crop in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Aid officials say they see no signs of starvation on any significant scale but there is widespread malnutrition. The Western envoy said the Vietnamese officials asked for fertilizer and insecticides to protect this year's harvests. The envoy said that would cost about $ 100 million and it was doubtful the international community would be able to provide it. The envoy, based in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier this month, Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> suggested to visiting Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, that food aid could be offered to peasants in areas where they were asked to help search for remains of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was outraged at the suggestion the two issues should be linked. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> broadcast said the food shortages were due not to mistakes in agricultural policy, as the Vietnamese government has claimed, but to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in an attempt to dominate all of <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> governed <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1978, and an estimated 1 million to 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> executions, famine and civil unrest.

<HEAD>Billy Graham Sees Better Future For China's Christians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said today he was encouraged by the growing but still limited religious freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and was optimistic about <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>'s future in the communist nation. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> also said he had been unable to substantiate reports that a Chinese itinerant preacher who spreads the Gospel in defiance of the state-sponsored church was arrested after arriving in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to hear the Southern Baptist minister. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, speaking at a news conference in this British colony at the end of his 16-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said he contacted high-level <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to get information about the reported arrest of <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhe </PERSON>, but received neither verification nor denial of the report. `` My wife and I have been praying daily for him if he indeed has been detained,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. He said he could not intervene in the matter but could `` relate my feelings about it and I have already done that.'' He did not elaborate. According to the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Xu was arrested April 16 after traveling to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> from central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to hear <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. The center has links to Protestants in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who worship in unofficial `` house churches.'' A source in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> with links to preachers outside the state-sanctioned church has confirmed Xu's arrest. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he did not know <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> and had not heard of him before his reported detention. The 69-year-old <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> spoke with government leaders and Christians from inside and outside the official Chinese church during his first <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trip, which took him to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. Christians form a tiny minority of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people. The official <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> church has about 4 million members, as does the official <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, which does not recognize <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> authority. Millions of other Christians are believed to practice their faith independently in the privacy of their homes. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said some people told him of persecution during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, during which religion was banned. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> also heard of Christians still suffering discrimination in income, housing, education and social status because of their faith. The evangelist said he was `` encouraged that there is now a limited, I'd like you to underscore the word ` limited,' ... measure of religious freedom and that thousands of churches have reopened in recent years. I expressed the hope there will be steady progress toward greater religious freedom for all believers.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he was `` very optimistic about the future of the Christian faith in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Christians in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could be salt and light in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> society, and could be a great moral and spiritual force for good in the nation where God has placed them.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he would like to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but indicated he probably would not speak before huge stadium crowds as he has done in many of the nearly 70 other countries he has visited.

 Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> does n't have to surrender to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in order to challenge his drug indictment, a federal judge has ruled. `` The best way to avoid the appearance that this indictment has assumed the character of a political proceeding, rather than a legal one, is to determine its legal validity upon the arguments of counsel,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> said Thursday. The judge gave <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, 10 days to submit challenges to the Feb. 4 indictment. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> said he would set a hearing date after the government responded. <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> hailed the ruling, which does not affect a separate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> drug indictment in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` I think it is an outstanding legal victory for Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and a well-reasoned opinion on the part of Judge <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>,'' the attorney said. The lead prosecutor in the case, Chief Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, was traveling Thursday and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON> has said that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> wants to challenge the indictment he should surrender himself. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is accused in the 12-count indictment of taking at least $ 4.6 million in payoffs from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> to protect cocaine shipments, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shelter the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> gang leaders from law enforcement. <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, who has traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, cited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> draft resister cases in which attorneys were allowed to make arguments while their clients were in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The judge agreed, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` has not yet sought extraditon of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and it does not appear likely that it will seek extradition in the near future.'' In another development, it was disclosed Thursday that the federal prosecutor whose office issued the Feb. 4 indictment naming <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will resign June 17 and rejoin his former law firm. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, whose office is responsible for the southern district of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the nation's busiest in terms of caseload, will resign for personal reasons, said his executive assistant, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> departed for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today to meet with leaders of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in a bid to improve political and trade links with the region. The prime minister is making his first trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since he became prime minister in November, although he has visited <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> seven times in other capacities. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday that there are imbalances in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In the area of trade, it is true that significant imbalances still exist,'' he said. `` It is necessary for us to turn the existing structure of an uneven triangle into a right triangle.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> accounted for less than 10 percent, or $ 28.9 billion of the country's total trade of $ 305 billion in 1985. Trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> amounted to $ 71.1 billion or 23.3 percent of the country's overall trade in the same year, according to Japanese figures. At the same time, trade imbalances between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries continued to grow. In 1987, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> chalked up a surplus of $ 20 billion in trade with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statistics. In 1986, it was $ 16.7 billion. Bowing to pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers, such as taxes and restrictions, on imported liquor and wine, the Japanese government decided in January to revise its liquor tax system to boost imports of foreign liquor. Trade relations have improved in recent months. Between January and March this year, Japanese imports from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> increased by 52.3 percent, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. `` We wish to further encourage this trend,'' he added. During his 11-day trip, the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> leader will meet with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on April 30, and his Italian counterpart <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMita </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 2. Then he will fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 3 to meet with Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on May 4. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is scheduled to give a major speech on May 4 in a luncheon in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district, in which he will outline his plan to have <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> play a larger role in world affairs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the `` <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> plan'' calls for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase its official development assistance and to provide money and personnel for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. He will wrap up his tour with a meeting with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on May 5 and hold a press conference on May 6. He will leave <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> May 8 and return home on May 9. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is also sceduled to visit <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in early June.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today urged President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not to veto legislation requiring companies to give notice before closing plants, telling union members that workers `` deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` I hope the president will take the time to think about the three million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers who lose their jobs in this country every year through plant shutdowns,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In at least half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _ their own employees.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> referred to trade legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week but which the White House says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will veto because of an amendment requiring notice before plants are closed. Republican opponents say the measure does not belong in the trade bill and would be undue government interference with business. `` These people are our neighbors,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in prepared remarks. `` They deserve better from their employers. They deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> where primaries are scheduled next Tuesday. After taking a break back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> following his huge victory in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> over his only remaining rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was speaking to a meeting of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> labor leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 683 Hall in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. He resumed attacks on corporate mergers and acquisitions which he said provide profits for `` Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams'' while costing workers their jobs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> on Thursday night, had stops today including a rally in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> and a visit to a high school in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backers here expressed confidence that momentum from victories in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will help him roll up a big win in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> as well. State Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaign chairman, pointed to a statewide network of 170 public officials supporting the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. However, Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> has not taken sides. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> was to appear with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but also planned to join <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for a church service on Sunday in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been in the state most of the week. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has 159 delegates up for grabs Tuesday, with another 24 to be added at the convention by various Democratic procedures. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor released copies of letters sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders urging enactment of the trade bill. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I believe that our record trade deficit requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that will be in the best interest of all Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in the letter. He said the bill `` will help return the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a position in the world where we can once again compete successfully with all of our trading partners.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would make the trade bill a major part of his attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes the measure. `` I think the issues of workers being laid off, what is happening to the industrial base of this country, and the failure of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new president would do to work hard with business and labor and community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our industrial base will be very much one of the major issues,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made the plant-closing issue a campaign theme in the industrial states. He has called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, to publicly urge <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the trade bill.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today denounced a television documentary that contradicted the official version of the killing of three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas by British commandos. `` The freedom of people depends on the rule of law, a fair legal system,'' she told a Japanese television interviewer. `` The place to have trials is a court of law. Trial by TV or guilt by accusation is the day that freedom dies.'' Television authorities rejected a government request to delay the broadcast, and the hourlong documentary `` Death on the Rock'' aired Thursday night. The program said the guerrillas died while trying to flee or surrender to the commandos in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> had said the guerrillas `` made movements which led security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.'' <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said it received scores of calls after the broadcast, running about 3-2 against the decision to screen the film. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> called the broadcast `` grossly and wholly improper'' and said in a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio interview that it had `` inevitably'' been shown on satellite TV in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, where it might influence an inquest jury. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, legal political arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said the allegations showed clearly the guerrillas were `` summarily executed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> program featured people due to testify at the inquest in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> and complained that their accounts would influence the hearing. It had asked <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, chairman of the controlling <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, to delay broadcasting the program. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> turned down the request, denied the documentary would prejudice the inquest and said postponement would give the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> more `` oxygen of publicity.'' <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> said the documentary was the result of a seven-week investigation which included interviews with 150 residents of apartments overlooking the area where the guerrillas were shot March 6. In the documentary, translator <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON> said she saw the shootings from her apartment window in the British colony that borders <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON> said she saw three armed men in plainclothes get out of a police car, jump over a metal barrier in the road and open fire on two of the guerrillas, later identified as <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30. `` When they -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> -RRB- saw these men had guns in their hands, they just put their hands up ... There was no chance. I mean they went to the floor immediately, they dropped,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON> said. She described the guerrillas' action in putting their hands up as `` like giving themselves up.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON> said that after the initial shooting, which she said occurred without warning, `` a blond gunman bent down and with the two hands he got his gun like that and went on shooting at them.'' Others described seeing the third guerrilla, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24, shot in the back as he tried to run away. Mrs. <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON>'s account appeared to contradict <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s March 7 statement to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that the guerrillas were challenged as they walked toward the nearby <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> border and were slain because they `` made movements which led security personnel to believe their lives were in danger.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said at the time that the guerrillas had been on `` active service,'' meaning they were planning an attack. The <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in which nine people, including two British soldiers, died. The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 A gynecologist was charged with sexual battery after he allegedly handcuffed his wife and performed an abortion on her, authorities said. The 52-year-old doctor, who operates a clinic where abortions are performed, was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors said he could face more charges. `` If in fact this occurred, and this person is a physician, it's beyond comprehension,'' <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Budetti </PERSON> said Thursday in setting bond at $ 50,000 The doctor, who refused to speak during the hearing, posted the bail.

The gynecologist allegedly handcuffed his wife Sunday as she was lying in bed, took her into the bathroom and performed an abortion on her 11-week-old fetus without anesthesia because she refused his sexual advances, said police spokesman <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON>. The doctor told her as he performed the abortion that if she did n't stay still, he would inject her with something to calm her down, police said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> talks aimed at shoring up oil prices bogged down early today in a technical debate that one cartel leader called a `` waste of time.'' A nearly four-hour meeting over a proposal to cut oil exports in conjunction with independent producers broke up early today without any agreements, and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> said they would reconvene this evening. They said no agreements had been reached. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, told reporters later that it was impossible to predict whether an accord could be reached, since `` there's a wide divergence'' of views among the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. The oil ministers are considering a proposal from six non-OPEC oil producers to cut both groups' exports by 5 percent in an effort to push <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil prices back to $ 18 a barrel. The non-OPEC group says it will cut its exports only if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> does likewise. But opinions differ sharply within the cartel over whether further cutbacks are needed, and there are indications some members _ including influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ favor enforcement of existing output quotas over new cuts. World oil prices continued sliding early today as the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders struggled to resolve their differences. On the European market, <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> crude oil from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was down 35 cents a barrel, at $ 16.80, at mid-afternoon after having lost 30 cents on Thursday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil markets had n't yet opened. Traders said the declines reflected doubts that the oil ministers' meeting would produce a concrete agreement on measures designed to boost the oil market. Prices have fallen this year because supplies have risen faster than demand. Most OPEC crudes are selling for $ 16 a barrel or less, although oil traded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> usually sells for more. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the most widely traded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 29 cents to $ 17.98 dollars a barrel on Thursday after dropping 33 cents the day before. Prices on European markets fell about 30 cents a barrel on Thursday. Some industry analysts believe prices would rebound if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> accepted the non-OPEC offer. But others doubt that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could agree on reductions large enough to make a difference in the global balance of supply and demand. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s opening debate focused more on differing views of the oil market's supply and demand balance than on the merits of the non-OPEC group's proposal, according to sources who spoke on condition they not be identified by name or nationality. In an apparent effort to bridge the gap in these views, the oil ministers instructed a team of experts from each member country to meet today to assess the present and near-term market balance. <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s oil minister, told reporters he was unhappy that time was being devoted to a meeting of experts, which he said only would highlight the differing views between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries. `` This is, in some sense, a waste of time,'' he said. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said one suggestion under consideration was to forego the proposed export cuts in favor of recommitting the 13 members to existing oil production quotas, which often are violated. `` We know that several countries have been overproducing for years,'' he said, without naming the countries. `` ... If we can have a full guarantee that these countries are going to abide by their quotas, that would improve the market situation. But I have a lot of doubt about that,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was alone among the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members in stating its clear support for the non-OPEC offer. None have rejected it outright. <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> oil minister, declined to say whether his country favored the non-OPEC proposal, made Wednesday by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. But Saudi King Fahd on Thursday bolstered the impression of many industry analysts that he would not accept any cuts in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production or exports. He said the cartel's main goal should be to stick to its existing production limits. `` I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling and convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limiting their production,'' he said in an interview published by a Kuwaiti newspaper. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacoboski </PERSON>, who was observing the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>'s statement was `` the real nail in the coffin'' of expectations that the cartel would accept the non-OPEC proposal.

<TEXT>
 Defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> are continuing their campaign to put the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on trial for the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scandal. On Thursday, they got a prosecution witness to admit under cross-examination that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> hired a distant relative of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> partly `` because of his contact with the vice president.'' But the witness, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> former chief financial officer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON>, denied that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, related to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by marriage, was hired as a management consultant to win <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to obtain a multimillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract Shorten said <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> was hired before he joined <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shorten </PERSON> did not think <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> was still working for the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> defense contractor in 1984 when a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pontoon contract was up. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, confirmed that <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> is related to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> through marriage, but said the vice president had nothing to do with contracts. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>'s younger sister, <PERSON> Margie </PERSON>, is married to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife's older brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said he stopped working for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in the fall of 1981 although payment for his consulting services was strung out until early 1984. <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, reached at his <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home, also denied speaking or writing to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to get a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pontoon contract. `` If they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- had any influence with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I did n't get it for them,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said he did write the vice president at least twice on the company's behalf about an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> engine contract in 1981. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received five or six letters from <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>. `` We have looked into this before and I have seen the letters,'' he said. `` The vice president either did n't respond to the letters or in the cases where he did respond, they were very cursory responses. `` We have no records of any type of involvement or any action involving <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts that would suggest the vice president took any position one way or another.'' He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as chairman of the president's regulatory relief task force, often gets letters from small businesses. In the courtroom, Shorten also said he was told by a close friend of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that he would have President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> overrule the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> if they did not give the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. The witness is one of four former top <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives who have pleaded guilty to state and federal charges. All four are now cooperating with the government in exchange for leniency. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and six others are accused of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, now bankrupt, into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts through a program for minority-controlled businesses. Defense lawyers have tried to show that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials had close links to high-ranking officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and did not need the help of a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>.

 By her daughter's account, <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> put cyanide in pain relief capsules to poison her husband of 12 years for as much as $ 176,000 in life insurance benefits. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, however, says she loved <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> more than money, and her defense lawyer notes that her daughter, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 28, came forward after pharmaceutical companies offered a $ 300,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of whoever was responsible for the tampering. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury will likely begin deciding between those two accounts Monday in the nation's first death-by-product-tampering trial. Testimony before the 12-member panel and Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> ended Thursday after a government witness supported part of Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s version. Closing arguments were set for Monday, followed by instructions to the jury and the start of deliberations. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 44, is charged with five counts of tampering with over-the-counter medicine, including two involving the death of her 52-year-old husband and Sue <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, in June 1986. Both died after swallowing cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin. Government lawyers claim she tampered with other pain-relief capsules and put them on store shelves to cover up the killing of her husband. The last witness, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, said she was rooming with Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> in November 1985 when Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> reported what she thought were her mother's plans. `` <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> came home and said ` <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>, do you know what my mother just said to me? She asked me how much cocaine it would take to kill a person,''' Ms. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> testified. `` She said that her mother had been talking about getting rid of her -LRB- step -RRB- father ... she was getting tired of him.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> had testified Tuesday that her mother discussed putting cocaine in <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s iced tea to make his death look like an overdose. In cross-examination earlier Thursday, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> noted that shortly before <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s death, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had twice written a bank to which they owed money to say she was taking over the finances and that the couple's `` marriage problems'' would soon be resolved. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> responded that she loved her husband and did not try to hide insurance policies, all signed by her, from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators. She confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an investment company $ 8,553 at the time, plus a lot more to clear titles on their land and mobile home, but she denied that their financial situation was getting worse and noted that both were employed. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>, asked if she were responsible for the crimes. `` No,'' she replied. `` The thought never entered my mind and never would because I loved <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> too much. There's no way I'd ever think of getting rid of him.'' The prosecution also introduced evidence showing that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had checked out library books on poisonous plants in 1983 and 1984. She said she had borrowed the books to make sure that plants on her rural property were n't harmful to her grandchildren.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> dissolved his Cabinet and the Parliament today and called new elections in a dispute over legislation to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights. The official Radio <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said general elections would be held July 24. Earlier today, 16 Cabinet ministers belonging to the main party in <LOCATION> Prem </LOCATION>'s coalition government submitted their resignations after failing to stop party dissidents from voting against the government-backed bill to protect American copyrights. The <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ministers _ representing about a third of the Cabinet _ resigned because `` they could not control'' the party dissidents, said Col. <PERSON> Sanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kachornprasat </PERSON>, the party's secretary general. The radio announcement said <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> and would continue at his post until the election. Prem, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s longest-serving prime minster, has headed five Cabinets since assuming his post in 1980. The last general election was held in 1986. The dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> forestalled a probable opposition motion to censure the government over its handling of various issues, including economic problems and recent border clashes with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The censure motion had been expected May 9. The House of Representatives passed the copyright bill 183-134 on Thursday, but 32 legislators in the dissident group joined members of opposition parties in voting against it. The dissidents said the legislation, which protects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights of artistic and literary works, would force <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to bow to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bullying. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had indicated that it might be forced to cut duty privileges for Thai imports if the measure was n't passed. Music and videocassettes and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products are widely pirated in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The legislation is expected to be approved by the government-appointed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> today welcomed passage of the copyright bill, although it did n't meet an American demand that it specifically protect computer software. The legislation left that question to the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> courts. `` We are prepared to await the determination of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> courts as to whether or not software is covered under the existing Thai copyright law,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>. `` We believe computer software should receive copyright protection.'' The 67-year-old prime minister has been criticized for indecision on a number of issues, but others have noted his contribution to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s general stability and economic progress in recent years. The former military commander was preceded by a procession of military-led coups and major government changes. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> survived two major coup attempts by dissident military officers in 1981 and 1985. But he has maneuvered quietly and deftly to undercut potential opposition from the military and is widely believed to enjoy the backing of King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON>, the country's highly respected and powerful monarch.

 Defense attorneys, after listening to 22 weeks of government testimony and 115 witnesses, will begin presenting their case Monday in the cocaine-smuggling trial of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s two attorneys, said earlier this week that the defense case may only take two weeks, but estimates in this marathon trial have been notoriously conservative. When the jury selection started in October, attorneys said they expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months. But, counting jury selection and a two-week Christmas recess, the trial has ended its 30th week. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, accused of being one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, are being tried on charges of conspiring to smuggle some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s private island in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, from 1978 to 1980 The prosecution wrapped up its case shortly after noon Thursday following the presentation of interviews <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> gave earlier this decade on Colombian radio and television. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> had argued that the presentation of the tapes was essential to his case, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> ordered references to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and the slaying of Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> edited from the tapes. The judge denied motions from defense attorneys for directed judgments of acquittal to the charges contained in the 11-count federal indictment. In the tapes, the jury heard <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> deny several times that he was a drug smuggler. `` I have never admitted that I have dealt or done any business with drugs,'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> said in a jungle interview in 1985. In the same interview, however, he said, `` This is about political action, and cocaine has become _ and marijuana has become _ a revolutionary weapon in the struggle against North American imperialism. `` Stimulants from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are the Achilles' heel of imperialism. That's why the persecution against us is not legal, it is political. But I have never been arrested in possession of any drug whatsoever.'' The Colombian also made anti-American statements, calling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a country guided by <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine ... guided by a society, let us say, drunken on pornography.'' He also opposed the extradition treaty that eventually resulted in his arrest on the charges for which he is being tried. `` So then they say I conspired against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I say that not only did I conspire but that I conspire now and that I shall continue to conspire until the day the ... extradition treaty is canceled.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy.

 The government said today it did n't know the leader of an Armenian terrorist group who was assassinated outside his <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> home had lived in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for the past year. <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was gunned down before dawn Thursday as he waited for a taxi in front of his suburban apartment. Police sources said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for at least a year, posing as a Lebanese businessmen. He was founder and chief of the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` Authorities in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> did n't know his identity,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> also carried a South <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> diplomatic passport in the name of <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, who was not registered as a diplomat here, had not been working in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> and a woman identified as his sister-in-law were standing in front of <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>'s home when two masked men emerged from a car. One man shot <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> twice with a sawed-off shotgun and fired again when the victim tried to run. The assailants fled. The woman was unhurt. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing. The assassination could have been the work of a rival extremist group, said Armenian sources in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. Police at first identified the victim as 39-year-old <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashim </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Aden </LOCATION>, based on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemeni </LOCATION> diplomatic passport he carried. `` He'd lived in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for at least a year _ possibly longer _ as <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON>, but he traveled abroad very frequently on the <LOCATION> Yemeni </LOCATION> passport,'' said a police source who spoke on condition of anonymity. But after reports from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the dead man was the long-sought leader of the terrorist group, his wife, <PERSON> Janil </PERSON> <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON>, confirmed he was <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Police said Ms. <PERSON> Titizian </PERSON> told them her husband recently arrived from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and was on his way to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The group, founded by <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> in 1975, has claimed more than 60 attacks against Turkish targets, including the killings of about 30 Turkish diplomats and dependents in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Marxist organization seeks the foundation of an independent Armenian state in eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and vengeance for what they claim was the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1916. The Armenian sources said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1945, and that his name was most likely a pseudonym. He ran the group from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with funding from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and leftist groups but dropped out of sight in July 1982. His group claimed responsibility for the July 1983 bombing of the Turkish Airlines desk at <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that killed eight people and injured 56. <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>'s former second-in-command, <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Melkonian </PERSON>, formed a splinter group called ASALA-Revolutionary Movement after the <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> bombing, complaining that <ORGANIZATION> ASALA </ORGANIZATION> had abandoned its original policy of focusing only on Turkish targets. <ORGANIZATION> ASALA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed only one attack in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, the killing of Turkish diplomat <PERSON> Galip </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozman </PERSON> and his daughter in August 1980. The group's political wing, the <ORGANIZATION> Armenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, has operated an office in the Greek capital for several years. Turkish officials say 300,000 Armenians died after Ottoman Empire officials deported the country's 1.4 million Armenians to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> during World War I. Independent historians say at least 600,000 Armenians died during the journey.

<HEAD>Health Group Plans To Push For Stronger Restrictions On Accutane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group affiliated with <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> plans to push the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to more severely restrict a powerful anti-acne drug that causes birth defects, a doctor representing the organization said today. `` We have an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> with strong laws but weak enforcement,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that has long been critical of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` American families are too important to be left to a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that seems to give deference to the drug industry,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel recommended earlier this week that the drug Accutane remain on the market because it is the only effective cure for severe acne. But it urged that additional warnings be added to new packaging to further discourage use by pregnant women and that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> find a way to legally restrict the drug's distribution The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is not bound by the advisory panel's recommendations. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said Public Citizen would file a petition with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to implement strong restrictions and is considering filing a lawsuit. He recommended that dermatologists who prescribe the drug be required to sign a sworn statement that they will not misuse it. Accutane's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> LaRoche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>, had proposed new packaging that would more effectively warn against its use by pregnant women. The manufacture acknowledges 62 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases of birth defects caused by Accutane since the drug was introduced in 1982. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said there could be several hundreds more and thousands of abortions induced because of fear of the drug's side effects. A confidential <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> memorandum reported last week by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> estimated that between 900 and 1,300 cases of birth defects were caused by Accutane between 1982 and 1986. `` The company has sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of this drug and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> seems resistant to doing something that would significantly reduce the sales,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` It's a very important drug,'' he said, `` and the question is why ca n't it be limited carefully to the smaller number of people who really need it without giving it to a larger number of people and allowing pregnant women to get the drug?''

 Americans are just as concerned about drug trafficking and foreign economic power as they are about U.S.-Soviet nuclear weapons according to a recent survey.

 Workers today struck a heavy machinery plant in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in an escalation of the nation's worst labor unrest in six years, opposition leaders said. The government denied a strike had begun at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> plant and threatened to fire anyone who did strike. Thousands of steelworkers at the giant Lenin mills outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> continued their strike for a fourth day demanding higher pay and union rights. Opposition spokesman <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said 21 Solidarity activists were detained across the country today, an indication communist authorities' tolerance for worker defiance was waning. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is not dramatic,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said at a hastily called news conference. He said `` an attempt to organize a strike'' failed at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. Urban said plant management would fire any workers who took part in a strike. Contacted by telex, the plant was repeating a recorded message that work was `` going on normally'' and that a rally by workers had ended. Labor Minister <PERSON> Ireneneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> said at the news conference with Urban that the government would announce in a few days tax law changes and other measures to allow enterprises to meet growing worker pressure for higher pay. Consumer prices have gone up by 42 percent so far this year. Urban also said there had been an unspecified number of `` preventative detentions.'' He did not elaborate. The strike at the 18,000-worker machinery plant in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> began with the first shift this morning, according to opposition activists and the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankowski </PERSON>, a priest in the town 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The priest said workers rallied outside plant headquarters. The police presence was heavy in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and at least four local Solidarity activists were detained, according to <PERSON> Frankowski </PERSON> and Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. Strikers were demanding $ 50 monthly pay raises and the reinstatement of dismissed Solidarity activists. Thousands of workers continued their occupation of the Lenin steel mill, outside the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. The strikers began their action Tuesday, demanding higher wages, recognition of union rights and more money for retirees, teachers, and industrial and health care workers nationwide. Strike committee member <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Mach </PERSON> said today that about 13,000 strikers were inside the steelworks, around which the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> was built in the 1950s. He said his committee had not negotiated with management since talks broke off early Thursday. The steelworkers were warned Thursday that their strike was illegal. Their leaders said management had threatened to use force to end it. The head of the government-sanctioned union at the 32,000-worker plant, <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitkowski </PERSON>, said he planned to resume today talks with management that began Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Mach </ORGANIZATION> said the strike committee rejected the official union taking any role in the dispute. Organizers said at least 16,000 people had stopped work at the plant in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION>, staying on premises for two shifts and going home to rest for one. The government was clearly concerned the labor unrest might spread. Sunday is May Day, international Labor Day and a traditional time of anti-government protest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, was dispatched Thursday to the Lenin mill. He is national head of the officially sanctioned trade unions. Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Zdzislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>, who the official new agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said would appear on television to discuss the economy, postponed a visit today to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON> is chief architect of the government's effort to make the economy more market-oriented through reforms that have included the price increases. The unofficial strike committee at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, whose 16 members include Solidarity activists, have demanded a 50 percent increase of the average monthly pay of $ 105. It also said the $ 15 paid monthly in compensation nationwide for recent price increases should be doubled for industrial workers, teachers, health care workers and retirees. This week's labor unrest is the most serious in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since strikes in 1980 over food price increases that spawned Solidarity and brought down a government. The unrest ended with the December 1981 imposition of martial law. On Monday, transit workers in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> staged an 11-hour strike and won a 60 percent raise. A day later, the strike began at the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> works.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he wo n't give up his Democratic presidential bid despite a string of losses but he says his role now is `` to raise distinctions'' between his positions and those of Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Thursday underscored what he considers <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' weaknesses _ domestic economic proposals and the situation in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ and he said that his own platform offers voters a clear alternative to the front-runner In contrast to the conciliatory tone he has struck throughout the primary campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> appears to be taking off the gloves a bit with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In speeches Thursday he also criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor for not having a plan to pay for his proposal to provide higher education for every young person. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wants to keep his campaign issues on his party's political agenda even if he does not become the Democratic nominee. But he said he is not conceding the nomination to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the governor is pulling away from him in the delegate count. `` My role now is to raise distinctions and give people a choice,'' he said. The AP delegate count shows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has amassed 1,276 delegates to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 852, with 2,081 needed to win the nomination this summer. `` I've got my second wind,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a gymnasium full of fans at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ` ve just begun to fight.'' As for comments attributed to his campaign manager, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, implying that the campaign was now focused less on winning than on contributing to the party, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the AP: `` Our campaign is a campaign of commitment and content. There is no conflict between campaigning to win and having issues of content to make a difference. `` We are trying to win.

I want to reverse Reaganomics.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` to the right of Reagan'' on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is willing to provide weaponry to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> against alleged South African-backed rebels, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not do so. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also lobbed criticism at <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, saying in the interview that <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> should have stepped in when <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was savaging <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as an anti-Israel candidate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also indicated unhappiness with the party's oversight of delegate selection in some states and in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>CDC Reports Infant Mortality Decreasing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The number of infant deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decreased, according to a report by the federal health officials. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that for every 1,000 live births in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1984-85, premature deaths robbed those infants under age 1 of 694 years of life they would have had if they had lived to be age 65. That was down 7 percent from the average of 749 years for 1980-83. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measures `` years of potential life lost'' _ by people dying before 65 _ as a way to gauge the killers of younger people. Sixty-five is used as a statistical benchmark; most Americans' life expectancy is higher. Since the number of infant deaths depends in part on the number of infant births, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> looked at the `` years of potential life lost'' averages to gauge trends in infant mortality. Deaths of infants between birth and age 1 take the greatest amount of `` potential life'' of all; in 1985, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recorded 40,000 such deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> found that between 1980-83 and the period 1984-85, the `` years of potential life lost'' due to prematurity and low birthweight, respiratory distress, birth trauma and other factors went down for both black and white infants. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, in its weekly report, particularly noted a sharp drop in potential life lost to birth trauma and asphyxia _ down 33 percent for whites and 31 percent for blacks. `` It makes us curious to look at why,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said that `` the marked decline ... due to birth trauma -LRB- or -RRB- asphyxia'' suggests either better care for newborns at birth, better neonatal care for babies suffering from birth trauma or asphyxia, or both. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also found that non-white infants die prematurely more often than whites, although death rates for both groups are declining. `` Although there were fewer years of potential life lost for -LRB- both -RRB- whites and blacks, there's still a big gap between those two groups,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. In recent years, she noted, `` there have been programs and strategies initiated to try and diminish the excess numbers of deaths among blacks and other minorities. It will be a while before we can evaluate those efforts.''

 A man claiming to be the father of an 18-month-old boy found wandering in traffic a month ago has contacted authorities. The man, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zephyrhills </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, said he last had contact with the toddler last fall in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> Police Detective <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` He said he was the child's father. And he provided information that leads us to believe he could be,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. If the identity checks out, the reason for the separation probably will be revealed as being domestic-related, the detective said. `` Apparently he heard about the case on the news. It triggered his interest. And more things began to fit,'' said <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. `` Little Kenny'' has been in protective custody since March 25 when he was rescued from traffic. Since photos of the child were published last week, more than a dozen people have offered to adopt him. The day after the boy was taken into custody, a man claiming to be the toddler's uncle reported his 18-month-old nephew missing from the same area. The man, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> `` Smokey'' Kwil, told <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> police he first saw the boy on March 23 in a bar. The child was with <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON>'s half-brother, <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> told police During the night the half-brother borrowed a motorcycle and left for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said although <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON> has told conflicting stories as to what happened to the boy, it appeared the child wandered away from <PERSON> Kwil </PERSON>'s trailer not far from where he was found in traffic. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, who met with police and with child-care officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilatative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, told authorities he had not known the whereabouts of his son. Health service officials had listed the toddler with `` Child Find'' in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and the national registry for missing children.

 Hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated on the Moslem Sabbath today. Sources said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops were scouring south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a crackdown on Arab guerrillas who sneak across the border into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that a small <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army force entered the Lebanese villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rachaiya </PERSON> el <LOCATION> Foukhar </LOCATION>, both about five miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, and questioned several dozen residents. Security sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> confirmed that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and their <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> allies were carrying out searches but said most were not in villages but in the rocky terrain in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern sector. The sources, who spoke to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said five Lebanese villagers had been detained. An army spokesman said two militiamen from the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed today when their vehicle ran over a land mine on a side road in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone north of the border. The interrogations came after two guerrilla infiltrations within two days this week in which two Israeli soldiers and five Palestinian guerrillas were killed. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, several hundred Arabs demonstrated outside the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque after the noon Moslem prayers, chanting `` Palestine is Arab'' and `` Jews leave because the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s army is returning.'' The demonstrators dispersed without confronting police, who were stationed nearby. Some of the protesters waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and shouted slogans about <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, who was assassinated April 16. Israeli sources have said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos killed him, but the government has not confirmed it. In the surrounding streets of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> shopkeepers began opening their stores promptly at 2 p.m., the hour that leaders of the five-week-old uprising have dictated for shops to open during the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police have tried to force <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants to open all day, or not at all, in a move to break the hold of uprising leaders on the shopkeepers. Underground leaders of the five-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands had called for marches and symbolic funerals today, the Moslem Sabbath, to honor Arabs killed in anti-Israeli protests. But the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> appeared quiet today. In a new step aimed at curbing Arab demonstrations, the army announced Thursday that parents in the occupied lands would be held liable for offenses of children under the age of 12. Despite claims by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders that the Arab rebellion was waning, the death toll rose again Thursday with the killing of a protester in <LOCATION> Malek </LOCATION>, a village near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. Soon after entering the village to search for rioters, troops were surrounded by hundreds of young Arabs who hurled stones and then a firebomb, the army spokesman said. The troops fired in the direction of the firebomb thrower, killing a Palestinian, he said. It was not immediately clear if the slain youth threw the firebomb. The killing raised the Arab death toll to 175 since the violence began in the territories last Dec. 8. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-ager have also died. A general strike Thursday in the occupied lands, called for by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, seemed to be as widely observed as any such strike since the uprising began. Arab reporters noted that in many areas even bakeries and street vendors, who normally stay open during strikes, were shut. Arab protesters blocked roads in several cities in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and taxi and bus stands in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> were empty.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said today he does n't like the idea of taking <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats off anti-drug patrols and moving them to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> `` I think the average American citizen feels more threatened by drugs'' than by events in the gulf, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat told reporters. `` I do n't think it's a good idea to rob the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of its principal missions here, one of them being anti-drug efforts.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments came a day after the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will overwhelmingly vote to block tentative plans to send <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats to the gulf. `` It's not going to even be close'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., referring to a proposal introduced to stop the plan now being considered by the Pentagon The ban will be voted upon by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week as the chamber continues consideration of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. Even though the bill wo n't become law for several months because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has n't yet considered its version of the same measure, a strong <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote against the plan will likely kill it, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said Thursday. `` As a practical political matter, the administration would not be wise to do something that a large majority of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is against, and this amendment will win easily,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> explained. The tentative plan calls for taking six of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s 110-foot Island-class patrol boats off anti-drug duty and sending them to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> Built for shallow waters, the boats would help the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol the war-torn area. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers, raising fears in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be drawn into the Iran-Iraq war because of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ties with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. There have been several U.S.-Iran naval clashes, most recently April 18 when <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and planes sank or damaged six Iranian vessels. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday that he `` would be delighted'' to send the ships to the gulf if ordered to do so. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said the move would have only `` a minimal impact'' on anti-drug efforts because new Island-class builts are being built and other ships could be pulled into the anti-drug effort off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coasts and in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. But the plan has run into heavy fire on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., a co-sponsor of the measure to which <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> referred, said, `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should use the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s scarce resources to fight the war on drugs, not the Iran-Iraq war. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> is strapped for money, and has responded to a $ 100 million shortfall in its current budget by closing more than 30 shore installations and cutting anti-drug patrols by 55 percent. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has offered to pay any costs of sending the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels to the gulf, said <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>. Though part of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also has national security responsibilities and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ships often operate with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> vessels. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations transportation subcommittee, where he defended the plan. But when questioned earlier about anti-drug efforts, he admitted, `` You can always use more'' money and boats. `` It seems to me we're going to hurt our drug efforts'' by sending the boats to the gulf, said Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, was even more critical `` I think it's an incredible policy,'' he told <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>. `` We kind of bumbled our way into this.'' But <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said: `` This is not an idea off the top of somebody's head It was well thought out and researched.'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> disagreed. `` Sending the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to the gulf would be just another tragic, dangerous and poorly conceived move by the administration,'' he said.

 A team of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists headed into the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert today to begin a series of experiments they hope will prove that a cheat-proof ban on all testing is possible. The experiments today and Saturday come on the heels of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s passage of a bill Thursday forbidding all but the smallest nuclear tests, if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to do the same. Scores of seismic monitors have been set up to record three non-nuclear explosions in remote areas of the state to try to demonstrate that if a U.S.-Soviet test ban treaty is signed, any infraction could be detected. If the experiments are successful, they would show that `` any chance for cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, <PERSON> Evgeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said, `` We think the comprehensive test ban is very important. It is extremely important to stop the arms race.'' The experiment is part of an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the privately-funded <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> tests will set off 10 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> 15 miles northeast of here and 100 miles north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> today and another 10-ton blast tonight in <LOCATION> Lathrop </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. A 15-ton charge was to be detonated Saturday in <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The blasts will be monitored at three permanent centers surrounding the Test Site, including one in <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Bishop </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the Soviet technicians have installed a ton of their own scientific devices for the first time in this country. `` Typical underground nuclear explosions are measured in hundreds or thousands of tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>,'' Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, senior staff scientist of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> told the news conference. `` By detonating only 10-15 tons, we will show that it is possible to detect very small explosions.'' By comparison, the bill passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday called for a ban on all underground nuclear explosions equivalent to more than 1,000 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to do the same. One objection to a test ban has been that low-yield blasts could go virtually undetected, particularly if they were muffled in deep caverns. The equipment being used in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is designed to be sophisticated enough `` to feel the difference between nuclear and industrial explosions and ... very small earthquakes,'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> said. In addition to the equipment from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Natura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> are taking readings at 23 sites and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey has installed 120 seismometers and recorders along a line from the northwest corner of the state to its southern tip 450 miles away.

 Gunmen today killed a farmer acquitted of killing a separatist leader in 1984. He was the first European settler to be killed in this <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island territory since the latest wave of separatist violence began a week ago. Separatist guerrillas who kidnapped 23 lawmen freed an assistant prosecutor and ordered him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists. The killing of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapetite </PERSON>, 31, on his farm on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s west coast brings to seven the number of deaths since Melanesian separatists attacked a police station April 22 on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> All of the victims until now have been either gendarmes or native Melanesians. <PERSON> Lapetite </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, said he heard shots fired from the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> about midday but did not see the assailants. <PERSON> Lapetite </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Petite </PERSON>, 62, was reported missing after the attack and believed kidnapped by the gunmen, but he was found at his home, said friends of the family who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapetite </PERSON> and three other brothers were implicated in the Dec. 5, 1984, killing of 10 <ORGANIZATION> Melanesian </ORGANIZATION> separatists in <LOCATION> Hienghene </LOCATION>, on the island's east coast. Among those killed were two brothers of <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a political movement seeking independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Seven European settlers accused of the attack, including the Lapetites, were acquitted by a court in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> last October. Native Melanesians, who make up 43 percent of the territory's 145,000 people, are known as Kanaks Many of them desire independence. About 36 percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> are European, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian. Most of the population wants to remain under French control. Assistant prosecutor <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianconi </PERSON> was released from a cave on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> and told to pursue negotiations with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Bianconi </PERSON> was the second hostage in two days released to mediate. On Thursday, Capt. <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Legorjus </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> anti-terrorism force, flew by helicopter to talk to French authorities in <LOCATION> Fayaoue </LOCATION>, a village on <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>, an island of the northeast coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The kidnappers threatened to kill their remaining hostages if the men did not return to the rebel hideout, a system of caves 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. Legorjus, <PERSON> Bianconi </PERSON> and five police officers were seized by the separatists Wednesday as they sought to negotiate the release of the 15 lawmen kidnapped on April 22. The hostages were among 27 people abducted in a bloody attack at a police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve of those hostages later were freed. The attack was aimed at halting Sunday's French presidential elections on the island. Also on Thursday, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, minister for overseas territories, said in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> that he has asked the government to outlaw the Kanak front. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> referred to the Kanak front as a `` terrorist faction'' that does not represent the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonian </LOCATION> population. `` I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> said during a televised debate with Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, his rival in presidential runoff elections May 8. `` What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and judicial offical,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. `` But what counts tomorrow is dialogue.'' <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON>, the No. 2 leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> political group, said banning the organization `` would not settle the crisis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> and will not stop the <LOCATION> Kanak </LOCATION> people from taking the fight for independence to its end.'' An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>. The kidnappers demanded police reinforcements be removed from the islands. They asked that mediators be sent from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to discuss a new referendum on self-determination.

 Thunderstorms raced across the Northwest today, bringing heavy rain and strong winds that ripped down trees and power lines. Lingering April showers continued to drench the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, with flood warnings posted in two states. The thunderstorms developed Thursday night across eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> with winds gusting to 63 mph at <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. In northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, winds whipped down power lines and trees, sparking a fire east of <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION>. Scattered showers fell elsewhere across western portions of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.

 A mentally retarded man who lived on <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>'s streets was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of another street person who was borderline mentally retarded. A jury delivered the verdict Thursday against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 30, after 13 hours of deliberation. The conviction carries a mandatory life sentence. The body of the victim, 33-year-old <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, was found in an alley a year ago. She had been suffocated. The two-week trial included testimony from about 50 people, including street people, neighborhood residents, social workers and police detectives. Among those testifying were people with mental disabilities who were on medication and had difficulty remembering events. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, said he will seek to get the verdict dismissed on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction.

 Customs investigators in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> seized 3.5 tons of Afghan hashish in the first-ever narcotics bust involving <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, authorities said today. `` The drugs came from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, overland through the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet authorities got wind of that and agreed to cooperate in tracking them, letting them out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> so that we were able to seize them here,'' said Home Office Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>. Officers tracked the drugs from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, by rail across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and by sea from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Tilbury docks, said a Customs and Excise spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity He said five men, all British, were arrested Thursday night. It was not known whether the Soviets made any arrests on their own territory. The spokesman said the seizure, codenamed Operation Diplomat, arose from a visit by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year. During the visit, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> discussed ways of cooperating against drugs. In July, officials from both countries got together to work out practical arrangements for fighting drug smuggling, and a memorandum of understanding was signed in February. Just before this, Soviet authorities intercepted the hashish, hidden in 400 sacks of liquorice root and packed in two containers. A <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> customs agent traveled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and plans were made to find the drug traffickers. The Soviets agreed to let the containers continue their journey under surveillance. British investigators took over the watch when the containers left <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, and when they reached <LOCATION> Tilbury </LOCATION> a month ago the drugs were secretly removed from the cargo, which was then repacked and kept under observation, the spokesman said. Last Thursday, officers watched as the containers were collected from Tilbury and driven to a warehouse in an industrial zone on an abandoned <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Warrington </LOCATION>, northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The load was then moved to storehouses in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and the customs investigators began making the arrests, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, despite a new emphasis on arms control initiatives and economic improvements, continues to build and modernize its military might in pursuit of an advantage over the West, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said today. Releasing its seventh annual assessment of Soviet forces, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported there were signs the military competition between the two superpowers would soon expand into new fields _ for example, the development of high-tech conventional weapons instead of nuclear arms. Indeed, the strategic nuclear balance `` is essentially stable,'' the report states. To date, however, `` we have seen no evidence of the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> changing the offensive nature of its force structure and deployment patterns,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> in a preface. `` Military output has not been reduced nor has military spending decreased. On the contrary, the Soviet military budget under General Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> continues to grow at a rate of 3 percent per year at a level representing 15 to 17 percent of their GNP.'' By comparison, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending consumes about 6 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s GNP. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, appearing at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> press confidence, cited several other developments, including the fact the Soviets now have two operational long-range nuclear missiles that use mobile launchers _ the SS-24 and the SS-25 _ while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has none. He also highlighted what he said was the first extensive, unclassified review of a Soviet program to construct underground bunkers, command centers and secret subways to protect their leaders in the event of a war. `` There can be only one purpose for these shelters _ to provide the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership the ability to fight a protracted, nuclear conflict,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> asserted. `` These facilities contradict in steel and concrete Soviet protestations that they share President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.'' But while Soviet military power is `` formidable,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> continued, `` we must not be overawed.'' `` Rather, we must strengthen our resolve to preserve our security and our freedoms. There is no mystery as to what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should do in the face of Soviet military power,'' he said. This year's review is the last to be prepared by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The 175-page glossy booklet differs substantially from the earlier reports in that it tries harder to gauge who's leading in various technologies and regions of the world, rather than just reporting what weapons have been added to the Soviet arsenal over the last year. Indeed, the report for the first time carries a subtitle: `` An Assessment of the Threat,'' and acknowledges that in areas such as naval power and high technology the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its Western allies still enjoy an advantage. The report does point to new weapon developments, though. Among them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The Soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new Blackjack long-range bomber Deployment of the new rail-mounted SS-24 nuclear missile has now begun, and production should start soon for a more accurate version of the huge SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile, the mainstay of the Soviet arsenal. _ Production of self-propelled artillery pieces is at an `` all-time high;'' two new attack helicopters, the Havoc and Hokum, `` are expected to enter serial production soon,'' and the Soviets have begun fielding `` a new tank derived from the T-72, exhibiting improved protection, better mobility and enhanced firepower. _ <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> will complete a major upgrade of its anti-ballistic missile defense system protecting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` in 1988 or 1989. A new `` Pill Box'' radar to help with tracking and targeting for that system is `` nearing completion at <LOCATION> Pushkino </LOCATION>.'' _ `` The Soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of sophisticated cruise missile systems,'' and continue to lead the West in the pace of their activities in outer space. _ In the area of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is unlikely to develop small `` kinetic kill'' rockets that could be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long range The Soviets could, however, `` deploy a short-range, space-based system for space station defense or close-in attack by a maneuvering satellite in the near future.'' The report also spotlights for the first time Soviet efforts to develop the equipment needed for `` radio-electronic combat'' _ the use of electronic jamming and deception techniques to disrupt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied radio communication systems. On the strategic nuclear side, the report concludes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can deter a Soviet attack and continue to press for additional arms control agreements, so long as it continues President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program of introducing weapons such as the B-1B and Stealth bombers and the MX missile while pursuing Star Wars research.

 <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, a human rights activist who died suddenly in a Czechoslovak jail, had asked the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> human rights conference to make sure he was not silenced in prison, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, condemned <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s imprisonment and said the conference had a `` special obligation to <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> and to people like him.'' The conference adopted the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on human rights in 1975. Prison authorities did not explain <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s death and official media in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> have not reported it. Human rights groups have said that the activist was beaten in detention. <PERSON> Frantiski </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolezel </PERSON>, the chief Czechoslovak delegate to the conference, said <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> died of emphysema. `` As we record and mourn his untimely death, we must also condemn the wholly unjustifiable imprisonment and mistreatment he suffered while serving his term,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said. <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, who was released Feb. 26 after serving a 21-month prison sentence, was to be under `` protective surveillance'' for three years after he was freed. He was rearrested on April 5 and sentenced to another five-month jail term on unspecified charges April 21. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said that in his March 3 message, <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> said people in the Soviet bloc should be made more aware of how their laws affect their rights and freedoms. `` My right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the constitution of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Experience, however, has taught me not to depend too much on such declarations,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON> as saying. `` Therefore, I have learned to be careful and I am taking the liberty to ask the ... governments of all the signatory states to see that my voice is not silenced _ under some pretext _ in prison,'' the message said. Several international groups have asked the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> government to allow independent doctors to attend <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>'s port-mortem. <PERSON> Wonka </PERSON>, an auto mechanic by profession, had sought to run for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as an independent candidate for his hometown in northern <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff has been removed from office by a judge who ruled that he had failed to comply with court orders, falsified court documents and kissed two women against their will. `` I definitely feel betrayed, and I definitely feel my intentions were not to do anything wrong,'' said former sheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. `` I do feel like ... the things I have done in law enforcement, I tried to do right.'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, 59, said after Thursday's ruling that testimony by current and former employees had confirmed his suspicions that many of them were working against him. He said several lied, or were mistaken, in their testimony about events at the department. `` I think I had a fair hearing,'' he said. `` The one thing I would say is, it helped me find out what I wanted to find out about the people I was dealing with. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobgood </PERSON> said he found evidence supporting all 14 allegations made in a petition filed by District Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Easley </PERSON> that sought <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' removal for willful misconduct or maladministration in office. <PERSON> Easley </PERSON>'s petition followed <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' guilty plea last month to misdemeanor charges of obstructing justice and attempting to obstruct justice. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> admitted he informed an attorney associated with a local country club that state <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> agents were on their way to the club for a raid on beer selling without a permit. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> testified Thursday that his actions were not intended to obstruct justice, but the judge found that he `` knew or should have known'' that his telling about the raids would result in illegal beer supplies being hidden before agents arrived. The judge also found that the sheriff directed one of his deputies to falsify a jail record to show that a defendant had served time in the county jail. The judge also ruled that <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> violated court orders by allowing the temporary release of inmates to visit their families or to perform cleanup duties for the county. <PERSON> Hobgood </PERSON> also found that <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> had kissed two women _ one 15 and another 20 _ without their consent. County Coroner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> will serve as interim sheriff until the county commissioners name a replacement to fill <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>' term, which expires in 1990

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who once threatened to resign if compelled to take a lie detector test, has authorized limited and voluntary use of polygraphs in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criminal and security investigations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in a statement he submitted Thursday to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee, sharply questioned the accuracy of such tests. `` It should never be acceptable in matters affecting the reputations and the livelihoods of individuals,'' he said. And yet, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` lie detector tests have a limited place in our security program'' in certain situations. He told the committee these included requests by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers to establish their innocence and in criminal counterintelligence or personnel security investigations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said a third circumstance for their use was when a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee volunteered to work in an intelligence agency that required polygraph tests. But, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, the tests would be given only with the consent of the individual. `` It is no secret to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or to this committee that I have consistently opposed the use of lie detector tests as a tool for screening or managing people,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Nor do I believe that we can single out one class of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees for special treatment just because they are called a security service.'' He said the regulations in which he had authorized lie detector tests were `` clear, circumspect in scope and protect individual rights.'' In December 1985, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would resign rather than be forced to take a polygraph test under a security program that had been ordered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He called the tests inaccurate and unscientific. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> subsequently gave <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> discretion to decide whether polygraphs would be given in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has reached a tentative agreement with Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> under which he will resign as defense chief but remain on in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the time being, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. The official, insisting on anonymity, said the settlement is `` less than ideal'' because the administration had initially insisted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> upon his resignation as part of a transition to democratic rule. `` We have to settle for three-fourths of a loaf,'' the official said. The administration had been concerned that any solution that allowed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to remain on in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> could enable him to retain effective control even if he surrendered his post as commander of the Defense Forces. But the official said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, once he steps down, would be like a `` cop out of uniform'' and would cease to be the dominant force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political life. The timing of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s resignation and the question of whether he eventually will go into exile remain up in the air and are subject to future negotiations, the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is known to prefer the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> if he is forced into exile. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> hinted that the admininistration was backing away from its demand that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of a settlement. The administration goal, he said, was for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to `` leave power.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had indicated earlier the arrangement did not represent a policy change, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others had said in previous statements no acceptable settlement could be reached until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` Our policy is that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go, which means leave power. We've talked about that a number of times. We have said we prefer him to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but the policy issue is to leave power.'' On March 22, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he'd be satisfied if the military strongman would step down, but not leave his country. `` We feel <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the president replied. On March 28, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, `` The way to end this crisis is to get him -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- out of the country.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted unnamed sources as saying that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has agreed to resign in `` a matter of weeks'' and would permit free elections and the restoration of constitutional government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said only that he would be willing to step down from his post before national elections set for May 1989 if certain conditions are met. The scaling back of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand occurred as a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for his second round of talks with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in less than two weeks. The official said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today. The administration has not acknowledged that <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> has met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on either visit in an apparent attempt to make it easier for the general to arrange a face-saving way out. Officials believe the more <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is seen to be under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to step down the less cooperative he will be. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the tentative deal was worked out during secret negotiations this week between the two. Administration officials have been anguished by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ability to hang on to power in the face of a severe cash-flow crisis that has meant no paychecks for thousands of Panamanian workers. Among other measures, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has frozen Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and cut off payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for services relating to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> operations. The administration also has continued to recognize the government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> even though he was ousted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters two months ago. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on drug charges in February by two grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have informed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> he will not be subject to extradition here if he agrees to seek political exile in a third country. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> conditional exile.

 A federal appeals court today invited the District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s highest court to consider whether gun manufacturers may be held liable in civil suits for deaths and injuries caused by cheap handguns. The advisory opinion was issued by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here about the dismissal of a civil suit against the manufacturer of the .22 - caliber pistol presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> used to shoot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in It invited the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which interprets local law in the nation's capital, to determine whether to adopt a 1985 finding by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s highest state court that gun manufacturers are liable for injuries and deaths caused by the criminal use of so-called Saturday Night Specials. The panel of three federal circuit judges found that the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> decision `` was based on public policy considerations'' expressed in that state's gun-control laws. `` The district's gun control statute ... places limitations on handgun ownership and purchases that are at least as strict as the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> provisions concerning handgun possession'' that formed the basis of the 1985 decision by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s highest court, the panel said. `` Such a reassessment is permissive, not mandatory'' by the local appellate court, the federal panel said. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s legislature recently voted to outlaw all cheap handguns, but that change in policy should not be a factor in the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> court's review of the issue, the federal panel said in an opinion written by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON>. The advisory opinion follows by a year a decision by the same appellate court upholding the dismissal of <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a defendant in civil suits filed by others wounded during <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s attack on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON>, which makes the guns through its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary R.G. Industries of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, had been sued for $ 20 million by White House press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON>. Both were wounded along with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> when <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on March 30, 1981. The shooting has left <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> confined to a wheelchair and <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON>'s wounds forced him to retire from the police force. A suit against <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> by the three men is scheduled to go to trial May 16 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Distict Court here. Two of the three judges in today's opinion, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, participated in last year's holding that gun manufacturers could not be held negligent for failing `` to prevent criminals from using their products.'' That decision also found that `` the strict liability claim fails because there is no allegation that the gun failed to operate properly. The gun was not defective.'' Because the 1987 opinion was not published by the court, it is not legal precedent. In a concurring opinion to today's ruling, <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> expressed regret that the court did not refer last year's issue for the same study by the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> said that if the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> holds gun manufacturers can be sued, the federal appellate court can reconsider whether to reinstate the suits by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON> against <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON>. The court said that a review of the liability standard was appropriate because the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was carved out of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and `` derived its common law from the state.'' The <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> decision, by a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, also involved a lawsuit against <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON>. The state's highest court said the manufacturer or marketer of a Saturday Night Special knows or ought to know `` that he is making or selling a product principally to be used in criminal activity.'' These guns are `` largely unfit'' for legitimate uses, the court found.

 Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have asked a judge to drop his order that temporarily blocks the school from prohibiting students who owe $ 300 or more in overdue fees from attending classes. University President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said Thursday the 10-day temporary restraining order obtained by students weakens the university's loan collection policy. <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said the order issued Wednesday by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> was unfair. He said neither school officials nor their attorneys were contacted to state their position before <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> issued his order. The university's policy kept students with overdue fees from attending classes and taking final exams, which begin next week. That sparked a week of protests, including demonstrations and a sit-in, at the predominantly black private institution, followed by the students' plea to the judge. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which directed the protests, have said school officials should have warned students earlier in the semester about the crackdown. University officials said the crackdown was prompted by abuse of an installment payment plan. They estimate some 2,000 students owe almost $ 1.5 million. <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said the order `` saddens me deeply and it jeopardizes the financial well-being of the university, including its undermining of the process that had resulted in significant payments of delinquent student fees.'' He said it is `` revealing and unfortunate'' that students who said they did n't have funds to pay their fees had gotten money to take the issue to court.

 If imitation is the highest form of flattery, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s annual book on `` Soviet Military Power'' is basking in compliments. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has issued its own version, `` Whence the Threat to Peace.'' And <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, a critic of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, this spring published what he calls `` an annotated and corrected'' version of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s propaganda document.'' Other military experts say that although the Pentagon book is not perfect, it is more accurate and comprehensive than either the Soviets' or <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>'s version. The latest edition, released by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> today at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news conference, addresses some of the criticism by including more information and tables comparing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact force levels, and acknowledging that the West leads in such areas as naval power and high technology. The latest, 175-page volume, which for the first time contains an index to weapons and photographs, reflects <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s desire for a more balanced and thorough approach. `` You'll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this year than in previous years. During my testimony -LRB- before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- earlier this year, I received a number of requests for an assessment of how Soviet military capabilities relate to our national interests, our military capabilities and those of our allies,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the news conference. `` Furthermore, I believe it is especially important to share with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and implications of Soviet military power as possible. And so this year the scope of the book has been expended ...'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` We welcome criticism.'' In September 1981, then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> released the first edition of the book in a presentation beamed by satellite to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The administration was waging a campaign for a $ 1 trillion military buildup to close the gap on what he called Soviet military superiority. Although <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> billed the glossy, 99-page booklet as a compendium of `` scrubbed'' intelligence reports on Soviet defense, analysts outside government called it a rehash of information already available in public. The glossy book contained colorful maps, charts, photographs and artists' renditions of Soviet weaponry. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> published a Russian-language version, which diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> circulated among Soviet contacts. The Kremlin was not pleased. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda published a lengthy front-page editorial describing the Pentagon book as a `` big lie'' designed for `` simpletons.'' `` It is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> propaganda,'' Pravda said on Oct. 17, 1981. By 1984, however, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> decided to weigh in with its own effort, `` Whence the Threat to Peace,'' drawing largely on Western publications to back Soviet claims that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the chief instigator of the arms race. In his version issued this spring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> author <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> was no less harsh than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> wrote that in the Pentagon version, `` even the most basic facts are distorted'' as part of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to prove that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on the losing end of a military gap. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>'s version includes the 1987 edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> book, overlaid with his own commentaries, for the most part corrections of the range and capabilities of Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weaponry. `` In almost every case, the Americans have taken the lowest estimate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capabilities and the highest for the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> said in his book and in a telephone interview. Military expert <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, too, plays with the numbers. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, he says, `` believes that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, no matter what it's flaws, is never as bad as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He looks for any figure that shows a Soviet weapon to be less capable.'' For example, <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> says that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is incorrect in saying that the new Soviet 2-S-7 203mm howitzer has a range of 18 miles, and that instead it has a range of 10.8 miles. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>'s figure is for a 203mm gun made in 1931, rather than the latest Soviet version <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> noted that some of the artist's renditions appear to be wildly inaccurate, a claim that <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> says is justified in part. An early edition of the book carried a purported drawing of the Soviet T-80 tank, but it looked more like the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> M-1, said both <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>. Some of the Pentagon figures have been contradicted in testimony by administration officials on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, or by other authoritative works, says <PERSON> Isby </PERSON>, author of `` Weapons and Tactics of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` But generally, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> does a good job,'' <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Condoleeza </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, an expert on the Soviet military and professor at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, shares <PERSON> Isby </PERSON>'s assessment of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> book. `` I find it pretty useful, although from time to time, you find errors,'' she said in an interview. `` I find <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> a lot less useful. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> agreed that although the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> book has improved over the years, it still lacks a workable comparison of individual Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons, or overall forces. That issue probably can not be answered authoritatively as long as the superpowers disagree over who is ahead in the arms race.

 A man linked to a left-wing Japanese terrorist group pleaded innocent today to weapons possession charges, 17 days after police found three pipe bombs in his car along the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have been investigating a possible link between the man, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 36, and a USO club bombing in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, that killed five people, including a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicewoman. Italian authorities have linked the bombing to the terrorist group. Italian authorities have confirmed that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was in their country in February. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knights </PERSON> said he could not comment on a continuing investigation. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has identified <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> as a suspected member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 36, was arrested April 12 at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> service area after police found three sophisticated homemade bombs and falsified papers in his car. At <LOCATION> Kikumura </LOCATION>'s arraignment, defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> questioned how <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s case was assigned to the court of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a judge <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>'s partner called the most conservative in the state. `` We were told it was rotation, but who knows?'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. `` We just want to see if it was n't maneuvered.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> denied the charges. `` I resent his accusations to the press yesterday that we calculated the judge to which it was assigned,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. `` There certainly was no effort to link the return of indictments.'' Kikumura pleaded innocent to all charges in the 12-count federal indictment, nine of which relate to the bombs and three stemming from alleged misuse of a visa and a passport. If convicted on all 12 counts, he could face 90 years in prison.

 As they waited for rescue, crewmen from the USS Bonefish refused to take a hovering helicopter's rescue line for themselves, passing it to their mates instead, a sailor from the ill-fated submarine said. `` They kept passing it feeling somebody would need it more than they. The first people we took were those who could n't swim well. Then we found we had some people who needed medical attention,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bellows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, the chief electrician's mate on the vessel <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> on Thursday said the crew members conducted an orderly evacuation of the ship through thick, poisonous smoke after a fire and explosions damaged the diesel-electric submarine. Three crewmen were killed in Sunday's accident while 22 others from the 92-man crew suffered smoke inhalation. Two remained hospitalized in satisfactory condition Thursday. The 219-foot Bonefish was involved in maneuvers off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at the time of the fire. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said the three dead men were were relatively new to the boat and may have been doomed by their unfamiliarity with its layout. Officials at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> fleet headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, say the first explosion took place in the submarine's forward battery compartment while the vessel was cruising at periscope depth. The batteries are used to power the sub when it is below the surface, and recharging them generates hydrogen gas, which can explode if allowed to accumulate. However, <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said a fire initially broke out in the crew living quarters but apparently could n't be contained. `` They had this small fire in berthing and a couple of people manned fire extinguishers and attempted to put it out,'' he said. Initial reports that the fire was under control were followed by reports it was spreading, he said. `` From everybody I talked to there was an explosion later, maybe five minutes down the road,'' he said. He said `` there's a lot of anger among the crew'' over speculation in the media that high levels of hydrogen in the battery compartments may have caused the explosions. `` I know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery well,'' he said. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Borton </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said today the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the sequence of fire and explosions aboard the Bonefish. Following the explosions, the Bonefish surfaced and its captain, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, ordered the crew evacuated to the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and frigate USS Carr, which were nearby. No one was available for comment on <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>'s account, an officer at fleet headquarters said Thursday night. Telephone calls to four spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend. The Bonefish was expected to arrive in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, its homeport, by early afternoon, said Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowery </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> prepared for a memorial service Saturday for the crewmen who died. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the remains of Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, had been removed from the vessel and flown to the <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Supporters today predicted swift House action on a bill allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to adhere to a century-old international copyright treaty and strengthen its hand against foreign piracy of records, tapes and computer technology. The measure was approved Thursday by a voice vote of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> without the so-called `` moral rights'' provision sought by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> film makers to help prevent unauthorized coloring and other alterations in works sold to television broadcasters. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chief sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, said the moral rights issue will be considered later in separate hearings by his Judiciary subcommittee, which considers copyright issues A similar measure, also without a moral rights provision, was approved April 14 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Approval of the legislation by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected within the next few weeks, congressional staff aides said. If the treaty is then ratified by a two-thirds majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would join 76 other nations that subscribe to the <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> Convention for the <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, which sets the world standard for copyright protection of creative works exported by any of the signatory nations. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> and other supporters of the bill said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adherence would help stem piracy of American-owned works in the computer and entertainment fields. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of records and tapes, for example, lost an estimated $ 558 million in sales in 1986 because of foreign counterfeiting and piracy, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to bring this to the full House for a vote right away,'' <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said today through a spokeswoman. `` Every day the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waits to join <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> is another day that the gold medalist of the world intellectual property Olympics stays on the bench for lack of proper credentials.'' <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said the bill would allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to improve copyright relations with 24 of the 76 subscribing nations. `` Joining the <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION> convention is a trade issue as well as an artistic concern,'' he said. `` ... We enhance our own political credibility in our global efforts to raise copyright standards and reduce piracy. The more we achieve in all those areas, the better we protect American jobs and American creativity.'' At a hearing before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on March 3, film makers <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> appealed for a statutory `` moral rights'' ban on changes in a motion picture by its financial backers or buyers without the consent of directors and screenwriters. `` American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors or film makers from having their life work distorted and their reputation distorted,'' said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who directed the hit movie `` Star Wars.''

 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appealed to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today to think about workers who lose their jobs when plants close, but Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed his comments, saying, `` He can talk about pink slips. I want to talk about competitiveness.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a breakfast with supporters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backing of trade legislation that includes a provision requiring that notice be given to workers before plant closings. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to veto the measure, which won congressional approval this week. The vice president said the fall election would give voters a clear choice between strong Republican leadership and `` old-fashioned liberal Democrats talking compassion and delivering misery.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said, `` I hope the president will take the time to think about the three million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers who lose their jobs in this country every year through plant shutdowns. In at least half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _ their own employees.'' `` These people are our neighbors,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` They deserve better from their employers. They deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, far behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but doggedly remaining in the race, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today on the issue of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, telling students at a high school in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> that both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should label <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state because of its backing of extremist rebels in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>.

 The government's chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity shot up 0.8 percent in March, pointing to continued growth for the rest of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. That, combined with a revised 1.3 percent growth rate in February, gave he Index of Leading Economic Indicators its best back-to-back performance since the last two months of 1986, when growth rates of 0.8 percent and 2.2 percent were recorded. February's rate had previously been reported as a much smaller 0.9 percent. The strength represented a remarkable turnaround in a forecasting gauge that at one point after the October stock market collapse was sending out signals of an impending recession. When the December index numbe was first released, it marked the third consecutive monthly decline in the index, the traditional but not infallible warning of a recession. But the initial calculations are subject to substantial revisions even months afterward. With today's revision, the only declines recorded since the stock market crash were a 1.2 percent drop in November and a 0.7 percent fall in January. Analysts said the big gains in the past two months reflected the surprising strength the economy has shown so far this year, good news for Republicans hoping to retain the White House. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said, `` The size and broad-based nature of the March increase in the leading indicators are significant and good news. They suggest that the economy remains on a steady course and that a healthy climate for prosperity will continue.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` the leading index suggests the economy will be headed onward and upward as we move through the second half of the year. From the point of view of the administration, the news on the economy could hardly be better.'' Sales of new homes posted a 4 percent gain in March, rising to an annual rate of 655,000 units, following an even better 14.1 percent jump in February sales. Analysts said the back-to-back gains showed that the housing industry has shaken off the jitters which sent sales down for several months following the October stock market collapse. In other good economic news, the government reported Tuesday that the gross national product grew at a moderate 2.3 percent annual rate from January though March, far above the declining GNP which had been feared immediately following the 508-point drop in the stock market on Oct. 19. The February and March increases in the leading index were likely to fuel growing fears, however, that the economy is expanding too rapidly and threatening to rekindle inflation. Interest rates have been rising in recent days, pushed higher by investor fears that the economic strength will soon prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten up on credit conditions as a way of slowing economic activity. The March increase in the index reflected widespread strength as six of the nine individual indicators showed gains. The biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices followed by a drop in weekly unemployment claims. On Thursday, the government reported that weekly unemployment claims fell to the lowest level since December 1973, prompting speculation that the unemployment report for April, which will be released next Friday, will show a further decline to 5.5 percent, down from the current nine-year low of 5.6 percent. Other indicators which showed strenth in March were a slowdown in business delivery times, indicating rising demand, a rise in building permits, faster growth in the nation's money supply and a rise in raw materials prices, indicating higher demand. Three indicators held the index back. The biggest negative factor was a drop in the length of the average workweek, a drop in plant and equipment orders and a decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967 base of 100. After the GNP report was issued, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said it showed the administration's 2.9 percent GNP forecast for the year was right on track He disputed contentions that a big jump in consumer demand, which had provided much of the first quarter strength in the GNP, raised any dangers of inflation. But private economists noted that prices at both the retail and wholesale level took a big leap up in March and that those factors, combined with the strong consumer demand, were prompting fears in financial markets. `` If you get growth too fast, then interest rates start going up. The credit markets are now prepared for higher inflation because of the faster growth,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said he expected economic growth would slow slightly in the current spring quarter, helping to quiet fears of an over-heating economy. But he said the economy would begin expanding at about a 3 percent annual rate in the second half of the year.

 New home sales increased in March for the second consecutive month, the government said Friday, providing new confirmation that the housing industry has shaken off its stock market crash jitters. The 4 percent rise in March, on top of an even stronger 14.1 percent jump in February, pushed sales to the highest levels since August, according to a joint release of the departments of Housing and Urban Development, and Commerce. However, the pace was still 9 percent below last year. Analysts predicted this healthy, but modest, sales level would continue into summer, but said rising mortgage interest rates threaten to choke off growth in the second half of the year. New single-family homes were sold at a seasonally-adjusted rate of 655,000 units last month, up from the month-earlier sales pace of 630,000 units. Sales had dropped 5.8 percent in January, 6.2 percent in December and 4.3 percent in November, raising fears that weakness in housing could spread to other sectors of the economy and help push the country into a recession. `` I am pleased to see we are picking up the pace,''' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I doubt that we will see much further pickup.'' Rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which had risen above 11.5 percent just before the Oct. 19 stock market crash, dipped below 10 percent in February and March. But, they have since edged up to 10.3 percent. In the short term, rising rates may actually help sales, said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, because `` buyers will realize rates have bottomed out and will want to lock in a rate before they go up higher.'' However, analysts expect rates to be approaching pre-crash levels by the end of the year and said that could dampen housing activity. New home sales this year are following a pattern established by sales of existing homes and construction starts of new homes. Both earlier reports indicated housing is recovering from low winter levels. Sales of existing homes increased 2.5 percent in March after an identical increase in February, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction of single-family homes jumped 7.1 percent in March after a 8.9 percent increase in the previous month. The March increase in new home sales was accompanied by a sharp decline in prices. The median, or mid-point, price of new homes was $ 101,100 in March, down 8.1 percent from February, which in turn was 6.8 percent lower than the January record of $ 118,000. The average price of a new home fell 5.4 percent to $ 130,300 in March, after a 4.9 percent decline in February. The March rise in sales was propelled by a 23.6 percent increase in sales in the West and a 8.4 percent climb in the South. Sales were down 18.9 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and dropped 12.5 percent in the Northeast. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the realtors group, said price averages are falling because housing activity is stronger in regions where prices are lower. Also, he said lower-priced homes, such as those purchased by first-time buyers, are selling more briskly than home in the upper brackets.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior aides apparently got the message when Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told them he will not tolerate attempts to undermine Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the president's spokesman said today. An administration source said earlier that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told subordinates Thursday he had `` had it'' with a spate of news stories about underground efforts to win <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ouster. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reminded aides that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeatedly stated his confidence in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and told them `` those people who disagree with that should come to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and talk,'' said the source, speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly.

Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did not believe anybody had been in to see <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as a result of his comments. `` I do n't think anybody missed the message,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` They'd be too dumb to work at the White house if they did.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reminded aides that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeatedly stated his confidence in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and told them `` those people who disagree with that should come to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and talk,'' said the source, speaking on grounds he not be identified publicly.

He said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told aides that he, too, believes in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s innocence. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been examining <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a proposed $ 1 billion oil pipeline project Also under investigation are <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s meetings with regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone company executives at a time when he owned $ 14,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock In addition, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is looking into the $ 40,000-a-year job for the attorney general's wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, that is being funded by the foundation of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> family that has leased real estate to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The administration source said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was not directly challenged by anyone in the meeting. `` You should have seen all the heads at the table, nodding up and down, and probably someone at that table had been leaking stories,'' he said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s threat, said, `` Senator <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the senior staff that the president supports <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> supports <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and if anybody questions that policy, then they should n't. Asked whether <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a former senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, had suggested that those in disagreement might leave the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had said, `` Come see me if you have any problems.'' A spate of stories has appeared recently quoting unidentified administration and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the time has come for the resignation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. These people were quoted in the various accounts as saying that a group of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s close friends and advisers had taken part in an underground effort, supposedly with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support, to work for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s departure.

 <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s staging of `` Long Day's Journey Into Night'' is a smash with audiences and critics more than three decades after the play premiered on the same Stockholm stage. The revival of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s classic at the National Dramatic Theater earned what one critic called the best review he ever wrote. The play opened April 17 and is sold out through August. This triumph for <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>, who turns 70 on July 14, comes at a time the director describes as the twilight of his career. He has said he has made his last film. But his schedule is unusual for a man claiming to approach retirement. His modernized Swedish-language version of <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> won plaudits in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The play goes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in June. He also is preparing <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` A Winter's Tale,'' and an opera to open here in 1991. In November, he published a best-selling autobiography, `` Magic Lantern.'' But seldom in his 50-year career has the applause of his home critics been louder than for the <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> play. `` This is sensational. World theater, if anything,'' wrote <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorksten </PERSON>, drama critic of the <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>, in what he called his most enthusiastic review ever. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s handling of the play was `` full of human knowledge'' and marked by a `` sympathy and warmth unusual for him.'' `` Brilliant,'' headlined <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION>, which published three glowing reviews. It called <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> `` a brilliant editor'' for cutting an hour from the original script `` with nothing of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s essentials removed.'' The play stars <PERSON> Bibi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> launched on an international career in the 1950s and with whom he had a two-year affair 30 years ago. `` I have never experienced such box office pressure for a play like this. People are writing and calling from all over the country, even <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>,'' theater director <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Dramatic Theater, which celebrates its centennial this year, was given the rights to stage the world premiere of <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s unpublished plays after his death in 1953 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsson </PERSON>, the theater's librarian and an <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> scholar, said that according to the playwright's widow <PERSON> Carlotta </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> was pleased with the theater's handling of his early plays and their success on the Swedish stage. `` Long Day's Journey'' premiered on Feb. 10, 1956, and the play was such a hit that it entered theatrical legend here. It won the 1957 Pulitzer Prize for drama. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was absent from the revival's opening night 32 years later. He said later he was looking after his flu-stricken wife, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>, and did not want to draw attention from the actors. His associates said <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> also was suffering from a painful hip which plagued him through the rehearsals and was scheduled for an operation shortly after the premiere. But he received a special ovation when the ensemble bowed to an empty seat in the first row after their ninth curtain call. <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s movies, which he began making in the 1950s, won world acclaim for their brooding explorations of troubled relationships. Outraged by an charge of tax evasion which was later dropped, <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> lived in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for seven years, before returning home in 1982 to direct the film `` Fanny and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s 70th birthday is likely to be the subject of national celebrations. <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> magazine, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, published a 90-page English-language special edition in April with tributes from leading movie directors. `` Probably the greatest film artist, all things considered, since the invention of the motion picture camera,'' said <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>.

There has been no question of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement of his vice president, only the matter of when it would come. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had vowed to remain publicly neutral so long as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination was in contention.

 The definition of a dog has become a bone of contention in the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. Under a proposal approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday, wolves, coyotes and crossbreeds no longer can be considered dogs _ and that should make it easier for one county to deal with its budget woes.

 Government and rebel leaders began a second day of meetings today in a climate of mutual distrust, having made little apparent headway in talks on achieving a lasting peace.

Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> started the meeting by calling for a 30-day extention to the 60-day truce that ends June 1. The U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, rejected the proposal. Contra leaders arrived Thursday for a second three-day round of high-level meetings to work out details of the cease-fire agreement they signed with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government March 23 in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The two sides have agreed on little since signing the preliminary peace accord, which aims to end the 6 -LCB- - year-old war that has claimed more than 26,000 lives In a surprise move, the government announced Thursday that the Contras may receive immediate humanitarian aid if it is distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The Sapoa accord calls for humanitarian aid to be provided to the rebels only after they gather in seven mutually agreed cease-fire zones. `` It is an effort to ease the pacification process that restores peace and the possibility of national reconciliation,'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told journalists. Under the accords, the rebels were to have moved into the zones two weeks ago, but the two sides have been unable to define the security and operating conditions within the zones. Many Contra fighters have moved into the general areas of the zones over the last few weeks. But journalists traveling to the isolated regions said the combatants are wary of the pact. The Sandinista proposal calls on the Contras to lay down their arms, an issue not specifically mentioned in the Sapoa accords. `` We insist that first we should discuss and reach an agreement about the modus operandi'' within the zones, said Contra leader <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>. He said that to accept the government's proposal would be tantamount to surrender. The government says the laying down of arms is basic to the agreement _ but the Contras say they will do so only when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is on `` the irreversible road to democracy.'' The two sides met Thursday at the Camino Real Hotel near the airport. The Contras are isolated from contact with the general public, but are permitted to make brief forays to speak to waiting journalists at a nearby hotel. The Contras' first three days of high-level talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> began April 15 and netted nothing more than an agreement to meet again.

 Developers of a $ 41 million luxury hotel near <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> have agreed to expand their parking after affluent neighbors threatened to put a cork in the hotel's liquor permit application. Homeowners who do n't want party-goers' cars parked around their neighborhood will have their chance Tuesday at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on the hotel's liquor permit request. `` No parking! No booze!'' was the residents' rallying cry at a recent meeting. `` The neighborhood is going to get nothing but more problems out of this hotel,'' said <PERSON> Harald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, president of a homeowners group near the 11-story, 311-room Ma <ORGANIZATION> Maison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sofitel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> being built on <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> across from the posh Beverly Center shopping mall. The scheduled summer opening of the hotel will mark the return of restaurateur <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrail </PERSON>'s trendy Ma Maison eatery, which closed on Melrose Avenue in 1985. Although the hotel's 328-space garage provides the legal minimum number of slots, it should be bigger because any overflow will spill onto already crowded streets, said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly-Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The hotel's developers have agreed to lease several dozen spaces at a nearby bank for nighttime and weekend use and to squeeze 382 cars into the garage by allowing valet parking only. `` We sympathize with what they want: to preserve their life style and the neighborhood,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON>, president of the firm developing the hotel. `` But at the same time we did n't throw $ 40 million into a hole in the ground to have a dry hotel.''

<HEAD>Partisan Squabbling Derails Sanctions Bill in House Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Efforts by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to advance a sweeping South African sanctions bill were derailed Friday when partisan squabbling broke out in the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the measure became entangled with a separate bill on <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The legislation would cut off virtually all economic relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> within a year. It is seen by supporters as building upon the limited sanctions imposed two years ago to force <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to moderate its apartheid policy, which deprives majority blacks of political and civil rights. But the measure is opposed by business interests as too harsh to have its intended effect, and many Republicans who supported limited sanctions in 1986 have said they will fight the Democrats this time. Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had planned to begin work on the sanctions bill Friday He was forced to postpone his panel's meeting until next week, however, after the measure became entangled in a dispute about a separate, Republican-sponsored bill to condemn the Marxist government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. `` I guess it reflects some of the rising political tensions'' of this election year, said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., a senior committee member Republicans were holding up the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sanctions bill as leverage to first force action on the Ethiopian measure. That bill urges President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to cut off imports of Ethiopian coffee and deny trade preferences if the Soviet-aligned government continues to impede relief efforts for starving people in its northern provinces. Ethiopian President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> on April 6 ordered foreign relief workers out of the provinces of <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, where his forces are at war with secessionist rebels. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> has been accused of trying to starve his own people into submission, and more than 2 million people are reported to be at risk of starvation. The <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> sanctions measure, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., was to have been acted on Friday before the committee turned to consideration of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sanctions bill But Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, D-Wash., objected, saying the measure was poorly written and was being rushed through without proper referral to the trade subcommittee, which he heads As the committee's meeting hit impasse and broke up, Republicans cried foul. `` It's a sad mark of politics and procedure,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. `` We've got millions of people starving to death.'' He accused <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON>, who is running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in his forestry-oriented state, of trying to use the situation to advance a pet bill imposing restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> had told reporters that bill might come before the full <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this week, but that did not happen. <PERSON> Bonker </PERSON> denied any connection between the two bills. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, R-Ind., said he would continue to use House rules to block consideration of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> bill until the Democratic-controlled committee acts on <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> sanctions `` The Ethiopian bill is much more significant at this point that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said. But one Democrat said the Republicans were merely using every tactic they could to delay further action on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which Democrats see as a potent political issue in their favor. `` When you're looking to sidetrack an issue, your best bet is to light forest fires all around the place,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` It's a testy time.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police are among the more restrained in the nation in using their guns, experts say, contrary to a common perception reinforced by this week's killings of an unarmed woman and a veteran police officer. `` Many people say ... ` They're killing people left and right,' but that's directly counter to the figures,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reppetto </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police commander who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, a watchdog group. Tighter guidelines for the use of deadly force began developing after a federal study found that police shootings helped spark 13 riots in the 1960s, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> policeman who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, Law and Society. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was really at the forefront in terms of the degree of the restrictiveness of the policy, and remains the most restrained among the large police departments in terms of shooting,'' <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON> said. None of which consoles <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, whose 31-year-old wife, <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON>, was killed early Wednesday in a hail of police bullets after a car chase that began when she ran a red light. `` She was defenseless. They surrounded her. It was coldblooded murder,'' said <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. Police said afterward that a sergeant had fired three shots at the car's tires. Because of a police radio report that shots were fired, officers who converged on the scene may have thought the woman fired the shots and was armed, police said. No weapon was found in her car. The same day, a veteran officer was shot during a drug raid. The fatal bullet came from another officer's gun _ not the gun of a woman arrested in the raid, as police originally reported. Asked if firearms policy would be changed in the aftermath of the two shootings, Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> responded, `` We are constantly reviewing our policy.'' The sergeant who shot out Mrs. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>'s tires apparently violated a 1985 department regulation against firing shots at a moving vehicle. The sergeant was suspended. Virtually all major police departments have similar rules, experts said. A 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling said deadly physical force may not be used to stop a fleeing felon. <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON>, who researched police shootings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for his doctoral thesis, found that a restrictive policy instituted in 1972 led to a sharp drop in the number of fatal police shootings, which reached 87 in 1971. From 1981 through 1984, the average was 33; in the past three years, it was 15, according to police figures. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> studied police shootings in the 57 largest cities from 1975 through 1983. <PERSON> Fyfe </PERSON> said that in terms of the number of fatal shootings per 1,000 officers, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had a relatively low rate of 1.36. The highest rates were <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, at 7.17, followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> at 6.8 and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 6.1. At the lower end of the scale were <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 1.19; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, 1.4; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, 1.62; and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, 1.71. In other major cities, the rate in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> was 4.32; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, 4.73; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 3.05; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 3.33; and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, 3.28. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trojanowicz </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that in the past 15 to 20 years, fatal shootings by police have declined `` because they're getting extensive training, and policies are becoming increasingly refined, specific and restrictive.'' `` In the past,'' he said, `` a person was given a weapon, put on the street and expected to literally learn on the job.'' Internal investigations and pressure from citizens make it `` very difficult with current procedures to cover up an errant police officer's actions,'' <PERSON> Trojanowicz </PERSON> said.

 Tens of thousands of Christians, some huddled beneath blankets and umbrellas, gathered on the Mall today for a day of prayer for their churches and their country. Evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> told the crowd this afternoon how he had been cured of tuberculosis 53 years ago by `` a man of God.'' `` The man of God laid hands on me in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' name and said, ` You foul disease, I command you in the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, you come out of this boy.' And brothers and sisters, it was resurrection, it was divine intervention,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said to a cheering audience. `` I stand here today, 53 years later, with my lungs sound and whole, my body healed by the power of God.'' Earlier, the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Derstine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, one of the first speakers at the `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'' rally, spoke of Christians repenting for the sins of the nation. `` I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. We feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we believe abortion still is an issue,'' <PERSON> Derstine </PERSON> said. Organizers said the rally attracted people from all 50 states and from more than 100 countries. Members of many Christian denominations were present; most of those in attendance were evangelicals. Sponsors said they expected 350,000 people would brave the rain and cool weather to join in the continuous, dawn-to-dusk prayers and songs. At noon, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who would not give her name, said the crowd numbered about 80,000. A similar rally in 1980 drew an estimated 200,000 people. When the rally ends, seven days of around-the-clock prayers will begin on the site of the rally. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Robidoux </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said he took the day off from work to attend because he felt it would be `` very uplifting to see this many people all doing the same thing.'' `` I believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> thinks Christians are divided against one another,'' <PERSON> Robidoux </PERSON> said. `` We're here to show we can stand together.'' <PERSON> Dae </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said she traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, because `` I just wanted to add my voice to those of many others. Before the rally began, the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said participants `` are going to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to pray. We're not going there to condemn. We're not going to denounce. We're going there to point the finger at ourselves.'' Indeed, organizers adi the sex-and-money scandals that have rocked television evangelism gave added impetus to today's rally. The rally's aim, <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said at a news conference Thursday, is to show repentance `` so we can be more effective,'' to reconcile differences within the church and between races and neighborhoods and to `` restore the church to holiness.'' `` When we started organizing this, there were no publicized scandals in the church,'' <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said of the sex-and-money troubles that brought down television evangelists <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` The scandals just emphasize the need for we who are Christians to come together.'' Today's rally was intended to be non-political, and that's why none of the presidential contenders was invited to speak, <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who is seeking the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president, was one of the key speakers at the rally eight years ago but was not invited to speak this time, <PERSON> Gimenez </PERSON> said. An exception for political figures was made for a videotaped message from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Although the rally was dedicated to reviving old-fashioned Christian values, it relied on the latest in technology to get its message across. Four huge screens, similar to those in baseball parks, were set up to show the activities on stage and messages like those from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggers </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he was impressed by the rally organizers' determination to help the residents of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I'm usually against groups that come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a day and leave us with our problems,'' Staggers said. Organizers asked each of the participants to bring a can of food for the poor and the homeless, and they agreed to help Washington-area churches set up drug treatment centers.

 Two teachers are being questioned and three classes have been canceled at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northridge </ORGANIZATION> campus after students reported being offered top grades for selling raffle tickets, officials said Students reported that the three independent studies courses in African history and culture also required no classroom attendance and assigned no course work, said campus spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>. University Vice President of Academic Affairs <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> announced Thursday that the classes had been canceled and the school's campus police had launched an investigation. `` Because we have been informed that there was no syllabus for this class and that most students never met with their instructors, it appears to me that grades were offered in exchange for activities not directly related to an officially approved course of study,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said. The university is also considering disciplinary action against two teachers and may turn over the findings of its investigation to the district attorney's office, Ms. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said. She said interviews with 30 students enrolled in the courses led to the probe. The two teachers being investigated were <PERSON> Eleazu </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON>, a 17-year faculty member, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON>, a first-year lecturer, campus officials said. The raffle tickets were allegedly being sold on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit, charitable organization founded by <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON>. `` I have done nothing wrong,'' the Nigerian-born Obinna, 54, said Thursday. `` I believe this is something concocted by the administration, not from complaints by students.'' <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON> said he required 45 hours of course work and graded students on their participation in minority community affairs. <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> declined comment. Student <PERSON> Laural </PERSON> <PERSON> Isles </PERSON>, 18, said <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON> told her to sell 20 tickets at $ 5 each for an A grade in his class. `` I personally did n't know who was even in charge of the class,'' said <PERSON> Trey </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, 18, another student in <LOCATION> Obinna </LOCATION>'s class. `` My understanding was that the proceeds were going to charity and the grade was contingent on how much we sold.'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s statement said the university also was looking into the legal status of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Obinna </PERSON> said the organization has sponsored summer youth job programs and holiday meals for the homeless He said it recently lost its non-profit status, but he renewed it with the state Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been pursuing an `` enormously expensive'' program of constructing huge underground bunkers and subways to protect its leaders and allow them to fight a protracted nuclear war, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Friday. While the existence of such complexes has been known for years, `` only recently have we been able to do the full analysis of the enormous extent of this program _ hundreds of meters deep, with subways under several cities,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> added. `` To have something comparable, we'd have to have facilities where we could put every governor, mayor, every Cabinet official and our whole command structure underground with subways running here and there. There's just no comparison -LRB- with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shelters built in the 1950s -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> highlighted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s so-called passive defense program as he released the 1988 version of `` Soviet Military Power,'' an unclassified study of what the Russian military has been doing over the past year. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary cited the underground work as just one example of how Soviet actions paint a different picture than the public statements of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, with his emphasis on arms control initiatives and improving the economy. Without elaborating, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also made it clear the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was developing a means of threatening the undergroud bunkers. `` Although the -LRB- Soviet -RRB- program strikes at the very basis of deterrence, we have a number of initiatives underway that will provide us an effective response to this program at a fraction of the cost that it must have taken the Soviets to undertake it,'' he said. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials acknowledged work had begun on a new family of `` earth-penetrating'' nuclear warheads for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles. `` There can be only one purpose for these shelters _ to provide the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership the ability to fight a protracted, nuclear conflict,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> declared. `` These facilities contradict in steel and concrete Soviet protestations that they share President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s view that nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought.'' The 1988 review, the last to be prepared by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, is the seventh such assessment of Soviet forces. This year's 175-page glossy publication differs substantially from the earlier reports, though, in that it tries harder to gauge who's leading whom in various technologies and regions of the world The report does still focus on some new weapon developments, though. Among them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ The Soviets will soon deploy operational units of their new Blackjack long-range bomber Deployment of the new rail-mounted SS-24 nuclear missile has begun, and production should start soon for a more accurate version of the huge SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missile. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the deployment of the SS-24 was significant, because it means the Soviets now have two operational <ORGANIZATION> ICBM </ORGANIZATION>'s that are mobile `` while we're still arguing in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about whether we should have one ...'' _ Two new attack helicopters, the Havoc and Hokum, `` are expected to enter serial production soon,'' and the Soviets have begun fielding `` a new tank derived from the T-72, exhibiting improved protection, better mobility and ehnahcned firepower. _ `` The Soviets are on the verge of deploying a variety of sophisticated cruise missile systems,'' and continue to lead the West in the pace of their activities in outer space. _ In the area of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviets _ like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ are unlikely to develop small `` kinetic kill'' rockets that could be placed in space to shoot down nuclear missiles at long range The Soviets could, however, `` deploy a short-range, space-based system for space station defense or close-in attack by a maneuvering satellite in the near future.'' In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the Soviets continue to improve their already large advantage in conventional weapons and troops. But the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is strong enough to deter attack primarily because the Soviets believe the Western allies would resort to nuclear weapons if in danger of being overrun, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. That ability to deter an attack may depend, however, upon success in developing new types of conventional weapons `` and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s current technological lead is threatened by an extensive Soviet commitment to surpass the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies.'' The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in a response written by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakovsky </PERSON>, criticized the administration Friday for continuing to publish the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> review. `` The stirring up of the myth about the Soviet military menace is a traditional method of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics, particularly at a time when the budget is being drafted,'' <PERSON> Polyakovsky </PERSON> said. `` Such a publication can do nothing but harm to Soviet-American relations.''

 Israeli troops on Friday raided two villages in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to interrogate residents about guerrilla attacks, and Moslem worshipers protested on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s sacred <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> and chanted, `` Jews leave!'' The protest came after underground leaders of the Arab uprising called for marches and symbolic funerals on Friday, the Moslem sabbath, to honor 175 Palestinians killed in five months of unrest in the occupied territories. In a new underground leaflet, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders called for more commercial strikes and protests against the Israeli occupation. But the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> remained mostly quiet on the Sabbath, the second during the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, two militiamen from the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed when their vehicle ran over a land mine on a side road in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone,'' which stretches from six to 10 miles north of the border, the army command said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said troops entered the villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rachaiya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Foukhar </LOCATION>, respectively four and six miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, to interrogate dozens of residents about two guerrilla infiltrations into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Tuesday and Wednesday. Two Israeli soldiers and five Palestinian guerrillas were killed in clashes following the infiltrations. Security sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said the troops, aided by their Lebanese militia allies, focused the searches on the rocky terrain east of where the guerrillas infiltrated. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were told five Lebanese villagers had been detained. The military command would not comment on the report. Military officials have linked the recent guerrilla raids to the 5-month-old uprising in the occupied lands and said they expect more raids aimed at supporting the protesters. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, several hundred Moslem worshipers emerged from noon prayers on the sacred <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> waving outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanting: `` Jews leave! The prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s army is coming.'' A police helicopter hovered above. Another chant glorified <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military leader who was gunned down April 16 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Israeli sources have implicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the killing but the government has refused comment. Military police, who were stationed on nearby rooftops, did not intervene and the protest dispersed peacefully. Inside the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque, a Moslem prayer leader called on Arabs to `` attack the enemies, attack the non-believers.'' `` More martyrs for God and the homeland!'' Sheikh <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siam </PERSON> told about 7,000 worshipers. `` Our only weapon is Islam. Millions of eyes are watching us.'' In the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> shopkeepers opened their stores promptly at 2 p.m., the hour that underground <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have instructed shops to open during <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. Israeli police, trying to thwart the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> instructions, have tried forcing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> merchants to open all day or preventing them from opening at all. Fourteen shopowners are awaiting trial for violating army orders to open. They could receive two-year jail terms. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, small disturbances were reported following noon prayers in several areas. Initial reports said there were no injuries. The latest underground leaflet, signed as usual by the `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION>,'' called on Arabs to practice civil disobedience and form self-governing bodies to replace Israeli-appointed Arab officials. `` The road to civil disobedience lies through the formation of more local committees,'' the leaflet said. It called on Palestinians to strike `` the severest blows'' at Arab officials viewed as collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The leaflet also called for more commercial strikes, days of tribute to victims of the uprising and `` days of Palestinian anger.'' This week's relative calm in the territories led Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to proclaim that the `` intefadah'' _ Arabic for uprising _ was fading. But an unidentified defense official was quoted in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> Friday as saying the army did not expect the uprising to die out soon. `` Despite the enormous pressures we have been putting on the inhabitants of the territories, despite the unprecedented mass arrests and despite the death toll ... the inhabitants still feel the uprising is on,'' the official was quoted as saying. `` And what matters more than anything else is their own feelings about it.''

 A mysterious explosion ripped open an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet `` like a convertible'' at 24,000 feet, injuring 60 people and throwing or blowing a flight attendant to her death before the pilot landed safely. `` There was big bang when it happened and everybody looked up and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, with one of its two engines aflame and about 15 to 20 feet of its cabin exposed behind the cockpit and down to the level of the passenger seats, flew for 25 miles after the blast and made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 2 p.m. Thursday -LRB- 8 p.m. EDT -RRB-, airline officials said. The cause of the blast on Aloha Flight 243 was unknown Thursday night, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimatsu </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was sending investigators to the scene and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were sent from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to determine whether the blast was caused by a bomb, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heafner </PERSON>. However, sources close to the federal investigation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said investigators were focusing most heavily on a possible structural failure that may have been caused by a rapid decompression and that the force of strong wind at 24,000 feet may then have ripped away the huge section of fuselage. The sources spoke on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> area coordinator for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said today he could not confirm whether federal investigators suspected that a structural failure caused the fuselage to tear away from the airplane. `` It stands to reason that they're checking everything _ structure failure, explosive devices,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators will hold their first news conference later today, he said. Another passenger, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said she put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees. `` I sang all the hymns I knew,'' she said. `` That kept me busy.'' `` Everybody screamed,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` However, it was very brief _ the panic. ... The rest of the plane was intact, and we did not go into any unusual attitudes or anything like that. I think that people realized the plane was still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing whatever they could do to save their lives.'' Passenger <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Westfall </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the plane `` jerked around, up and down.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberly </PERSON>, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. `` I saw hair flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said after the plane came to a stop on the ground, he saw `` some really mangled people,'' including one with an arm almost severed. `` It looked like a normal landing with the whole top of the plane gone,'' he said. `` It looked like a convertible,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronderos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It was like somebody had peeled off a layer of skin. You could just see all the passengers sitting there,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, area coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, the primary subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said there were no fuel lines or other potential sources for an explosion in that part of the plane. `` The fuel is in the wing, the engines are in the wing and the fuel lines are all right there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` I think this is a very unusual circumstance that is not related to any other accidents we have had.'' Even in the extremely unlikely event that a turbine blade tore loose from an engine and ripped into the fuselage, it could not hit forward from the wing, and the effect would be nothing like what happened to the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plane, he said. The plane was one of nine 737-200s delivered to <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> in the late 1970s, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>. The first 737-200 was put into service in April 1968. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, said nothing is stored in the area of the the blast. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> cited the `` extraordinary performance'' of pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> in bringing the 737-200 in safely. Schornstheimer has flown for the airline for 12 years. `` I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>. `` I've had worse landings in normal aircraft,'' <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> said. Sixty people were taken to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and 12 were admitted, two in critical condition and four serious, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, emergency room director. Injuries included burns, bruises and cuts, he said. The missing flight attendant, identified as <PERSON> Clarabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, was probably either ejected by the blast or blown out of the plane by the wind, said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Hue </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> area manager. `` I think the stewardess -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> -RRB- had just picked up the microphone to start talking'' when the explosion occurred, <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> said some of the passengers hung on to another standing flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the plane, and they praised the cabin crew for helping calm the passengers. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> mounted a search that included a cutter, a C-130 search and rescue aircraft and two helicopters, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Petty Officer <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawley </PERSON>. However, searchers found no trace of Mrs. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, a 37-year employee of the airline, or the missing section of the plane, he said. The explosion occurred southeast of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> while the plane was at an altitude of 24,000 feet, the airline said. It said the 110-mile flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> carried 89 passengers, five crew members and an air traffic controller from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student was arrested Friday in connection with an incident last month in which a woman was repeatedly raped and left unconscious at a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternity house, authorities said. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON>, 19, of the <PERSON> Albama </PERSON> school's Pi Kappa Alpha chapter, was charged with one count of accessory to a felony and one count of failure to report a sexual battery, said <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Handley </PERSON>. `` The warrants charged <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON> with having helped carry an unconscious sexual battery victim from the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and leaving her in the hallway of the Theta Chi fraternity house,'' said <PERSON> Handley </PERSON>. <PERSON> McPharlin </PERSON> was to be booked into the <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail under a $ 6,000 bond. Meanwhile, a three-member <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> met for the third day to discuss what punishment will be handed out to the fraternity, two of whose members were charged earlier this week with raping and brutalizing the 18-year-old woman. The fraternity was suspended April 22 pending the hearing. An interim grand jury report issued last week said the victim was raped by more than one person and was found at the Theta Chi fraternity early March 5 `` intoxicated to a life-threatening degree.'' She suffered multiple scratches and abrasions, had crude words and a fraternity symbol written on her thighs and had a .35 percent blood-alcohol level, more than three times the legal limit for driving. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oltarsh </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, both <ORGANIZATION> Pi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, were freed on $ 10,000 bond Wednesday after being charged with sexual battery in the case. Each could face up to life in prison if convicted. University spokeswoman <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the committee considering permanent sanctions against the fraternity will pass on its recommendation to Dean of Students <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity at <ORGANIZATION> Stetson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> was suspended for a year following rape allegations. Stetson officials said there was not enough evidence to determine if there was probable cause for legal charges. The school suspended five students, including two seniors, and ordered 27 members to move out of their fraternity house because of sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse at a party.

<TEXT>
 A group that says treaties giving Indians special fishing and other rights are discriminatory has hit upon a novel fund-raising approach: It's selling beer. But critics say `` Treaty Beer'' is nothing but `` hate and prejudice in a can.'' Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, church groups and other critics on Thursday denounced plans to market the brew in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and called for a boycott. The first 2,500 cases of the beer are scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> next week. Profits are to be earmarked for challenges to Indian treaty rights. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, the group that created the beer, said his home state of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and perhaps 40 other states are having disputes over treaties giving Indians rights to fish, hunt game and use other natural resources. Treaty Beer was test-marketed in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and sold more than 70,000 cans in the first week, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said he expects a million cases _ 24 million cans _ to be sold every year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The headline on advertising being run in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> newspapers says `` Vote with your mouth.'' Some of the profits will be used to press for implementation of Initiative 456, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbaugh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillnetters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of commercial fishermen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state voters approved the initiative in 1984, calling for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to rescind old treaties that were interpreted by federal judges as guaranteeing Indian fishermen in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the right to half the fish in their usual and accustomed fishing grounds. In separate actions Thursday, the governor issued a denunciation and called for a boycott of the beer, and other critics staged a joint press conference in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` Treaty Beer is not welcome in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and I ask all citizens to join me in renouncing the effort to market it in our state,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. The governor said `` cooperation, not confrontation'' has finally been achieved in the wake of the court action as the state has developed peaceful, joint management of fisheries. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> added: `` There is very little the state can do to legally stop the sale of this product _ except to strongly discourage people to buy it.'' The <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> press conference featured comments from <LOCATION> Evans </LOCATION>, Indian rights activists, and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, the forest industry and environmentalists. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, vice chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, said he was `` saddened to think that outside agitators see our state as fertile ground for their message of hate.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, blasted the `` rascist mentality,'' and added, `` We recognize this brew for what it is: hate and prejudice in a can.'' In a separate press conference later, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arbaugh </PERSON> denied they were racist. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, who called himself an ardent sports fisherman, said his group thinks treaties that give special fishing rights to Indians are unfair to other fishermen. `` I do n't see it as a <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan issue,'' said <PERSON> Arbaugh </PERSON>. `` I do n't see it as an issue to deprive someone of something. ... I do n't understand why people try to point this out as a racist issue. Racism is when people get special rights.'' But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` an effort by anti-Indian extremists to violate treaties.'' He called the beer's promoters `` fringe-element radicals who consider Indian land and resources fair game to fill their own pockets.''

<HEAD>Report: State Falling Short of Quota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State corrections officials are consistently falling short of a self-imposed quota of releasing 3,000 inmates a month to ease prison crowding, according to a published report Friday. Despite record high parole approval rates, the quota system which began in September has hit its goal only one month during a six-month period, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> said. An examination of Board of Pardons and Paroles records showed that 3,083 inmates were paroled in October, the only month the parolee total exceeded the monthly quota. In September, 2,668 convicts were paroled, 2,057 were released in November, 2,441 in December, 2,241 in January and 2,422 in February. During the same six-month period, officials approved parole for inmates under consideration for the first time at a rate ranging from 59 percent in January to 80 percent last September. The rate for February, the most recent month for which figures were available, was 70 percent. The `` revolving-door'' plan was instituted last fall as a quick-fix to make room for the projected 36,000 new inmates in the coming year. The numbers represented an almost 100 percent criminal population turnover. The catch was that only so-called `` non-violent'' inmates _ serving time for passing bad checks, theft, credit-card abuse, drug possession and burglary _ would be eligible for early release under the plan. Parole officials have been predicting in recent months that the pool of eligible inmates in those categories soon would dry up, a situation that would force Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> to invoke a state law that allows an award of good-conduct credit to inmates. Parole board member <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mealy </PERSON> said the quota system may be on the verge of running its course. Mealy said he will push a plan next week in which parole officials could contract private concerns for vacant space to house parole violators.

<HEAD>Biochemical Basis For Baldness Found, Miami Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> researcher said Friday that baldness is caused by a biochemical change in cells that stop hair growth, but it will be five to 10 years before a possible cure is ready for testing. Dr. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said she and colleagues have determined that hair follicles that cease growing hair have a high ratio of a single-molecule protein that is able to carrying the male hormone testosterone into the cell nucleus and `` short circuit'' hair growth. Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> told a news conference at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> that the discovery was made after she was able to separate out cells from scalp plugs from men at different stages of hair loss. The physician said cells vigorously growing hair contain a high ratio of a protein she called a tetramer, which has four molecules closely bound together. But in scalp cells growing hair weakly or not at all, she said, the tetramer ratio is very low and a type of protein she called a monomer, or a single molecule of protein, was dominant. Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> said it appears the monomer is able to penetrate the nucleus of the hair cell and affect the genetic pattern of the cell that directs the growth of hair. The tetramer protein, however, is unable to enter the cell nucleus. Also, she said, the monomer is four times more able to bind with testosterone than is the tetramer. In other studies, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> research team was able to isolate an inhibitor protein that tends to block binding of the male hormone and the monomer, Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> said. This binding is thought to be an important step in the process that leads to a halt in hair growth. Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> said she now is attempting to purify and eventually synthesize this inhibitor protein. This protein possibly could be administered to men who are starting to go bald and thereby stop the process, she said. `` I would hope we could have something like that in the next five to 10 years,'' she said. `` There'll be nothing any sooner than that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> said her research group has found a way to change the protein ratios in the cells and that this technology might eventually be applied to assist in the permanent removal of unwanted hair, such as on the face of a woman. Dr. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a clinical professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, praised the work by Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON> as `` tremendously interesting. She has carried it -LRB- explanation of baldness -RRB- a little bit further. It is an important next step.'' Ms. <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said the research clearly shows how the balance of protein types changes in hair follicles as they become progressively shorter. Normal, hair-growing follicles are long and filled with a thick hair shaft. But follicles become progressively shorter and the hair shaft thinner as the protein ratio shifts. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a dermatology researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Sawaya </PERSON>'s work has been examined by a peer review group and found to be `` well founded.'' `` It is an important extension of our understanding of the local effects that cause male pattern baldness,'' he said. About 70 percent of all men over age 60 experience some form of male pattern baldness, and for many the hair loss starts in the 20s and 30s. Hair loss is also a problem with 10 percent to 15 percent of the adult female population. The <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> is a 50-year-old organization of scientists specializing in rersearch of skin disorders.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today he had tentatively decided to open debate May 11 on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to ban medium-range nuclear missiles, but only if the two superpowers could clear up differences on verification and other issues. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` to move forward expeditiously'' and said the treaty's anti-cheating provisions were effective. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the department spokesman, said the Soviets had taken a `` restrictive'' view of the right of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitors to inspect containers for missile components as well as access to Soviet facilities. He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had raised the issue with the Soviets at a senior diplomatic level and was waiting for a reply. `` So we will see what we get,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official called the Soviet interpretation of the verification procedures unacceptable. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> made clear that debate would not begin on May 11 _ less than three weeks before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ if areas of concern were still unresolved. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials are urging the legislators to approve the pact before the May 29-June 2 summit to enhance prospects for the two nations agreeing to other weapons restraints. The majority leader said he is especially concerned by published reports quoting ranking Soviet military leaders as appearing to be back away from mutual understandings on what would be permitted under treaty provisions allowing on-site verification inspection. s <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> called on both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to quickly deal with that question as well as others, including a treaty ambiguity on what constitutes a weapons delivery system and whether or not such `` Star Wars'' weapons as those using laser beams or particle ray generatiors are covered by the pact. Earlier, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control official said the embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been in touch with Soviet officials to resolve the differences they raised on how to verify compliance with the treaty. `` We anticipate that it'll be cleared up,'' the official of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` We do n't think this will be a big problem.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a closed session this week, voted sharp cuts in the budgets for intelligence agencies because of irritation at the administration's failure to seek improved surveillance systems for use in verifying the treaty, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., said in an interview that he is prepared to filibuster the treaty unless the White House requests the money the intelligence panel believes is needed for monitoring, the Times reported

 Panamanian exiles on Friday blasted a U.S.-sponsored deal that would allow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign as defense chief, calling the change purely cosmetic and one that could create an anti-American backlash. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, meanwhile, said drug indictments against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman remain in force. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, sources reported Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had agreed to step down from his powerful post as head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military, but would not leave his country immediately as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had initially demanded. The reports did not say whether dismissing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s cocaine-trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> was part of the deal, but such offers have reportedly been made in the past `` This sounds like a surrender with cosmetics,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>, exiled publisher of the closed independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the same mistake all over again _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervening in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, ignoring totally the political forces of the country.'' <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>, exile representative here of the Panamanian opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade, agreed. `` This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the road to disaster,'' said <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has no right to decide <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Mallol disputed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contentions that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power as soon as he is out of uniform. `` Obviously, this deal shows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is making conditions. He will continue to interfere and continue the militarization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON> warned that the deal could backfire on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, causing a wave of anti-American sentiment among <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents. <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> said the opposition will not let up because of the deal, noting the latest outbreak of anti-Noriega demonstrations Thursday. Hundreds of people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, burning barricades and chanting against the military leader. Both <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> agreed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> only if he agrees to submit to Panamanian justice. They also said the nation must move toward a true democracy and break the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s stranglehold on power. `` The problem is n't <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>, `` It's the military. If the militarization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not ended, what looks like a short-term solution will lose <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the long term.'' Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said it had not been notified of any change in the status of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment, which accuses him of accepting $ 4.6 million in bribes from the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION> to protect its cocaine-smuggling operations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He is also under indictment in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on separate drug charges. `` The only two people who can dismiss an indictment are the Attorney General of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for the district in which the indictment was brought,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, chief assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and lead prosecutor in the case. `` As far as we are concerned, no dismissal has been entered here.''

<HEAD>Arrest Of Underground Preacher Belies Relaxed Trend</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

 The apparent arrest of an underground Christian preacher comes during a time of unusual tolerance by the Communist government toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s illegal `` house churches.'' Another underground minister in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said authorities recently have not stopped him and other preachers from holding weekly services in their homes for dozens and even hundreds of people even though they violate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ban on preaching outside state-sanctioned churches. The minister, who spoke on condition of anonymity, painted a picture of an underground movement toughened by past harsh repression and confident it can survive any setbacks. `` I was in prison more than 20 years _ I'm experienced,'' the 74-year-old minister said grinning broadly. `` If I am arrested again and die for the Lord it is glorious.'' He and <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongzhe </PERSON>, who disappeared April 16 and is believed to have been arrested, are among thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> ministers and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests and nuns who refuse to join the official churches. Instead, they preach at home. About 8 million people belong to the official <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and nearly as many are believed to belong to the house churches. The believers make up a tiny fraction of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s more than 1 billion people. Although some house church preachers and members remain in prisons and labor camps _ the minister said there were 500 in custody _ the government is more tolerant of their activities than ever before in nearly four decades of Communist rule. The minister said authorities have not bothered him even though he remains under probation after being freed from jail in 1979, and holds two services each Sunday. Forty people crowd into his one-room home _ something impossible to hide from neighbors in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s tightly packed residential areas. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s arrest, however, was no surprise. He had been a fugitive since 1982, when he escaped from a jail in <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, hopped on a bicycle and peddled into hiding. He ran an underground seminary but was not especially prominent among house church preachers, his fellow minister said. Xu, believed to be about 50, had been in jail only a few months charged with illegal proselytizing. The other minister said he did not know <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s sentence. He said he'd been expecting <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> to visit the day he disappeared. Instead, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s sister came alone and reported that <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> disappeared while visiting the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo with two friends, the second day after he left his hiding place in northern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to hear visiting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preach in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s sister received no confirmation from authorities that he had been arrested, but it appeared certain. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> refused to answer queries about Xu. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at the end of his 16-day Chinese tour that he asked high-level Chinese officials about the reported arrest but received neither confirmation nor denial. The renowned Southern Baptist minister said he prayed for <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> and told Chinese officials his reaction to the report, but could not otherwise intervene. `` Our hope is from the Lord, not from <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>'s colleague said The minister said he studied theology under Western missionaries in the 1930s, but <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> and younger house preachers learned through self-study and informal training by house church preachers. Funds and thousands of Bibles are smuggled in each year from religious groups outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The minister said the house churches have no central organization and do not oppose the government. `` We have no time to mess with the things of the world,'' he said. `` I believe politics and religion should be separate. The -LRB- official -RRB- churches have become a tool of the government. They preach to ... serve the modernization policy.'' Indeed, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Catholic church does not recognize the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. During the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution all churches were closed and religious activity was banned. Although some churches have been reopened since <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> came to power in 1978, ministers and priests are closely circumscribed. They can not give religious instruction to anyone under 18, and must support government campaigns. Preaching on themes such as diligence, honesty and respect for parents is considered to have social value. But the Christian belief that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> will come again at the end of the world is discouraged as likely to undermine hard work. `` We are free _ but only inside the circle,'' the minister said, running a finger around the rim of a rice bowl in illustration.

 Thousands of people gathered for a march through downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today to support strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after reports that he had agreed to resign as defense chief. Many government offices closed at midmorning, and employees were told to join the march called by the <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said that under an agreement with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after resigning. Initially, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had insisted that he leave the country. `` It is they -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- that are now seeking a face-saving maneuver,'' said a Panamanian government official who spoke on condition he not be identified. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> this week and was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. There was no official comment here on the reported talks. Panamanian government officials have not confirmed that they were being held. As commander of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been the power behind the civilian government. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, once he steps down, would be like a `` cop out of uniform'' and would cease to be the dominant political force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The government official said he saw nothing new in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reports. On Thursday, security agents arrested at least 30 people in a crackdown on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents, and authorities issued arrest warrants for opposition leaders. Riot police and plainclothes officers fired birdshot into the air from 12-gauge shotguns and lobbed tear gas canisters to disperse small groups of protesters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Hundreds of demonstrators set up burning barricades and taunted police and riot troops, who patrolled in trucks. The protesters chanted, `` Get Out, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>!'' `` Justice!'' and, in a derogatory reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s pockmarked face, `` Down With Pineapple Face!'' Journalists saw police arrest several people in the city of <PERSON> David </PERSON> near the Costa Rican border. A church source in <PERSON> David </PERSON> said at least two people were wounded when demonstrators began throwing rocks at police. Police refused to comment on the reports. Before the demonstrations, Attorney General <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> told a news conference that the 30 people arrested were planning a three-day campaign of violence which he said may have included tampering with two <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> locks. <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON> said arrest warrants had been issued for 35 directors of the National Civic Crusade, an umbrella organization of civic and professional groups that has organized anti-Noriega protests since June. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> signaled a shift in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy Thursday when he said the administration, while not insisting that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, wants him at least to `` leave power.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted a source as saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would leave after a `` face-saving'' transition and was known to favor the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The agreement also provides that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would not be extradicted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug charges. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials reportedly have been seeking more subtle ways to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down after failing to dislodge the general with the economic sanctions, which have created a severe cash shortage in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> told a gathering of international labor organizers Thursday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will continue to resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> won a legal battle Thursday when a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> ruled he could challenge one of two drug-trafficking indictments without surrendering to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> gave the general's attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, 10 days to submit challenges to the Feb. 4 indictment and said he would set a hearing date after the government responded

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stepped up his attack on <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Friday, accusing him of being either ignorant or wrong about issues involving southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Specifically, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had expressed opposition to providing weapons to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist-led government for use against a rebel movement that is brutalizing the country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, `` either has a lack of understanding about the options in the region or he supports a policy that's inconsistent with the progressive and democratic thrust in the world.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made the comments to reporters following a speech to about 2,500 students at <ORGANIZATION> Euclid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where he received a cordial reception but one that was less enthusiastic than he usually gets at schools. He portrayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as being to the right of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, stating that even conservative <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sends arms to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>.

Throughout the campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made attempts to bring southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into the campaign debate, and he has been making a renewed and more intense push to do so as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead in the delegate race has widened. In the face of the growing likelihood that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be the Democratic nominee, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he wants to delineate the distinctions between himself and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, while also trying to focus attention on issues he considers important. The approach is in contrast to the posture <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> maintained through most of the campaign in which he avoided singling out Democratic opponents for criticism. Campaigning Friday in search of votes for Tuesday's <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> primary, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also repeated his charge that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has no plan to reverse <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration economic policies, but wants only `` to manage Reaganomics.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stance on <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> `` exposes a lack of understanding of foreign policy. ... The front line states -LRB- around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -RRB- need to be able to defend themselves from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> denies it supports the Mozambican rebel group, known as <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said there is evidence to the contrary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in recent days has called on Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely Republican presidential nominee, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to join him in calling for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be treated as a terrorist state because of its support for <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does not take much to class <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be a terrorist state,'' he said. `` If one does, however, you must then trigger anti-terrorist policies. We must then put on full trade and arms embargoes against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and engage our allies with whom we trade arms'' and insist they not sell arms to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. On Friday <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also addressed an outdoor rally under chilly, gray skies in downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. A few hundred people braved the wind and cold to attend. At the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> Euclid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s usual crowd-rousing `` I am somebody'' chant drew halfhearted audience participation. When the crowd weakly repeated the words after him, the candidate joked, `` You're all so pitiful.'' Eventually he warmed them up by shouting, `` Euclid _ No. one!'' But afterward, student <PERSON> Maren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lueersen </PERSON>, 17, said she felt his presentation was `` too much like church,'' with the students being asked to recite chants and stand when he asked how many people knew someone who was killed or jailed because of drugs.

 It's a boy, girl, girl, girl and girl for <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON>. The first-time parents said Friday they're `` five times happy'' with their quintuplets, born three months prematurely earlier this week. `` I think it's wonderful. You get a whole family at once,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON>, 26, said from a wheelchair after visiting her babies in the neonatal intensive care unit of <ORGANIZATION> Magee-Womens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't want to do this again, but it's worth it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON>, a registered nurse, learned she was expecting quintuplets about a month after she became pregnant last fall after taking a fertility drug. Even so, she and her husband are still not over the shock. `` You have to deal with this. This is what you have. This is what <PERSON> God </PERSON> has given you,'' said <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON>, 28, a buyer for a wholesale grocery company. The babies were delivered by Caesarean section during a five-minute span beginning just before midnight Wednesday. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> came first, followed by <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. After midnight, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> were born, giving them a birthday a day after their older siblings. The babies ranged from 1 pound, 8 ounces, to 1 pound, 10 ounces. They were listed in critical but stable condition Friday. `` We do feel they have a reasonable chance and at this point are optimistic,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, the hospital's chief of pediatrics. The next week will be the most crucial, he said. Quintuplets occur naturally once per 6 million to 7 million births, according to the hospital, but use of a fertility drug ups those odds. The only other set of quintuplets born at <LOCATION> Magee-Womens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, in 1966, all died within days of birth. During the pregnancy, the <PERSON> Simuniches </PERSON> did n't go on a buying spree or make major changes at their four-bedroom home in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, a small community in northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` We've tried as much as possible to keep a normal attitude about the things that we do from day to day,'' <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have a choice, and to worry about it just causes more anxiety.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON> was hospitalized about a month ago as a precaution and went into labor several times but was given a drug that stopped it. Wednesday night, doctors decided they could wait no longer, and a 33-member medical team delivered the babies by Caesarean section. The quintuplets are expected to remain in the hospital until late July. Mrs. <PERSON> Simunich </PERSON> said her career plans are up in the air but she hopes eventually to return to nursing part-time. In the meantime, she's going to go home and wait for the babies to join her. `` I'm going to sit on my deck and have a drink,'' she said, laughing.

<TEXT>
 The new defense secretary, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, on Friday put his own moderate stamp on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s annnual review `` Soviet Military Power.'' The book has generated a host of critics and at least two imitations since then-Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> issued the first edition in 1981, at the outset of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's $ 1 trillion defense buildup. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has its own version, `` Whence the Threat to Peace.'' And <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, a critic of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, this spring published what he calls `` an annotated and corrected'' version of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s propaganda document.'' Now austerity has put a crimp in the Pentagon budget, and time and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> have removed some of the book's more jagged edges. Early editions of `` Soviet Military Power'' drew criticism from many analysts on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and outside government because of alleged innaccuracies and failure to compare overall capabilities of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The 1988 edition released at a news conference on Friday, the first since <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> became replaced <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as defense secretary last Nov. 5, addresses those criticisms by including more comparative text and graphs. It also acknowledges that the West leads in such areas as naval power and high technology. The book has shed the warlike red cover of previous years in favor of calmer gray background and a photograph of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the deck of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Typhoon </LOCATION> nuclear ballistic missile submarine. Also, the publication devotes most of its first 30 pages to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s overall national security policy before turning to military spending and hardware. `` You'll note we have taken a somewhat different approach this year than in previous years,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters. `` During my testimony -LRB- before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- earlier this year, I received a number of requests for an assessment of how Soviet military capabilities relate to our national interests, our military capabilities and those of our allies,'' he said. `` Furthermore, I believe it is especially important to share with the public as comprehensive a view of the trends and implications of Soviet military power as possible. And so this year the scope of the book has been expanded ...'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` We welcome criticism.'' The latest 175-page volume is nearly double the 99 pages of the first edition, and for the first time contains an index to weapons and photographs. In 1981 <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, in a presentation beamed by satellite to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, issued the first edition together with a declaration that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was stronger militarily than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> billed the book as a compendium of `` scrubbed'' intelligence reports on Soviet defense, but analysts outside government called it a rehash of information already available publicly. It contained colorful maps, charts, photographs and artists' renditions of Soviet weaponry The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> published a Russian-language version, which diplomats in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> circulated among Soviet contacts. The Kremlin was not pleased. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda published a lengthy front-page editorial describing the Pentagon book as a `` big lie'' designed for `` simpletons.'' `` It is to be hoped that the foreign public will be able to judge the worth of the latest rotten fruit of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> propaganda,'' Pravda said on Oct. 17, 1981. A few years later, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> weighed in with its own effort, `` Whence the Threat to Peace,'' drawing largely on Western publications to back Soviet claims that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was the chief instigator of the arms race. In his version issued this spring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> author <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> was no less harsh than the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> wrote that in editions as recent as last year, `` even the most basic facts are distorted'' as part of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to prove that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on the losing end of a military gap. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>'s version includes the 1987 edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> book, overlaid with his own commentaries, in large part corrections of the range and capabilities of Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weaponry. `` In almost every case, the Americans have taken the lowest estimate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capabilities and the highest for the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON> said in his book and in a telephone interview. Military expert <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Isby </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, too, plays with the numbers. <PERSON> Gervasi </PERSON>, he said, `` believes that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, no matter what its flaws, is never as bad as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He looks for any figure that shows a Soviet weapon to be less capable.''

<HEAD>Dukakis' Plant Closing Law Doesn't Apply in Possible Cullinet
Layoff</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A Massachusetts-based company reported to be planning major layoffs has failed to notify the state at a time when Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been touting a state law on the subject. A state official says the law would n't apply in the case. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign a federal trade bill that requires companies to warn workers 60 days before a major layoff or plant shutdown. He has emphasized that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> was one of the first states to impose its own plant-closing law. The issue has been of particular importance to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as he campaigns in industrial sections of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, which have primaries Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration officials said it was only this week that they saw press reports that <ORGANIZATION> Cullinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> planned to lay off 400 of its 2,400 workers Monday and that half the layoffs would occur at the company's <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, plant. Cullinet spokeswoman <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> termed reports of the layoffs `` rumors.'' She said she was familiar with the state plant-closing law, but `` we do n't have any set, bound company policy about notifying.'' `` Of course we would always prefer advance warning,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gureghian </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Executive Office of Economic and Manpower Affairs. However, unlike the federal proposal, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requests but does not require companies to provide advance warning of plant closings. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defends it as effective and says there are sanctions to make companies comply. `` In many ways,'' he said of the state's law, `` it goes beyond this -LRB- federal proposal -RRB- and in other ways it does n't.'' <PERSON> Gureghian </PERSON> said the state defines a plant closing as laying off 90 percent of the work force at a plant. A `` partial closing,'' <PERSON> Gureghian </PERSON> said, is `` a permanent cessation of a major, discreet portion'' of a company or division. The reported plans for Cullinet layoffs would not apply to either definition, he said.

 The biggest burger maker in the free world wants to find out if it can cut the mustard in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but only after it goes <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it will open the first of a string of eateries in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next year. It may not mean golden arches in Red Square, but it will mean Muscovites can munch fries, slurp shakes and gobble `` Big Maks'' just like their Western counterparts, courtesy of McGlasnost. `` I think the McDonald's in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will be the highest volume McDonald's in the world,'' predicted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, after signing a joint pact with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city government. Meanwhile, the first McDonald's in a Soviet bloc country opens its doors Saturday in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> burger emporium was dedicated on Friday. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION>'s opened a restaurant in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, its first in a communist nation. Impatient customers waiting in line on opening day became so unruly that police were called. Although five more restaurants are planned for <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could be the big enchilada for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which had worldwide sales of $ 14.3 billion last year. <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malishkov </PERSON>, chief of food services for the Soviet capital, signed an agreement for the creation of up to 20 fast-food eateries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the building of a commissary to process beef, potatoes and other foods McDonald's uses. `` A Big Mac, our world-famous sandwich, will taste the same in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as it does in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> vowed at a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s city hall. The agreement, which gives McDonald's of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a 49 percent share in the Soviet-controled joint firm, is the latest business venture concluded by the Soviets with a foreign company, and th first with a Canadian firm. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> enacted a new law on joint ventures in a bid to woo capital, technology and expertise from abroad. The reform is part of changes enacted under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> designed to improve the quality and quantity of consumer goods. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last September signed a contract to open two Pizza Hut restaurants in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a joint venture. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company called AstroPizza brought a van into the capital this month to serve pizza to Soviets and foreigners, and plans to open a joint venture restaurant in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later this year. <PERSON> Malishkov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zharov </PERSON> said the Soviets want to draw upon the expertise of the U.S.-based McDonald's to improve service in their country's food industry. And the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> restaurants are only the beginning. `` We're not thinking of just opening 20 McDonald's in this country,'' <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said. `` There will be many more.'' Soviets will be able to buy a <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, the chain's double-patty hamburger sandwich, for about 2 rubles, or roughly $ 3. The first McDonald's in the Soviet capital is expected to open on Gorky Street next year, <PERSON> Cohon </PERSON> said. But nobody will say where. `` We do n't want to create any lines,'' <PERSON> Zharov </PERSON> said with a smile.

 Thousands of employees struck for higher pay at a heavy machinery plant Friday, capping a week of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor trouble since the Communist authorities suppressed Solidarity more than six years ago <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> police detained <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a senior adviser to the outlawed union. A member of his household said three plainclothesmen arrived as <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> was being interviewed by telephone by a Western radio station. Strikes began Monday with bus and streetcar drivers at <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION> in the west. Workers at the huge <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> steel works at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> in the southern industrial belt followed suit Tuesday, and on Friday it was the machinery plant at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, about 65 miles east of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>. Another job action was threatened for over the May Day holiday weekend. Solidarity activists in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s municipal transport company said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 a.m. Saturday to support the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> workers. Workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more. Prices rose 42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government reduced subsidies on many consumer items. The government has both threatened dismissals and promised to improve wages. At <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>, the 2,800 drivers won a 60 percent pay increase with an 11-hour strike. Officials of Solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities use force against strikers. They said workers in at least four other cities had declared support for the Nowa Huta action and issued strike alerts. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> quoted Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as saying in an interview the strike `` has to spread because the economic situation is bad. We really did n't want to strike because strikes have never filled a bread basket, but the government leaves us no choice but to fight for our rights.'' Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said an attempt to start a strike failed at the 18,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> heavy machinery plant, but the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said later at least one department was shut down. A Roman Catholic priest in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemiec </PERSON>, said about 7,000 strikers were occupying three department and the strike began when about 5,000 first-shift employees quit working. He said management tried to lock out most of the second-shift workers but some broke in. <PERSON> Niemiec </PERSON> said the number of strikers could be as high as 9,000, but he could not confirm the figure. He said the information came from a member of the strike committee. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, strikers customarily go to their places of employment but do not work. Often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets. About 12,000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the Lenin plant in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, which means <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> and was built as a model city in the 1950s just outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Management representatives met with the plant's government-sanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial committee that claims to represent at least half the plant's 32,000 workers The <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike is the biggfest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since those that swept the country after food price increases in 1980, bringing down a government and giving birth to Solidarity. The independent union federation was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law was declared in December 1981. Urban said there had been `` preventative detentions'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week, but did not say how many. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, the Solidarity adviser, said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been picked up around the country in the past two days. <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said police stopped his car Thursday in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and detained him, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> remained in custody. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said many police were in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and at least four Solidarity activists were detained. Demands at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> are representative: recognition of their union rights, release of detained Solidarity activists and an immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the equivalent of $ 105. The strike committee said it had sent a letter to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s archbishop before becoming pope, that began: `` We address you with our words of devotion and respect. We are sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for decent payment.'' Urban told a news conference in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>: `` The situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is not dramatic, with only one strike in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> and an attempt to organize a strike that failed in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> management had decided to fire striking workers. Labor Minister <PERSON> Ireneneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> said the government would announce tax law changes and other measures in a few days allowing enterprises to grant higher pay. He said he could not be more specific. <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, attacked `` Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and company ... who are trying to use the uneasy situation for their own political goals.'' It said demands for higher wages were `` calls for anarchy, to start unrestrained inflation, to create a situation in which we would once again have empty store shelves and the creditors would lose their growing confidence in us.''

<HEAD>Unpaid Parking Fines Down Sharply After Britain Gets Tough</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new government policy that threatens to turn diplomats' unpaid parking tickets into airplane tickets expelling them from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has foreign envoys rushing to pay their fines. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 18,000-member diplomatic community ran up only 14,437 unpaid fines last year, compared with 108,845 in 1984. Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in a written statement that the number was down 35 percent from 1986. Diplomats, under international conventions, are immune from prosecution for offenses committed in the host country, but the host can have the offender expelled. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says that in 1985 it began issuing expulsion threats against repeat parking offenders, but has not yet ordered anyone out. It said it sent out a dozen such warnings last year. Many diplomats complain they have to park illegally because their missions are in the congested heart of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, with 799 unpaid fines, topped <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON>'s list. Rounding out the top five were the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with 622, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with 551, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with 513 and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> with 435. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and 10 countries had no fines unpaid last year: <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had 77 unpaid fines, only 17 of them in the second half of the year. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had 130, including 36 in the second half. `` We decided in 1985 that we were going to take a very tough line and insist that diplomats paid their fines,'' <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> told a reporter. `` We ca n't force them to pay,'' he said, `` but we regard it as an abuse of diplomatic immunity, and we make it quite clear that, if they are persistent offenders and they do n't pay, they ca n't stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. The Foreign Office has no figures for fines paid, but <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> said: `` Up to 1984, the number of unpaid fines was rising dramatically. It is now falling even more dramatically.'' He said he would thank missions which pay their fines, and demand improvements from those that do n't. He added he was confident that all British diplomats abroad paid their fines. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of the city's Commission for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said British diplomats do have outstanding, unpaid parking tickets and, like most nations' diplomats, generally do not pay them But, he added, British diplomats get relatively few tickets. `` They have one of the best records for violations per vehicle,'' he said. In another Commons reply, <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> reported 43 alleged `` serious offenses'' by foreign diplomats in 1987, resulting in 18 diplomats being ousted. The offenses included 26 cases of drunken driving, 13 of theft and shoplifting, and one each of forgery, driving without insurance, possession of drugs and indecent assault.

<HEAD>Judge Moves To Free Multiple Personality Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled Friday that a man found innocent by reason of insanity on rape charges because he had multiple personalities is now well, apparently clearing the way for his release. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> has been confined in various mental institutions around the state for much of the time since the original ruling in 1977. Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said psychiatric and psychological reports show <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s multiple personalities have fused, and that he is well. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who was charged with rape and abduction in three attacks in the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> area, once had more than 20 personalities, according to the book `` The Minds of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>.'' As a result of the judge's ruling, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> was transferred from the maximum security section of the <ORGANIZATION> Timothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moritz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> had been confined at the <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON> center since he was captured in December 1986 after escaping from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on July 4, 1986. Officials say it will take about a month to place him in private housing and help him try to find a job. During his court appearance Friday, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> pledged to obey the law and said he wants to be a tax-paying citizen. He said he wants to continue his work as an artist, or find a job involving computers. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> still must undergo therapy twice a week for the next year, according to the judge's ruling. <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> also was charged in a November 1984 shooting at a barn on property owned by a worker at a mental health facility where he was a patient. No one was injured in the shooting, and the case was dismissed after defense attorneys claimed that <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>'s constitutional rights were violated when a jailer recorded his side of a phone conversation with his attorney.

 Delegates committed to <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are beginning to defect to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose presidential campaign is gently pursuing them. `` We do n't consider it raiding,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, a delegate tracker for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We consider it a re-introduction.'' `` It's definitely a soft sell,'' she said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> have both suspended their campaigns but have not formally dropped out of the race. They hold a combined total of just over 600 delegates. <PERSON> Tad </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, director of field operations for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said, `` We've seen some come in in the last few weeks and we expect to rack up some more with another couple of wins, which has been the case since <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.'' The number of public converts to other campaigns is still small. One of them, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Burson </PERSON>, was among 23 delegates in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> pledged to support <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> based on the results of the state's March 8 presidential primary. But he has recently switched to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was my first choice, but as I see it, he's no longer in the race and I had to choose between the people who are,'' <PERSON> Burson </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Burson </PERSON> is one of more than 3,500 `` pledged'' delegates to the Democratic National Convention who were being picked because of their support for a particular presidential candidate. Party rules say those delegates `` shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.'' Party leaders say that means they are free to change their minds. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Democratic Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s decision to put his campaign on hold makes his delegates `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates'' in name only. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said he's fielded questions from a number of them since the campaign was suspended on April 21. `` The main question is: ` Are we still going?''' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` We had a number of the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> people who thought that since <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was no longer there that they may be bumped.'' `` They will go to the convention as <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` They'll vote for somebody other than <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>; that's for sure.'' That's not how the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign prefers to see it. `` Our preference is at this point in time that the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates remain <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> delegates,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcheson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s delegate tracker, who was not aware of <PERSON> Burson </PERSON>'s defection `` I think there remains a great deal of affection and loyalty to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> and that's what we're going to continue to see.'' But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> senator expected that some of his delegates would go elsewhere when his campaign was suspended on April 7. `` He made clear to his delegates and other supporters around the country that he remained a candidate and intended to go to the convention but also expressed understanding for any individual decisions that his changed status prompted with his supporters and delegates,'' <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said later that he was wrong about the <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> campaign being resigned to losing delegates. He said the campaign was staying in contact with the delegates by telephone and letter to encourage them to stay with <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> is considering a meeting after June 7 to `` consult with his delegates about what they would prefer to do at that point.'' <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said. So far, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has lost one delegate to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ although she is one of the `` super delegates,'' a special class reserved for party leaders and politicians who are free to support whomever they please. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said two recent developments in the party have contributed to the phenomenon of defecting delegates: the suspended campaign that is neither active nor abandoned and a rules change. `` We've got a new fuzzy area of the law, as it were,'' Ms. <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> said. Eight years ago, a Democratic delegate was bound to support his candidate, no matter what, and the rules were changed specifically to soften that, she said. `` I think the operative word here is ` in all good conscience,''' she said. `` In 1980 people were calling the delegates automatons.''

 Sikh militants holed up in the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> attacked para-military troops on Friday and at least 24 people were killed in other parts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> in separatist violence, police and news reports said. The slayings raised to 862 the number of people killed this year in attacks blamed on the radical movement for a Sikh homeland. At least six people were killed and 80 injured when five bombs exploded on Friday afternoon in the crowded main market of <LOCATION> Batala </LOCATION> town, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said. It said police clamped an indefinite curfew on the town, 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, after the explosions. At least two of the victims were reported to be militants. Three people who were believed to have placed the explosives were arrested, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Merchants around <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s holiest shrine, closed their shops when militants fired at a patrol of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, said police superintendent <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The attack started when the troops attempted to arrest a wanted militant as he was heading for the shrine, <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. The troops returned the fire but the militant escaped in the confusion. One woman was injured in the 20-minute firefight, he said. The attack prompted authorities to place the city's police force on a `` red alert'' although security forces did not attempt to enter the temple. Security forces have entered the temple previously but usually avoid doing so because of Sikh sentiment. Police estimate that at least 100 militants, armed with automatic rifles, are hiding in the shrine. In other militant attacks Thursday night, at least seven Hindus were shot and killed in two villages near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Five Sikhs were killed in a raid on a farmer's home, also near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. At least six other people, including four Sikhs and two unidentified victims, were shot and killed in other attacks through the state. Sikhs form 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but make up a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The militants have been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983, claiming discrimination by the Hindu majority.

<HEAD>Navy Opens Two More Ships to Female Sailors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had begun opening additional sea-going combat support jobs to women, selecting a group of 24 for deployment on two ships later this summer. `` Two women officers and 22 women enlisted personnel will report for duty aboard the fleet oilers USS Cimarron, homeported in <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, in August and USS Monongahela, homeported in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in September,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The two ships were selected because they require the least modification to accommodate women.'' The upcoming assignments are being made under a decision announced last Dec. 21 by then-Navy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> following a special internal study on the role of women in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> adopted what he described as the first clear, concise definition of `` combat missions'' to help determine on which ships women could serve. Unless a ship or aircraft has as its primary objective the goal `` to seek out, reconnoiter and engage the enemy,'' the jobs on that ship or aircraft should be open to women, he said. That policy, when fully implemented, will almost triple the number of sea-going jobs open to women _ to a new total of almost 15,000 _ by opening billets on so-called <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ships like the Cimarron and <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION>. All told, 27 logistic ships are being opened to female sailors. `` Further assignments of women to <ORGANIZATION> CLF </ORGANIZATION> ships will continue at a measured pace from December 1988 through July 1991, based on completion of ship alterations and ship operational requirements,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has about 54,000 women on active-duty, or about 9 percent of the force. Of that total, about 5,200 are serving on 86 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sealift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> vessels _ many of them small ships, including tugs, tenders and auxiliaries of various types.

<HEAD>Calls Made For Wider Arab And Islamic Rupture Of Ties With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Saudi Arabian newspaper on Friday called for the expulsion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from the 46-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> newspaper urged Arab countries to sever ties with the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> state. The calls in the pro-government newspapers followed <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s rupture of its diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The Saudis said they ended relations because of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s `` terrorism and subversion.'' The Saudi statement referred to riots by Iranian pilgrims at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> last year during the Haj, the annual pilgrimage to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrines More than 400 people died in the violence July 31. After the riots, Iranians attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Iranian Revolutionary Guards conducted strikes on commercial shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region. Urging all Moslem states to follow the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> example and sever their ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the newspaper <PERSON> Al-Yawm </PERSON> said the Islamic conference `` should also expel <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and turn over its seat to the Iranian opposition.'' Former Iranian leaders <PERSON> Shahpour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON>, who are living in exile, were among the first to express support for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> diplomatic break with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The paper noted that the last ministerial conference of the Islamic organization, held in March in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, had backed the Saudi condemnation of the Iranian action at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and its determination to accept only 45,000 Iranian pilgrims at the upcoming <PERSON> Haj </PERSON> as compared to 150,000 last year. The Saudis have asked all Islamic countries to reduce the numbers of pilgrams because of ongoing renovations at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. The Iranians have refused. `` When the Iranian government refuses to abide by the decision to limit the numbers of pilgrims, this means it rejects Islamic unanimity and breaks off from <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> ranks,'' the paper wrote. It also accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of being a `` source of terrorism to all throughout the world.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accuses the Saudis of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, its enemy in the 7 -LCB- - year-old gulf war The Iranians regularly attack neutral ships, including Saudi vessels, in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on its tankers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> frequently calls for the overthrow of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> government. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted the Martyrs' Foundation, which helps the families of slain soldiers, as saying: `` It will not be long before the sacred shrines will be free from the blood-dripping claws of the corrupt and dependent sheiks.'' The Martyrs' Foundation said the decision to limit the number of pilgrims to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> was `` grossly impudent and contrary to the Koran,'' Islam's holy book. In <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the country closest to the Iraq-Iran war and a target of systematic acts of sabotage by pro-Iranian elements as well as Iranian missile strikes, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> said the government and other Arab states should follow the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> example. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has also been accused of collusion in the recent hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. The hijackers, who killed two hostages, had demanded the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` As we praise <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s firm and correct decision, we demand that this decision be turned into a pan-Gulf and even pan-Arab one because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has opted for being an enemy of the Arabs and it does not conceal its enmity, threats and ambitions but declare them in a flagrant manner,'' <ORGANIZATION> Al-Anbaa </ORGANIZATION> wrote.

<TEXT>
 A hundred photographers fanned out across <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Friday, using thousands of rolls of film for an everyday portrait of the state. It was just another day in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, where inside a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school, children began with the pledge of allegiance, a prayer and a song. <PERSON> Seny </PERSON> <PERSON> Norasingh </PERSON>, one of the photographers for the planned book `` A Day in the Life of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' also was there. <PERSON> Norasingh </PERSON> watched the first-graders as they chanted a phonics lesson, then began to use his camera, crouching near the small desks. Several other photographers took photos of Norasingh or of their colleagues taking pictures of him. Meanwhile, 99 other men and women with cameras were on assignment in <LOCATION> Chico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, Yosemite and other places between <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Centro </LOCATION> for the book. The volume, set for fall publication, is part of a series of books containing photographs taken in a certain place in a single day. `` The concept is extremely easy to grasp and elegantly simple. That is, you're creating a visual time capsule, a family album,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smolan </PERSON>, began the series seven years ago. The books have focused on <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, formerly managing editor of Contact Press Images in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Smolan </PERSON>, a former Contact photographer, have published most of the books themselves, but they did n't achieve great commercial success until the book on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> came out in 1986. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he believes a market for another book on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> exists, despite a glut of coffee-table books filled with photos of the state, because most are filled with cliches of beauty spots `` or they go completely in the other direction and you see a freak show.''

<HEAD>Mother Removed From Trust Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mother of teen rocker <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> has been replaced as trustee of the singer's $ 100,000 trust fund in the latest development of legal wrangling between the two. <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> said in an interview published Friday by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that she was removed as her 16-year-old daughter's trustee Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. All court documents filed in the dispute have been sealed, and all hearings have been closed. Black named the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> and the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Prager </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> as new trustees; boosted the percentage of <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s record earnings that must go into the trust fund from 30 percent to 50 percent; and authorized the new trustees to make income tax payments out of the account. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> hired attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankenheimer </PERSON> three weeks ago to act on her behalf in freeing her finances from both her mother and manager <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> has three Top 10 singles, including `` I Think We're Alone Now,'' and sold more than 4 million copies of her first album, meaning her royalties should amount to more than $ 2 million, according to <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>'s contract with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, the Times reported Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and alleged in court documents that <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> were working toward a break between the singer and her immediate family, beginning on March 9 when <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s mother reported her missing because she failed to return home from <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> recording studio The rock star, who does not use her last name, told the <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s Station she was not a runaway, and later filed in court for status as an emancipated minor, meaning she would have adult rights in contractual matters. `` I felt that <PERSON> George </PERSON> wanted all the control and <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> went along with it because she had her dream of being a star and he -LRB- <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> -RRB- could give it to her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` I was never introduced as <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s mother. I was never introduced to anybody of any great importance. <PERSON> George </PERSON> did n't want anybody to know I was <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s mother.'' In late March, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was appointed temporary guardian pending the outcome of the emancipation proceedings. No hearings have been scheduled on the matter, which is being handled by a court-appointed mediator. <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON>'s production contract with <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> gives him 50 percent of her royalties, and a management agreement grants him 20 percent of her concert earnings. Along with those earnings, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> has a $ 350,000 merchandising deal with <ORGANIZATION> Winterland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> clothing and souvenirs, said Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. He claimed <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> `` is attempting to kidnap her through the court. It's a judicial kidnapping.'' `` That statement is not worthy of a response,'' <PERSON> Frankenheimer </PERSON> said. `` We believe the proper forum for deciding this matter is the court and not the press.'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the newspaper she believes <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> now could gain control of the trust, even though <PERSON> Black </PERSON> handed its control over to neutral third parties. <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> would seek a reconsideration of the decision, or appeal it.

 A woman convicted of stealing money from the law firm of a man who recently withdrew as the nominee for deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney general was sentenced Friday to 18 months in prison and fined $ 5,500. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> had claimed during her trial that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a partner in the law firm who was nominated to be the No. 2 man in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, had authorized her to write checks to herself because they were having an affair. Shepherd denied the accusations under oath, and <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> never presented any evidence to show that there had been an affair. Sinner, 29, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, was sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined $ 5,000 for stealing $ 147,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sandberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> while she worked as a bookkeeper for the firm for several months beginning mid-1986. She was alleged to have used the money for personal expenses and to purchase luxury items such as a BMW. Sinner was sentenced to an additional six months and fined $ 500 for making a false statement to the government. The prosecutor said she had falsely claimed in a doctor's letter to have terminal cancer. Sinner's attorney said the convictions would be appealed. She is free on $ 10,000 bond. On April 5, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> to become the No. 2 man in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the March 29 resignation of <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. But two weeks later, Shepherd withdrew from consideration for the job, citing the public scrutiny he was undergoing and the pressure it was putting on his family.

 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials wrapped up four days of negotiations Friday without reaching any agreement as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> toughened its stand against further liberalization of its trade practices. `` We had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action plan,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Assistant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, said at the end of the talks. `` Unfortunately, we have fallen short of that ambitious goal.'' The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> delegation bluntly refused to reduce tariffs on about 60 agricultural products or lift import bans on peanuts, poultry and animal organs. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to renew a five-year bilateral agreement next year that limits <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s rice exports was also turned down. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> called for the scrapping of a 1986 agreement that allows Taiwanese magazines to advertize American cigarettes, claiming it promotes smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco growers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials rejected the request. `` We would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural products because we did not protect our farmers more than your country did,'' Vice Economic Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-shien </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> delegation, said at the closing ceremony. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials, however, promised to review a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help reduce <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s massive trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which totaled $ 16 billion last year. Hundreds of farmers staged a protest in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Tuesday, calling on the government not to concede to any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands. The farmers claimed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other agricultural products have already hurt their livelihood. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February, including 480 agricultural products, with import duties dropping to an average rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent. In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to take measures to curb the rampant infringement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights but differed with their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts on major details. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials agreed in principle that translations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> works require the permission of their authors, but opposed making the agreement retroactive. <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies lose `` tens of millions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars'' every year because of pirated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> works in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are still available at many book stores. That agreement does not extend to translations. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also agreed tentatively to give either patent or copyright protection to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor products.

<TEXT>
 Soviet presence has wrought little change in this city of dusty streets and mud huts, but hatred of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> forged an alliance among tribal enemies that lasted 10 years. Whether the Moslem guerrillas will revel in their rout of the Soviets after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leaves or press on with the fight to oust President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his Communist government is an open question. The patchwork of tribes and nationalities that joined forces, more or less, after the Communist coup in April 1978 have a much longer history of strife and infighting. Few of the merchants, farmers, students and government workers biding their time in the relatively safe capital display much emotion when asked what they expect to happen when the 115,000 Soviet soldiers are gone. Few hold out much hope for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, a former head of the secret police chosen by the Kremlin two years ago to President <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>. The Soviet military forces are to begin leaving by May 15 and be out in nine months. Equally few expect a unified opposition to emerge. For ordinary Afghans, replacing the peril and loss of the civil war with the familiar troubles of the past would be welcome. `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has always had problems,'' a young taxi driver observed in broken English. `` What will happen after the Russians leave, we will see.'' Dislike of the Soviets and nostalgia for the monarchy ousted by the military 15 years ago are strong among Afghan civilians. They seem eager to return to their former lives, when battles were as numerous but dealt with land and water instead of ideology. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mir </PERSON>, an English-speaking antique dealer who parks his blue Mercedes outside a cluttered shop on Chicken Street, says business is good despite the war, but he would be happy to leave it all behind for his native city of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>. `` My house there was destroyed twice, so we came to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'' in the 1970s, he said. The attackers were a neighboring tribe that coveted his fertile land, not political opponent. Mir said he would like to see the king return and the Soviets leave. `` I do n't do business with the Russian dogs,'' he told an American visitor. `` I send them to the Indian next door.'' Just then, three Soviet soldiers with automatic rifles passed the shop, looking uncomfortable as they patrolled the shopping street. At the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> market, a warren of low-roofed hovels in central <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> named for the late Soviet leader, there is a brisk trade in Soviet machinery and spare parts. One merchant said he would leave soon for his home in western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because Soviet troops there were packing up to leave. How will he make a living after a decade of dealing in Soviet hardware? He shrugged and said: `` We made our business in other ways before the Soviets came and we will make it in other ways when they leave.'' About 2 million people live in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. It crouches in dun-colored poverty in a broad basin ringed by high mountains, which the guerrillas control. Women wearing full-length pleated silk veils sort onions, carrots and geens for sale in their market stalls, as others did for generations before the Soviets came. Crowds of shoppers and traders throng the narrow walkways between open troughs carrying waste water. The smell of raw sewage from the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> mingles with exotic scents from the spice shops. Rocket fire occasionally reaches the city from the mountains. Car bombs have become more frequent, like the one that killed six passersby and wounded 49 other people on Wednesday, the 10th anniversary of the Communist coup. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Masum </PERSON> said he believes fewer than 20 percent of Afghans are concerned with politics and even he, a member of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s party, is ready to cope with whatever political situation develops. He and other Afghans are just tired of war. `` I think if there was a true coalition government, including the king, we would all be happy,'' <PERSON> Masud </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has offered the guerrillas a coalition but they have refused. At a news conference Thursday he suggested a role in the government for former King <PERSON> Sahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, but did not say what it would be. `` I just want to go to my home as soon as they will let me,'' said <PERSON> Masum </PERSON>, an interpreter with the party <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, Solidarity and Friendship. He and his wife fled their village outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the early days of the war. `` I'm not afraid of either side,'' he said. `` Now I interpret for the government. Maybe later I will interpret for someone else.''

<TEXT>
 Disgruntled truckers are queuing up into 50-rig convoys and creeping along <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> interstates to protest a new state law that has boosted the gasoline tax and lowered the speed limit for large vehicles. The convoys are a new wrinkle in a month-old protest by truckers boycotting <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> truckstops, gas stations and restaurants to call attention to regulations that hurt their business. State police have tracked 12 convoys since Tuesday night, when the first was reported, Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollingsworth </PERSON> said Friday. The lined-up trucks were moving about 40-55 mph, staying in one lane for the most part, and not interfering with regular vehicular traffic, said <PERSON> Hollingsworth </PERSON>. The convoys averaged about 50 semi tractor-trailers, and most were reported on Interstate 70, which passes from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. The truckers are unhappy with a state law that went into effect April 1 lowering the speed limit for heavy trucks from 65 mph to 55 mph on rural sections of interstates. For light trucks and cars, the speed limit remains 65 mph. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> also boosted its gasoline tax by 1 cent per gallon earlier this month. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, a trucker from <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said the lowered speed limit would take money out of his pocket. `` If I slow down, I lose $ 2 or $ 3 per hour,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, who had stopped Friday to eat at the Indy 500 Truck Plaza in <LOCATION> Whitestown </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` We're the only occupation in the country that gets penalized for working overtime.'' Truckers were n't the only ones complaining. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, owner of the Stop 1 Truck Plaza in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the boycott had cut his food and fuel sales by 30 percent. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said although he thought the truckers have a legitimate complaint, he does not approve of their methods. `` I agree the state is doing the wrong thing, but why do n't they go to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and circle the wagons?'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> asked. The boycott was the brainchild of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> disc jockey <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, whose `` Interstate 700'' show is broadcast nightly on WLW-AM. <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON>, who goes by the name `` Truckin' Bozo'' on the air, is one of the founders of the four-month-old <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truckers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 2,000 truckers. He said he drove an 18-wheeler for one week in 1968. `` Their votes are in another state and do n't count in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sommers </PERSON> said of his trucker listeners and why he urged the boycott of truckstops, gas stations and restaurants in the state. `` You have to make the voters in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> pay attention.'' <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> independent contractor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> protest may be the start of a nationwide movement. `` This thing's going to grow. It's starting here, but it's going coast to coast,'' said <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>.

<HEAD>No Breakthrough In Sight For Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 40-nation <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> wound up its spring session Friday with no breakthrough in sight on a global ban on chemical weapons even though many delegates agree the ban is more urgent than ever. Negotiations on a convention prohibiting the development, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons and providing for their destruction dominated the three-month meeting. However, early pronouncements that a text could be finalized this year clashed with the reality of the complexities involved, delegates said. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Meiszter </PERSON>, president of the conference for April, told a press conference that he was optimistic that agreement will come `` in the near future.'' But other conference sources, while acknowledging further progress, simply said many unresolved problems make any predictions impossible. At the same time, addresses to the conference have stressed that the continued use of chemical weapons in the war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have added urgency to the 20-year-old negotiations. The latest addition to the potential stumbling blocks is <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s insistence on provisions allowing `` security stocks'' of chemical weapons for eight years after the convention enters into force. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> argues that such a possibility is needed in view of the `` very large disproportion'' between existing chemical stocks. This is an evident reference to the Soviet arsenal. The Soviets say they have 50,000 tons of chemical weapons, but Western intelligence sources say that is a gross understatement. Obsolete <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons stockpiled in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are to be removed in 1992 under an informal understanding between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. This would leave the Soviets with the only chemical weapons left on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> territory. Diplomatic sources who insisted on anonymity said no other delegation supports the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> proposal because in effect it would give countries that do not have chemical weapons the go-ahead to start production of the arms the moment the convention is ratified. `` It is the top issue now,'' said one Western source. `` I ca n't see any treaty if <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> sticks to its position. The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative, ambassador <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>, was quoted in an interview as saying that the negotiations are getting to the point `` where we are going to have one -LRB- a ban -RRB- or not going to have one.'' <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON> said the problems with the treaty range from details of anti-cheating provisions to monitoring the civilian industry to make surce that chemicals are not diverted to hostile uses. The interview was printed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission's Daily Bulletin. It did not include any mention of the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> proposal. Up to now, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are the only member countries that have admitted possession of chemical weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not officially disclosed its reserves but they are generally reported to total less than 30,000 tons. Western sources estimate at least 15 other countries may have chemical weapons.

<HEAD>Operation Planned To Separate Twins Joined At Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A medical team plans a marathon, high-risk operation to separate 16-month-old Siamese twins joined at the head, doctors said Friday. Doctors at <LOCATION> Baragwanath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the main hospital in the black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, performed two preliminary operations in October in preparation for Tuesday's surgery. The procedure is expected to take at least nine hours. The twin girls, <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON>, were born Dec. 7, 1986, to <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON>, an unmarried, 33-year-old black domestic worker who earns about $ 60 a month. The girls share a major blood vessel in their heads. Doctors partially clamped the vein in the earlier operations in hopes that lesser blood vessels would take over its functions. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON>, head of the medical team, said the chances for success were not high, but that doctors would not sacrifice one of the girls to save the other. `` This is going to be a long, lengthy, intricate operation which carries many dangers with it,'' <PERSON> Lipschitz </PERSON> told a news conference Friday. `` The prognosis is still very grave.'' `` Though the chances are still not in both the children's favor, at this moment they appear to stand the best chance that we can give them under the present state of the art,'' he said. The girls have a combined weight of 33 pounds. <PERSON> Mpho </PERSON> appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak, while <PERSON> Mphonyana </PERSON> is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as advanced, the hospital said. The Baragwanath doctors have received advice from <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, where in September doctors separated West German twins joined at the head. Both boys survived and were sent home in March, but they reportedly are suffering physical and mental problems. Ms. <PERSON> Mathibela </PERSON> was asked to make a $ 5 contribution to the costs of the operation, which otherwise are being covered by the hospital and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> medical school.

 The seconds are ticking down for the castle that once kept the world running like a clock, a victim of changing times. Herstmonceux Castle, the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>, went on sale Thursday for an estimated $ 11.2 million to $ 18.7 million. The observatory, where <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was once calculated as the reference point for the world's time zones, is expected to move into <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1990. Time, apparently, has passed the operation by. `` The reason for the move from <LOCATION> Herstmonceux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> is that most of the observatory's observational work is now done overseas, atmospheric conditions abroad being far more favorable than anywhere in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isles </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> real estate agent. `` As a result, a new home base more suited to the requirements of modern astronomy is to be built at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>.'' Astronomers were up in arms two years ago when the government said it would sell the castle in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, 21 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> in the county of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sussex </LOCATION>, and move the observatory. <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> clocks, first at <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> and then at <LOCATION> Herstmonceux </LOCATION>, once calculated <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> for the world. But in the past decade, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has only been a minor contributor to a Paris-based international time service that uses 250 clocks around the world. The observatory said in 1985 that for financial reasons it would let its six atomic clocks stop after 101 years of calculating <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Time </LOCATION>. The clocks contain the atomic element cesium, which must be replaced every few years at a cost of nearly $ 200,000. The observatory's main functions now are confined to supporting its new telescopes in the <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where clean air permits observation, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s astronomers still opposed the move to <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. They said it would scatter the observatory's archives and rare books and end three centuries of independent excellence. The observatory was founded in 1675 by King Charles II. It moved to its present location _ a 20th century copy of the original Herstmonceux castle _ in 1946 because pollution interfered with stargazing at its <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> location in southeast <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The buildings at <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, along with the brass strip marking longitude zero, the Prime Meridian from which the world measures its time zones, remain open as a museum. <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> predicted the sale of the castle, which stands on 368 lush acres, will generate inquiries from around the world.

<HEAD>President Signs Measure On International Child Custody Disputes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Friday designed to make it easier for parents to recover children who have been wrongfully abducted across international borders in domestic custody disputes. The measure implements the 1980 Hague Convention on the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aspects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abduction </ORGANIZATION>, to which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a party. The convention creates a treaty obligation for the prompt return of such children. The convention was written to cover instances such as one in which an American marries a German while stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with the armed forces, they have a child and settle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the German partner then returns to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with the child. Supporters of the measure said current law provides no way to assure speedy determination of custody rights in such a situation. The administration supported the bill, although the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected to one provision giving federal and state courts concurrent jurisdiction to hear cases brought under the convention. The department contended that federal courts never have been, and should not be, involved in custody matters.

 Two Marine helicopter pilots missing since U.S.-Iranian fighting in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on April 18 were declared `` killed in action'' Friday after the corps disclosed that a hostile radar had targeted their copter before it disappeared. A Marine fact-finding board, `` after reviewing all the evidence in this case, determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that these Marines had been killed as a result of hostile action, sustained in combat or relating thereto,'' the corps said in a statement. The corps refused to say the AH-1T Cobra gunship flown by Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had definitely been shot down by Iranian forces, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has claimed. But the statement conceded: `` In making its recommendation, the fact-finding body provided the following explanation: ` While being vectored -LRB- directed -RRB- to identify an unknown surface contact, Capts. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> reported a fire control radar lock-on. The USS Wainwright lost communication and radar contact with Capts. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>.''' The term `` surface contact'' is normally used to refer to a radar signal indicating the presence of a boat. A fire control radar is used to track targets for a gun or missile. The Wainwright, a cruiser from which the two Marines were flying, was attacked at one point during last week's fighting by an Iranian patrol boat, suggesting other Iranian boats could have been in the area. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were assigned to Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 167 at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. During the day of fighting between <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships and Iranian vessels, the two were sent up on what the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has described as a routine patrol after the <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> helped destroy an Iranian offshore platform. During the fighting, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sank or crippled six Iranian vessels without any of its ships being hit. With the exception of the two missing Marines, no Americans were injured or killed in those battles. Forty-four Iranians were reported killed. On April 20, when the two Marines were formally declared missing, the Pentagon disclosed it was investigating a radio challenge to the Cobra heard before it disappeared. Friday's statement, disclosing <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> had themselves reported a hostile radar contact, provided the first indication the helicopter had become a target. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials until Friday had played down <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s claims to have destroyed the Cobra, noting the Iranians did not begin making the claim until after the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> itself announced the helicopter was overdue. But in its new statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said its fact-finding board had concluded there was `` sufficient evidence to conclude that these Marines had been killed as a result of hostile action ... -LRB- even though -RRB- neither the helicopter nor the remains of the pilots have yet been recovered.'' `` ... It is not necessary to have recovered the remains to make a determination of ` killed in action,''' the service added.

 Thousands of black and mixed-race students near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> boycotted class Friday, protesting the detention of teachers and restrictions on anti-apartheid activity. One foreign photographer was arrested at one demonstration and detained for more than an hour. Eight secondary schools in <LOCATION> Tembisa </LOCATION>, a black township northeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, were deserted for a second straight day to protest the detention of an English teacher, education department officials said The teacher, <PERSON> Themba </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohambi </PERSON>, was detained Monday and released Thursday, officials said. No official reasons for his detention were given, but The Sowetan, a black-oriented daily newspaper, said it was believed to be related to <PERSON> Mohambi </PERSON>'s involvement in anti-apartheid political activity. A boycott also was reported at a high school in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> because of the detention of a teacher there. In <LOCATION> Athlone </LOCATION>, a mixed-race township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, several hundred students demonstrated outside their high school Friday, protesting actions by the security forces, the suspension of teachers and restrictions on anti-apartheid activity. News photographer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who was working for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>, the British news agency, was arrested during the demonstration outside <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was taken to a police station where he was held for more than an hour before being released, other photographers said. Police told <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> he was under investigation for allegedly violating state of emergency regulations which prohibit journalists from being at the scene of unrest. The demonstration was the latest in a series of protests and boycotts in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area in two weeks in one of the most extensive outbreaks of political unrest in the schools since a nationwide classroom boycott ended in 1986. Police said one <ORGANIZATION> Athlone </ORGANIZATION> school was set one fire Thursday and extensively damaged. In nearby <LOCATION> Bonteheuwel </LOCATION>, police said, a bus was firebombed and a private vehicle stoned.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says He Made Progress With Reagan On Acid Rain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday he made some headway in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> toward curtailing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acid rain emissions reaching <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but opposition parties taunted him for the lack of results. `` The tables have turned and we have a greater opportunity to arrive at a valid treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said after returning from talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. Both the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> slammed the Conservative prime minister, who has emerged from four annual summits with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> claiming progress on acid rain, only to be disappointed by a lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. In a heated exchange in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s latest claim and described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` the only head of government in the modern world who believes that trees cause pollution.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> once said birds and trees contribute to air pollution and has refused to order costly acid rain controls. `` The prime minister, in four years of talks, four years of buttering up to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telling him everything he wanted to hear, has n't got one bit of progress on acid rain,'' <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to begin priority talks with <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> on an eight-point proposal <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> delivered with respect to an acid rain treaty. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> termed the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks `` a significant new chapter opened.'' He noted that during the summit, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators at United Nations-sponsored talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> dropped their demand for the right to emit 20 percent more nitrogen oxides. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Thursday, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said he would remain persistent on the issue, but not become belligerent. `` What do you do? Do you declare war? Interrupt relationships?'' he asked rhetorically. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> added that leading members of <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> also reacted favorably to his call for a 50 percent reduction in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> smokestack emissions causing at least of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s acid rain. `` A treaty is inevitable between the two countries,'' he said. The major causes of acid rain are nitrogen oxides from motor vehicle exhausts and sulfur dioxides from power plants.

<HEAD>Louvre Has Successful Fund-Raiser to Buy Masterpiece</HEAD>

 A fund drive has raised most of the $ 5.6 million needed to buy a 17th century masterpiece by <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Tour </PERSON>, and the government said Friday it will provide the rest so the painting will remain in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The austere portrait `` St. Thomas'' is the last work of de la Tour -LRB- 1593-1652 -RRB- still in private hands. With the campaign closing Saturday, about $ 4.2 million of the necessary 32 million has been raised from bequests, corporations and visitors to the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. The final contribution from <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will allow the Louvre to buy the painting from the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, an international charity group founded in the 11th century. It has been on show at the <LOCATION> Jeu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paume </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> annex, since the campaign began March 22 and has attracted thousands of visitors, many of whom put dropped modest donations into the tall black urn at the entrance, said <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sylvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Poujade </PERSON>. When the fund drive began, Finance Minister <PERSON> Eduoard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON> said the government would pay a substantial share to keep the painting in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Ministry officials confirmed Friday that state funds would put the campaign over the top. The Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> acquired the painting in 1985 in the will of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruille </PERSON>, an unmarried countess who lived alone in her castle in central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The masterpiece, which she was said to keep under her bed, was a family heirloom, Ms. <PERSON> Poujade </PERSON> said. Rules of the order, a non-profit group specializing in hospital work, require it to sell such valuable possessions and use the money for its charities. Officials of the organization said several foreigners offered to buy the painting but it preferred to give <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> an opportunity to add it to de la Tour paintings already in the Louvre, including the famous `` Tricheur'' -LRB- Cheater -RRB-. Proceeds from the sale will help build a hospital in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the mentally and physically handicapped, the order said.

<HEAD>Prices to Farmers Unchanged on Average in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products in April were unchanged, on average, for the second month in a row but were still 4 percent above a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` Prices were higher for soybeans, cattle, hay and oranges, and lower for lettuce, eggs, milk and strawberries,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 1.8 percent from January and averaged 3.7 percent more than in April 1987. `` Higher prices for feeder pigs, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, tractors and other machinery contributed most to the increase from January,'' the report said. Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a record in 1987 of about $ 57 billion. This year's net _ the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.1 percent average increase in 1987. According to the preliminary April figures, based mostly on mid-month averages, the index for livestock and livestock products was unchanged from March but was up 0.7 percent from a year ago. `` Higher prices for cattle, calves and broilers were offset by lower prices for eggs, milk and hogs,'' the report said. Crop prices overall were up 0.9 percent from March and averaged 9.9 percent more than a year ago. The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of soybeans, was up 3.3 percent from March and averaged 22 percent more than in April 1987. Soybeans prices, at $ 6.36 per bushel, were up 30 cents during the month. Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers, overall, dropped 4.4 percent from March and also were down 4.4 percent from a year ago. The prices of most individual vegetables rose from March to April, but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices. April farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same as in March and February. A year ago the April index was 125 percent. The quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in April, down two percentage points from the revised January reading of 53 percent. The revised parity ratio for April 1987 also was 51 percent. Although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded because it does n't take into full account changes in farm productivity, others contend the ratio is useful in comparing year-to-year changes. Under the parity formula, prices farmers get for commodities are compared with prices they pay to meet expenses. It then uses a 1910-14 measurement to express what happened. At 100 percent, the indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying power as they had in 1910-14. For example, the average price of wheat in April was $ 2.81 per bushel, according to the preliminary figures. That was 40 percent of the parity price of $ 7.07 per bushel. The report also said: _ Cattle averaged $ 68.90 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 68.30 in March and above the $ 62.60 reported for April 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 41.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 42.20 in March and $ 50.80 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 1.85 a bushel, was down from $ 1.86 in March, but was up from the average of $ 1.52 a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.81 per bushel, compared with $ 2.74 in March and $ 2.63 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 8.41 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 8.79 in March and $ 3.63 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 6.36 per bushel, compared with $ 6.06 in March and $ 4.90 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 57.3 cents per pound, compared with 57.7 in March and 50.4 cents in April 1987 _ Eggs were 45.5 cents per dozen, compared with 50.8 cents in March and 54.8 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 11.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.90 in March and $ 12.20 a year earlier _ Broilers were 28 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 27.5 cents in March and 29.2 cents a year ago

 Spattered by blood and buffeted by debris after their plane's roof blew off high over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the frightened passengers aboard <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 243 helped one another into life jackets and waited calmly. A stewardess was blown out of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, and 60 of the 89 passengers and remaining crew of four were injured before the plane made a safe emergency landing here Thursday. `` I heard a loud explosion and I saw my bag from under the seat in front of me fly right out of the aircraft,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupihea </PERSON>, who was in the first-class section at the front of the plane. A piece of conduit ripped loose from the plane and punctured <PERSON> Kupihea </PERSON>'s arm. `` I kept my head down; I pulled out my life vest; I used it as a cushion. You can see the wind blowing in your face,'' he said. <PERSON> Kupihea </PERSON> said he noticed that the passenger next to him, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, was bleeding so he covered him with a seat cover. `` When I looked out of the aircraft and saw the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, I told him, ` Hang on, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, hang on, we're going to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, needed seven stitches to close a cut on his head. The passengers were frightened but calm, some of them reported after the severely disabled plane made a safe emergency landing here, about 15 minutes after the plane was ripped apart during a flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON>, a salesman from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, was reading in a window seat near the back of the plane when the jet was rocked by the blast. At first he thought his window had blown out, but he looked up and saw a gaping hole just behind the cockpit. `` A third of the roof was gone ... I looked up and saw blue sky,'' he said. The intercom system no longer worked, but oxygen masks dropped in front of passengers where the roof was still intact. `` But the wind just blew them away. We could n't use them,'' said passenger <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON>. The passengers helped each other don life-jackets and tuck their heads down between their legs, according to several passengers. As the plane landed, passengers applauded and cheered, they said. The uninjured then helped those who were hurt. `` There was debris all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON>. `` When that thing ripped open, there was all that debris flying around. `` The guy sitting next to the aisle got hit and there was blood all over,'' she said. `` It was all over the place. We are lucky to be alive,'' <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said she had put on a life jacket and placed her head between her knees. `` I sang all the hymns I knew,'' she said. `` That kept me busy.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a banker from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, said the passengers remained very calm. `` It was just a matter of waiting to see what would happen,'' he said. `` It was a long wait.'' `` Everyone was calm. Everyone was trying to help each other,'' said <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> PBX supervisor. <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> said they did n't think the plane would be able to land. `` I thought we were going to hit water. I thought, ` This is it,''' <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> said. `` At first I thought we were going to crash in the ocean,'' <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON> said. `` Then when we got close to land, I thought at least I could swim.'' The passengers appeared calm after they landed on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrant </PERSON>, a tour driver who helped take the injured to <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> Memorial Hospital. `` They were overly calm, I guess, to compensate for what they went through,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said Friday he will call up the medium-range missile treaty for debate on ratification May 11, but only if the White House and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> quickly resolve disputes over on-site inspection and other issues. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the treaty's anti-cheating provisions are effective but branded as unacceptable a new Soviet interpretation of how they should work in practice. The department renewed its call for quick <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action to ratify the treaty before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meets with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit next month. However, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the department spokesman, said the Soviets had taken a `` restrictive'' view of the right of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to inspect containers for missile components as well as to inspect Soviet medium-range missile facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has raised the issue with the Soviets at a senior diplomatic level and is awaiting a reply, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the Soviet statement indicates to him that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is `` backing away'' from the mutual understanding the two sides had of how on-site inspection would work. He and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the treaty can not be ratified before the issue is resolved `` I believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should understand it is not a good thing to start off by challenging a couple of the key points of on-site inspection,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` It is enormously important that we go into this treaty with good faith on both sides,'' he said. `` We do n't need any clouds of bad faith hanging over it.'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> emphasized that his decision to call up the treaty is tentative and debate will not begin on May 11 _ less than three weeks before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit _ unless all areas of concern are resolved. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> called on both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to quickly deal with on-site inspection problems as well as other issues. These include an ambiguity in the treaty regarding a precise definition as to what constitutes a weapons delivery system and whether or not such Star Wars weapons as those using laser beams or particle-beam generators are covered by the pact. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said another area of concern involves the White House rather than the Soviets The problem, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, is whether the administration is backing away from a commitment to an expanded long-range investment in spy satellites and other technical means used to verify Soviet compliance with the terms of arms control treaties. The intelligence panel has said that Soviet compliance with any treaty making deep cuts in long-range strategic weapons will be difficult unless such an investment is made. `` Hopefully we will be able to say all of these problems have been resolved and we will be able to go ahead full speed from there and these loose ends will be tied down,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he had no idea how long the ratification debate will take once it begins. `` We have to be absolutely certain this is a good treaty,'' he said. `` If we get our fingers burned on this, it is n't going to augur well for future arms control.'' The treaty would require the destruction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet medium-range missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Dukakis Twice Attacked on Foreign Policy Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis aide's quote, subbing last graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> absorbed twin attacks on foreign policy Friday, as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused him of `` waffling all over the field'' when the administration attacked Iranian gunboats and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called his views on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> misguided. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain Republican nominee, also previewed a second likely campaign issue for the fall, saying he favors the death penalty for convicted drug kingpins. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee, opposes the death penalty in all cases. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor focused on trade issues as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in advance of next week's presidential primary, renewing his call for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> not to veto legislation that would in part require companies to give advance notice before shutting down factories. `` These people are our neighbors.'' he said of factory workers who would be affected. `` They deserve better from their employers. They deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, his aides said they were beginning to court delegates won by exiled campaign rivals with a `` soft sell'' campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides have expressed confidence in recent days that the governor will have the 2,081 delegates needed to assure his nomination by the end of the primary season on June 7. He now has more than 1,250 delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> total, and enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks uttered in a trip through <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> provided a preview of what a fall campaign against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> might sound like. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks to an audience in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> showed he was far from ready to give up his efforts to compete through the end of the Democratic primaries. The vice president, who already has clinched enough delegates to assure his nomination, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on economic, law and order and foreign policy grounds. The vice president said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wavered initially when asked to respond to the administration's military retailiation against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` The president's different than anything else. You ca n't wait around, hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is expected to make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' relative lack of experience in foreign affairs an issue in the fall campaign, concluded: `` You ca n't do that when you're president.

I strongly favor the death penalty for the narco-traffickers,'' he said. On the plant-closing issue that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been campaigning on in recent days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his likely Democratic rival is more concerned about `` pink slips and plant closings'' than in creating new jobs. `` I do n't feel that it's midnight in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I want to talk about the fact that ... there are more Americans at work than any time in the history of the country.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been increasingly critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in recent days following a string of primary defeats, assailed his rival for not wanting to classify <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state for allegedly supporting rebels battling <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. `` It exposes a lack of understanding of foreign policy,'' he said. `` Either -LRB- he -RRB- has a lack of understanding about the options in the region or he supports a policy that's inconsistent with the progressive and democratic thrust in the world.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call to provide arms to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s Marxist government to fight the rebels. Campaign aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors diplomatic steps and economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not taken, but `` does n't rule out possibly down the road arming front-line states'' in their struggle with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>INS Chief Lauds Congressional Refusal to Extend Amnesty Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's top immigration official expressed satisfaction Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> refused to extend the 12-month amnesty program for illegal aliens which ends at midnight Wednesday. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, also said that a program of sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens is being imposed gradually and that companies should not anticipate a `` crackdown'' by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. In opposing an extension of the amnesty program, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> told reporters in an interview that the purpose of the year-and-a-half-old law of which the amnesty program is a part `` is to stop illegal immigration.'' `` We would n't want to send a message below the border that it's still OK to come here illegally and then if you do there still might be amnesty,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> made it clear, ` One time only' and stuck to their guns.'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said legalization offices will be open Saturday and Sunday. Offices also will be open until midnight Wednesday and amnesty candidates standing in line at that time will be processed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night blocked a seven-month extension of the amnesty program for undocumented immigrants. Although amnesty requests have soared in recent weeks as the deadline approaches, applications are running significantly behind initial projections. Amnesty requests total 1.29 million with another 440,000 people applying under a program for agricultural workers. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had estimated as many as 2 million would apply. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said `` nobody knows'' how many illegal aliens might qualify for the amnesty program and he downplayed the 2 million figure. He said applications are falling somewhat below initial estimates partly because non-profit groups and other non-government community groups overestimated the number of applications they would help the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> handle. Under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, aliens who came to this country illegally before Jan. 1, 1982 and who have lived here continually since then may apply for amnesty. The program also contains a system of fines for employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. Starting June 1, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has the discretion to issue warning citations or to levy fines against employers who violate the law. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> must initially issue warning citations. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> stressed the agency would remain flexible, saying there wo n't be a `` crackdown'' with fines starting June 1. `` The purpose of sanctions is n't to penalize employers,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` The purpose is to keep employers from hiring illegal aliens and if you can do it with a positive twist you're a lot better off. `` Be sure they're educated, be sure they understand why it's good business for them'' to not hire cheap illegal labor, said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> `` We can always tighten the screws to the employers and we're doing that,'' but he said the sanctions portion of the program would proceed through a `` gradual, deliberate building process. The agency is to hire 900 additional investigators through the beginning of next year and one of their prime duties will be to participate in the employer sanctions program. To date, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has issued 2,000 citations to employers and levied 80 to 90 fines.

 Actor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and longtime companion <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> were married Friday at a private ceremony in a specially built white chapel at his 160-acre horse ranch, spokesmen said. Reynolds, the 52-year-old star of `` Deliverance,'' `` <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> and the Bandit'' and `` The Best Little Whorehouse in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' announced his marriage intentions two months ago in a magazine article, but he refused to say when or where he would marry his girlfriend of five years. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Burt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dinner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, said the ceremony was completed at midafternoon Friday and the reception was under way. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, publicist for Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>; and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gershenson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' personal manager, also confirmed Friday that the ceremony was set for the afternoon in the chapel at Reynolds' ranch here.

<HEAD>House Panel Defeats Bid To Make States Ante Up for Super Collider</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee Friday refused to require states seeking the super collider atom smasher to put up at least $ 500 million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued research installation. On a 20-11 vote, the Space, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the minimum-funds amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, R-Calif., for the $ 4.4 billion superconducting super collider Just before that, members voted 16-14 against an alternative that would have required the secretary of energy to report to the committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning state should pay. The amendments were offered to the $ 3.1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research authorization bill. As it stands, the bill would authorize $ 1.6 billion over the next three years for the collider, of which $ 148 million would be for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ but with no construction funds until Oct. 1, 1989. The bill would set a limit of 25 percent on any foreign contributions and require that no more than 33 percent of the equipment be of foreign manufacture. The administration has said it believes it can get foreign countries to contribute at least 25 percent of the cost. But so far there have been no foreign commitments, and only <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has agreed to explore collaboration. Several amendments to the bill remain to be considered, including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider authorization or eliminate it altogether, and to make a 25 percent foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant atom smasher. The department sought $ 363 million for the new fiscal year, a large part of it to begin construction after site selection. That selection is to be made in November and confirmed in January. Since the department actually needs no authorization and could proceed under its general authority to conduct scientific research, the bill would be important for the collider only as a statement of congressional intent and limit on later appropriations, which the department does have to have. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, D-Ala., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations energy subcommittee, has told the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegation his panel will approve no more than $ 60 million <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are finalists to host the super collider, which comprises a 53 miles-around tunnel and associated experimental facilities for smashing beams of protons into each other at energies 20 times the maximum possible today. Current law forbids the states from offering cash contributions during the selection process. The Energy Department is insisting on donation of the land, and the states may undertake site improvements _ which may be substantial. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials figure the state's land purchase, tunneling, road and other work is worth $ 590 million, and several states have submitted sealed bids that are to be opened only if that state is chosen. Before the vote on <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s amendment, Rep. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials had claimed they would have to drop out of the competition if a minimum-funds requirement were imposed. Others were skeptical that a $ 500 million requirement would deter anyone. `` Whoever wins ... is winning a $ 50 billion economic development program,'' said the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, D-N.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly turned down attempts Friday to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops brought home from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies spend more for defense. The decisions came as the chamber worked its way through a bill authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. First, the chamber rejected, 240-120, a proposal by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to bring 30,000 troops a year back from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and 7,000 troops annually from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, starting in 1991. Then, a 332-21 vote shot down an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., to withdraw 70,000 troops a year from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Moments later, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 359-0 approval of a proposal saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration should begin talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies about defense burden-sharing. A similar call was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, but the proposal is not binding and only suggests that the negotiations should start. Both <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> tied their reduction requirements to demands that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the other 15 <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> nations should spend a bigger portion of their budgets for alliance defense. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes came as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> released its annual assessment, mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on `` Allied Contributions to the Common Defense.'' The report was accompanied by a personal pledge from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` to press at every opportunity for progress in improving allied defense capabilities and in sharing equitably the roles, risks and burdens of the alliance.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies `` make a substantial contribution to the common defense _ considerably more than they are often given credit for.'' But, he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` in some areas is doing more than most of its partners.'' `` What is very clear is that there are substantial variations in performance among individual allies,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The report says that in 1986, the latest year for which complete figures are available, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> allocated 6.8 percent of its gross national product to defense. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, which ranked second among the allies, allocated 6.1 percent. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was third with 5.1 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> at 4.8 percent and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at 3.9 percent. The remaining nations had shares of 3.2 percent or less. Legislators in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have repeatedly criticized <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations for not doing more. But they have rejected several attempts in the past three years to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where 326,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed, and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where there are about 63,000 American service personnel. `` Let's get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect them to pay their fair share,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>. `` We are subsidizing their defense.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was even more blunt. `` The real purpose of this amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that we've had it. These people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into paying for their defense.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., called <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s plan `` a dangerous and irresponsible effort to bring troops home to deal with the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- trade problem. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, opposed both plans, saying, `` this would be entirely counter-productive ... it is simply not possible to maintain the viability of a voluntary alliance of free countries if one of those countries tries to impose standards on the others.'' Rep. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bereuter </PERSON>, R-Neb., said, `` this would send the wrong message'' at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to urge <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries to spend more for non-nuclear weapons in the wake of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium-range nuclear weapons But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said, `` it's time Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> quit being taken for uncle sucker. The bill authorizes <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending of $ 299.5 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the same amount proposed by the separate bill that will be considered next month by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Differences between the bills that pass each chamber will eventually be reconciled by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee.

 A man whose first name is <PERSON> John </PERSON> mounted his third annual protest Friday and called on <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> of the world to wrest their good names away from toilets, customers of prostitutes and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> anonymity. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, armed with a well-thumbed paperback dictionary and a battered sign proclaiming April 29 `` National John Day,'' stood on a windy downtown corner, seeking to draw attention to his claims that the proper name of <PERSON> John </PERSON> has been abused. `` I'm defending the name <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' he yelled, drawing amused stares from lunchtime crowds. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, 45, freely admits there's nothing official about his cause and does n't expect to make a name for himself with the annual protests, which he said would stop after this year. But he says years of name-calling prompted him to take action. `` A major complaint, in the dictionary, is <PERSON> John </PERSON> being used as a prostitute's client or a toilet,'' he said. `` It makes a swear word out of our name, does n't it?'' He said the seedy first definition is n't even accurate. `` Over the last year also, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> are n't the ones -LRB- who've -RRB- been seeing the prostitutes. The customers -LRB- have been -RRB- Jimmies,'' <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> said, making an oblique reference to recent television evangelist scandals. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> also is upset about `` putting <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> on the toes of people who've died and they do n't know who he is.'' As part of his efforts, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a self-employed carpenter in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has created a fictitious lawsuit against society, seeking $ 12.5 trillion. Restitution could be handled by giving all <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> the day off on April 29, a date he said he picked for no particular reason. At least one <PERSON> John </PERSON> who joined <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>' demonstration said he took advantage of that idea: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmqvist </PERSON>, 20, a carpet technician, said he talked his boss into giving him a half-day off. <PERSON> Malmqvist </PERSON> said he's also irked at the way `` John'' is used in hypothetical situations such as `` Why Johnny Ca n't Read.'' `` If you're in school, they always use <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> for this, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> for that. When they're giving examples over the speakers, talking about bad kids, they always say, ` Well, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> went home and did this and that ...''' Passer-by <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, 22, said he sympathized with the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>' plight, although he did n't expect to stop using <PERSON> John </PERSON> as a generic term `` I probably still will, but I'll think about that guy over there,'' he said.

 Tree-planting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has n't gone to the dogs, by any means, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed Friday. Last year more than 3 million acres were reforested with 2.3 billion tree seedlings, an area about the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief F. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. About 87 percent of the 1987 tree plantings was on private lands, mostly in the South, he said. More than 1 million acres of the seeding involved land enrolled in the department's Conservation Reserve Program authorized in the 1985 farm law, he said. Under the program, farmers get federal aid to plant trees or grass to protect highly erodible land, plus annual rental payments for 10 years to keep the land out of crop production. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said tree planting has set annual records since 1981 when more than 2.37 million acres were reforested. By comparison, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> planted about 2.33 million acres in trees over a 10-year period in the 1930s and early 1940s. More than 2 million acres were planted under the Soil Bank program in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

 <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, the convicted rapist-mutilator who was the target of protests from towns mentioned as possible homes after his parole last year, visited <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> area relatives earlier this week, authorities said Friday. Sheriff's Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacciatore </PERSON> said a relative of the 60-year-old Tampa native told him Thursday by telephone that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> paid a short visit earlier this week and left. `` I do n't know where's he's gone,'' <PERSON> Cacciatore </PERSON> said. `` It's not that we're not concerned. We just do n't know.'' He was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker in 1978, then chopping off her forearms with an ax and leaving her to die. He served eight years of a 14-year sentence, getting out early for participating in a prison work-credit program. His presence in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> was unpublicized and provoked no outcry.

 The crew of a <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> commuter plane and controllers at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> remained cool even as the aircraft caught fire and made a crash-landing, a tape released Friday showed. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials praised the calm response of pilot <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and co-pilot <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilstead </PERSON> to the April 15 emergency. They also singled out the work of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Boniberger </PERSON>, a controller for seven years who was working his second day at <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> since transferring from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` Our people performed outstanding ... above and beyond the call of duty,'' said <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official and manager of the <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> tower. The plane touched down safely but then went out of control, ramming three passenger boarding ramps before coming to rest just feet in front of a passenger concourse. All 40 people aboard survived. Nineteen were injured and two remain hospitalized in stable condition. The tape of conversation between the de Havilland Dash 8 and <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> controllers was played for reporters at the control tower Friday. `` We're going to have to return to the airport,'' said a calm, measured voice from the cockpit of Flight 2658 about a minute after its takeoff on a scheduled trip to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. The plane was less than three miles from the airport. `` Do you have a problem?'' the tower asked. `` Yes,'' the Horizon crew responded. `` ... Reduced power in the right engine.'' The tower noted that the Horizon commuter had not officially declared an emergency and asked, `` Do you want -LRB- emergency safety -RRB- equipment?'' `` Yes,'' the crew replied, adding that the plane was carrying 40 people and 2,800 pounds of fuel. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials did not identify which crew member made each comment. Controllers then warned other aircraft on the ground to stay clear of the runway. As the Horizon plane made its approach, <PERSON> Boniberger </PERSON> reported seeing a puff of white smoke come from the right engine. Then a voice from another airplane broke into the tape: `` You've got a fire going on that airplane. The voice said the fire was in the right engine. `` From then on we knew it was something serious,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said Friday. After touchdown, the plane veered toward the airport terminal and the cockpit crew said the craft was `` out of control ... leaving the runway.'' The controller then shouted urgently, `` He's out of control.. he's out of control.'' It was the most excited response of the five-minute incident and came seconds before the plane crashed into the passenger ramps. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> expect their investigation into the crash to take at least a month.

<TEXT>
 A conference next week will bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> together for the first time to discuss troop withdrawals from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the government said Friday. The conference, to be held Tuesday and Wednesday at a secret <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> location, follows intense diplomatic activity aimed at ending the 13-year-old Angolan civil war and achieving independence for neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which is controlled by by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Announcement of the talks by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> followed a meeting Friday between <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON>, a Soviet deputy foreign minister, and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> would lead the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the talks but the delegates of the other nations were not identified. A statement from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said none of its representatives would have Cabinet rank. <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> told a news conference the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, although not a participant at the meeting, supports the `` political dynamism'' that led to the new attempt at a political settlement in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeks a timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000 Cuban military personnel in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> want <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and comply with a 1966 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> demand to give it independence. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, with Cuban help and Soviet backing, is fighting rebels of the <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Previous efforts at a settlement have stalled, in part because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s demand that the Cuban troops leave before it gives independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured the mineral-rich territory from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I and controls it under a League of Nations mandate abrogated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1966. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has bases in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, is fighting a guerrilla war for independence for the territory. The Angolan government has refused to talk directly with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the rebels are not included in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> conference. <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> said the Soviets and Angolans consider <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> `` like an arm of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In its statement announcing the meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Discussions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, on troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, will take place on May 3 and 4 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` We are pleased to have facilitated and welcome this further step in the negotiating process.'' In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said: `` As far as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is concerned, the talks are going to be about <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and it will be useful if representatives of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government could be present.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the talks could collapse if <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> seeks implementation of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution condemning <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for having troops in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. In December, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to demand withdrawal of South African troops. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has 9,000 soldiers with heavy artillery on its territory but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it has not had more than 3,000 men there at one time since May 1987.

<HEAD>Labor Unrest Spreads After Nigerian Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Labor Minister <PERSON> Abubakar </PERSON> <PERSON> Umar </PERSON> met with leaders of 22 unions Friday as labor unrest spread throughout <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> following a rise in the price of gasoline, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> radio reported. It said the union officials asked the government of President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON> to reconsider the gasoline price increase, to lower prices for food and other basic commodities, to raise salaries and to release labor leaders detained since a series of strikes began about two weeks ago. The broadcast said other representatives of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s 42 trade unions did not show up for the meeting, including those representing striking civil service and bank workers. On April 10, the government raised gasoline and diesel fuel prices by 3 percent and that was expected to be the first of a series of price increases. The action followed recommendations by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to increase petroleum prices to help cut <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s $ 1.5-billion deficit. Since the oil-boom days of the mid-1970's, Nigerians have regarded cheap gasoline as one of their rights. Even with the increases Nigerian gas sells for about 40 cents a gallon. Many <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> banks remained closed for the second day and others operated with skeleton crews because of striking workers, the News Agency of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> reported. Banks in <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Makurdi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calabar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ibadan </LOCATION> also were affected. Planes were grounded throughout <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> for most of Friday when air traffic controllers joined the strike. Aviation Minister <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Okpere </PERSON> later reopened the <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> international airport and denied any strike took place. He blamed the closure on saboteurs who he said `` disrupted the function'' of control tower equipment. Medical and health workers in <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> walked off the job Friday, the news agency said. Six people were killed in April 13 riots that began as a protest by university students and led to the government's closing more than 20 colleges and universities. Labor unions then joined in the protests.

<HEAD>Bush Says Dukakis Waffled on Strike Against Iran</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Dukakis aide's comment in last graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday that Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is more concerned about `` pink slips and plant closings'' than creating new jobs. He also said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> waffled on whether to support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s retaliatory strike against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and he accused both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of being soft on penalties for drug-pushers. He defended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to cut off the supply of drugs, but told reporters, `` I'm taking a look now at changing the whole structure of how the government is set up'' to wage the drug fight. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opposition to the trade bill that would force factories to give workers advance notice of closings. Referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s threat of a veto, he said, `` It will get one.'' The vice president, after touring a Magnavox plant that makes radios and other gear for the military, said notices of plant closings should be left to management and labor unions to work out, not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Advance notice does not protect jobs, he said. `` All that does is guarantee misery. ... I'm for plant openings.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had challenged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spell out whether he opposes the trade bill, the product of two years of bipartisan work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At a breakfast for 325 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> supporters here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor `` is talking about pink slips and plant closings, I want to talk about the fact that ... there are more Americans at work than any time in the history of the country.'' `` There's some big drug problems in this country. I hear a lot of campaign rhetoric. I hear both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> assailing the administration on this and thus denigrating those men and women in the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ... trying to staunch the flow of drugs coming in and catch the criminals,' he said. `` But I have n't heard them talk about how tough they want to be in changing the laws ... -LRB- to -RRB- put some muscle in,'' he said. `` I strongly favor the death penalty for the narco-traffickers, those kingpins that are pushing the poison on our kids.'' The certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee said front-runner <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` waffling all over the field'' on whether to support <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s strike against Iranian oil platforms and boats after a mine nearly sank a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate It took the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor most of a day to formulate a response to the strike earlier this month. `` The president's different than anything else. You ca n't wait around, hold your finger in the wind and see what the polls show,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Magnavox workers, `` We can compete. Let's remember who we are. We're the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We rolled back the frontiers and battled the deserts and the shows.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in interviews with local reporters, said he is girding for a close race in the fall. ` I think I have to get my message out, my passions, what my heartbeat is,'' he said. Asked whether Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> should resign because of on-going investigations into his activities, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Let the system work it out. ... Let the system make that deterrmination.'' Asked if he would hire <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` If he proves innocent, I certainly would hire him.'' But he said that was a theoretical question. `` We're going to have change, new people'' in the entire Cabinet, he said. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters `` we will have some fun, too,'' if the Democrats try to taint him with the so-called sleaze factor, a reference to alleged wrongdoing by high-ranking <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked if he was hurt by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s problems, said, `` I think Democrats are fair. I know the Democrats. I hear them talking about it. But there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a guilt-by-association mode where we can find in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics or campaign staff or things of that nature. I hope we do n't have to do it.'' He added, `` We will have some fun, too, trying to look into what is going on in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> depending upon which one wins the Democratic nomination. You know we've got some cannon fodder, if you want to get into that.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, responded, `` I guess his support for <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is making the vice president nervous. The vice president knows that the vast majority of Americans have serious questions about his commitment to ethics in government.''

<HEAD>Bill Requires Drug-Free Workplaces for Energy Department
Contractors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee voted Friday to permit the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to withhold payments to some of its contractors until they demonstrate they are trying to maintain drug-free workplaces. The measure was attached as an amendment to the $ 3.1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research authorization bill being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Approval came on a 20-7 show of hands. Opponents said the amendment likely would prove to be counterproductive and inappropriate. Rep. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., a former prosecutor, said if he were a contractor, he would defend arrested employees in court to avoid interruption of his income from the department Supporters said it was time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to get serious about the nation's drug problem. `` Have any hearings been held?'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We have had hearings,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` Hearings are going on right now in the juvenile courts, in the jails and in the cemeteries.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s provision would require all contracts authorized under the bill to contain a provision permitting the contracting agency _ most often the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ to withhold payments `` upon proof of use, possession or possession with the intent to distribute of any controlled substance in violation of any federal, state or local law, by an employee in the workplace, as evidenced by the conviction of such employee in a court of competent jurisdiction'' until the contractor `` demonstrates to the agency that it has taken sufficient action to restore a drug-free workplace.'' Convictions arising out of an employer's good-faith efforts to enforce a drug-free workplace `` shall be considered substantial evidence that the employer is taking sufficient action,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s amendment said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said he was unable to reach any officials in a position to comment. The Energy Department provides funds to universities and others that operate laboratories which undertake a wide variety of research, ranging from the most secret nuclear weapons to environmental projects. Prospects for the drug provisions were not immediately clear, since the science authorization bill for the department has failed to get through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the past severl years. The department has permanent, general authority to conduct scientific research, and does so with money provided by appropriations committees.

 A Nicaraguan airliner with 23 people aboard made an emergency landing Friday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> after a window blew out at 20,000 feet, an airport controller said.

 The crippled submarine USS Bonefish was towed into its home port Friday, five days after a fire and explosion rocked the vessel off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast and killed three crewmen. The Bonefish, assisted by four tugboats, tied up next to the USS Frank Cable, a submarine auxiliary ship, at the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> at midafternoon. Three crewmen were killed and 22 others from the 92-man Bonefish crew were injured in Sunday's fire. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tull </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, said an investigation of the accident is continuing. Several sailors from the Bonefish in white <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> uniforms stood on top of the sub as it was towed up the <LOCATION> Cooper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> toward the base. The crews of the Cable and the nearby guided missile destroyer USS MacDonough stood at attention as the Bonefish, an American flag flying from its conning tower, tied up. The sailors went out to meet the submarine at the harbor entrance when the tugs took the Bonefish from the salvage ship USS Hoist, which had towed the sub for two days from the site of the accident. <PERSON> Tull </PERSON> said the investigation will be headed by Capt. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the commander of the Charleston-based <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 18. No deadline exists for completing the probe, he said, adding, `` You take as long as you need to thoroughly investigate it.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON>, the chief electrician's mate on the Bonefish, had told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that most of the crew members believe the ship wo n't be returned to service. But <PERSON> Tull </PERSON> said there's been no decision on what will be done with the 30-year-old submarine, which is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s last remaining diesel-electric submarines. `` That will have to be evaluated,'' said <PERSON> Tull </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Tull </PERSON> said, three doctors from the <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to counsel Bonefish crewmen. The accident killed Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION> The three bodies were recovered from the sub Wednesday and Thursday.

 Soviet television began broadcasting in the Armenian language Friday to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the territory that has caused conflict in the neighboring <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The broadcasts are part of the government's eight-year plan to improve the cultural and economic life of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has a predominantly Armenian population but was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. Last month, the government refused demands by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and demonstrators in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> that the area be annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Demonstrations began in mid-February in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, and riots began Feb. 28 in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. At least 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis were killed in three days of violence and about 200 people were hurt, officials reported. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> now receives the Armenian-lanaguage programming on one channel in addition to two national channels broadcasting in Russian and one in Azerbaijani, the official news agency said.

<HEAD>Over 500 Vehicles Seized In Latest Drug Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has seized over 500 vehicles, ranging from 18-wheelers to boats, from people caught carrying drugs into the country in the last five weeks. The new confiscation policy is part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` Zero Tolerance'' anti-drug strategy announced last month. People caught bringing drugs into the country are arrested, their passport seized as evidence and the vehicle used to transport the drugs or drug paraphernalia is seized. In one instance, agents seized a $ 120,000 18-wheel tractor-trailer because the driver was carrying a single marijuana joint. `` If he's the owner of the truck, it's gone, he probably wo n't get it back,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the No 2 <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official, in an interview. In most cases, the government will have the vehicles sold at auction and the proceeds will go into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. If the driver caught carring drugs is n't the owner, the vehicle will be turned over to the owner for a price that includes paying the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s costs involved in confiscating the vehicle. `` There's no question that Zero Tolerance is working,'' Customs commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The message is simple. We can not tolerate any drugs in our society, and if you get caught, you will be punished.'' A total of 542 cars, trucks, tractor-trailers and boats had been seized as of Tuesday under the new program. Four boats were seized in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and four in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We hope the reaction is that they're shocked into reality,'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. `` Their cars are being taken away, they're being fingerprinted, photographed, taken before a magistrate and charged with an offense. We've had a lot of positive reaction from local communities.'' Federal criminal law allows the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to seize and dispose of vehicles involved in transporting drugs into the country. Some legal experts have criticized the portion of the policy that calls for seizing passports. They question the constitutionality of restricting a person's freedom to travel before the person has been convicted of a crime.

 Officials on Friday denied reports of an agreement with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that would have Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quit as commander of the military but not leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. An estimated 10,000 people marched Friday in a demonstration of support of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the head of <PERSON> Panamaa </PERSON>'s 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the dominant force in the civilian government. `` That agreement does not exist,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> told a news conference. `` You can hardly reach an agreement when relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are at the point they are.'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> this week. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> talking with different groups, with leaders of the opposition,'' <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. `` He also talked with the general but did not reach any agreement, because they simply were not negotiating.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February on drug trafficking charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> subsequently demanded he resign from the military and imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the narcoatics allegations. Government officials said privately the proposal on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> quitting was a `` face-saving move by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' They said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has already offered to resign subject to the establishment of a `` national dialogue'' with opposition forces. Opposition leaders were not immediately available for comment. Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-Noriega forces in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of going beyond its authority in trying to negotiate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, anti-Noriega exiles called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal a surrender with cosmetics. `` This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the road to disaster,'' said <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>, exiled representative of the Panamanian opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reached a tentative agreement with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> under which he will step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and de facto leader of the government but remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> this week. But he said the agreement was `` less than ideal'' because it did not include the general's departure from the country. The march Friday was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which includes some labor groups that support the government and some parties in the governing coalition. One of the speakers at the rally, <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The problem of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must be solved through an agreement among Panamanians and within the laws of the Defense Forces.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in mid-March offered to resign as commander of the Defense Forces before the May 1989 elections. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is suffering a cash shortage because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> santions. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has refused to make scheduled payments to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> operations. It also has set up accounts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the name of ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> for tax and other payments by Americans and American companies to this country. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continues to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was deposed by pro-Noriega legislators on Feb. 26, a day after he tried to fire the general. But opposition leaders have said they will not recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaves. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions are the result of his refusal to help the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and of efforts by rightists in the the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to prevent the scheduled turnover of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Defense Says Fair Trial Impossible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The legal requirements for using an unprecedented volume of government secrets in court will deprive Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three Iran-Contra co-defendants of a fair trial, the defense said Friday. Classified Information Procedures Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- requirements that the defense serve notice of any plans to disclose classified information in court will give the prosecution an unfair advantage, the defense said in a motion filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The requirement `` imposes burdens on the defense unprecedented in American criminal law,'' lawyers for the fired <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide and his three co-defendants said in a joint motion. `` In the circumstances of this singular case involving an unprecedented volume of classified documents'' the requirement is `` clearly unconstitutional,'' the defense said. North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, busisinessmen <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> are accused of conspiring to defraud the governent by diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Under the law, the defense would be barred from using classified evidence in the trial unless it notifies the prosecution before the trial of all government secrets it plans to disclose. The requirement `` forces the defendants to furnish the prosecution virtually every detail of the defense case, including the defendants' anticipated testimony at trial, the testimony of other defense witnesses'' and the contents of all classified documents the lawyers intend to introduce as evidence or use to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, the defense said. `` This sweeping notice requirement ... violates the defendants' fundamental constitutional rights, including such basic guarantees as the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, the right to effective assistance of counsel, the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses and the right to due process of law,'' the defense said The requirement also deprives the defendants of the right to decide during the trial whether they want to testify in their own defense. `` If the defendants do not include the substance of their anticipated testimony in their notice, then they run a grave risk that the court will preclude large portions of their testimony,'' the defense said. `` On the other hand, the defense lacks the information necessary to make an informed decision that the defendants will testify, since the defense does not know how the prosecution's case will fare at any trial,'' the brief said. The problem is particularly acute because the indictment, as described by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, `` alleges a course of conduct carried out using classified materials in classified channels from a highly classified site.'' The difficulty is compounded by the large volume of documents. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has said as many as 50,000 pages of classified documents collected during his investigation are relevant to the case. And <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled that the defense should have an opportunity to examine relevant portions of another 250,000 pages. `` The defense can reasonably predict that hundreds of thousands of pages of classified material not yet inventoried, and volumes of classified testimony, will ultimately be involved in the case,'' said the joint motion by lawyers for the four defendants. The defense motion illustrated the difficulty of applying the disclosure rule to cross-examination. `` Armed with the defendant's notice,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> can tailor his case `` to blunt the force of the defense cross-examination. The notice may alert the prosecution to specific areas of vulnerability of which it had been not aware.''

<HEAD>Frigate To Be Repaired At Maine Shipyard</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The guided-missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, badly ripped by a mine in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> two weeks ago, will be repaired at the shipyards of the Bath Iron Works in Bath, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. The service said a damage assessment of the ship was still under way in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was towed after the April 14 mining. No estimate could be made as to when the frigate could sail for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the service said the Bath Iron Works had been selected to make repairs `` because of its proximity to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the home port of the ship, and because the shipyard has both the capability and capacity for doing the restoration.'' `` The <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was built at Bath and was commissioned there in April 1986,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The cost of the repairs has not yet been determined, and will not be known until a full assessment can be made of the damage.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said no decision had been made on whether temporary repairs could be performed in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> that would allow the ship to steam home on its own power. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source said, however, the damage to the vessel was so severe that it `` almost certainly'' would have to be towed. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> almost certainly would have sunk had it not been for the performance of its crew.

 Thousands of workers struck for higher pay at a heavy machinery plant Friday, capping a week of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor trouble since communist authorities suppressed the Solidarity union more than six years ago. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> police detained <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a senior adviser to the outlawed Solidarity federation. A member of <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>'s household said three plainclothesmen arrived at his home in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> was being interviewed by telephone by a Western radio station. Strikes began Monday with bus and streetcar drivers leaving their jobs in the western city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>. Workers at the huge <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> steel works at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in the southern industrial belt, struck Tuesday and on Friday came the strike at the machinery plant at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, 65 miles east of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Solidarity activists in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s municipal transport company said in a statement they were calling a strike for 6 a.m. Saturday to support the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> action. Workers demand pay increases of 50 percent or more. Prices rose 42 percent in the first three months of 1988 because the government reduced subsidies on many consumer items. Sunday is May Day, the international Labor Day traditionally celebrated by the government and used by Polish workers to air their grievances publicly. Streets were festooned in advance with red <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> banners, red-and-white Polish flags and posters saying `` Workers of All Lands Unite.'' The government has both threatened dismissals and promised to improve wages. At <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>, the 2,800 drivers won a 60 percent pay increase ater an 11-hour strike. Officials of Solidarity threatened more strikes if authorities use force against strikers. They said workers in at least four other cities had declared support for the Nowa Huta action and issued strike alerts. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, Solidarity's founder, said in a statement: `` I appeal to authorities to maintain reason. I am warning against the return to the policy of terror, which is apparently supposed to defend reforms, while in reality it defends the way of governing which has led <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to ruin.'' He said statements by government officials indicated they might use force and urged <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s workers `` to show solidarity'' with the strikers `` in case violence takes place.'' An aide read the statement by telephone from <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s apartment in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where the 1983 Nobel Peace laureate works as a shipyard electrician. The aide, who asked that his name not be used, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> instructed regional Solidarity leaders to organize protests and strikes if the government uses force. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said an attempt to start a strike failed at the 18,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> heavy machinery plant, but the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said later at least one department was shut down. A Roman Catholic priest in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemiec </PERSON>, said about 7,000 strikers were occupying three department and the strike began when about 5,000 first-shift employees quit working. He said management tried to lock out most of the second-shift workers but some broke in. <PERSON> Niemiec </PERSON> said the number of strikers could be as high as 9,000, but he could not confirm the figure. He said the information came from a member of the strike committee. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, strikers customarily go to their places of employment but do not work. Often they hold meetings or pass out leaflets. About 12,000 workers were striking for a fourth day at the Lenin plant in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>, which means <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> and was built as a model city in the 1950s just outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Management representatives met with the plant's government-sanctioned union but refused to deal with the unofficial committee that claims to represent at least half the plant's 32,000 workers The <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike is the biggfest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since those that swept the country after food price increases in 1980, bringing down a government and giving birth to Solidarity. The independent union federation was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law was declared in December 1981. Urban said there had been `` preventative detentions'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week, but did not say how many. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, the Solidarity adviser, said by telephone before his detention that 25 people had been picked up around the country in the past two days. <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said police stopped his car Thursday in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and detained him, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> remained in custody. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said many police were in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> and at least four Solidarity activists were detained. Demands at <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> are representative: recognition of their union rights, release of detained Solidarity activists and an immediate 50 percent increase in monthly pay that averages the equivalent of $ 105. The strike committee said it had sent a letter to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s archbishop before becoming pope, that began: `` We address you with our words of devotion and respect. We are sending those words from the place of our work and struggle for decent payment.''

 The bunny suits are retired now _ some replaced by pinstripes. But the women who found success in ears and cottontails still love to lead a cheer for the bygone lifestyle. `` I think probably it is a lost era,'' said <PERSON> Sandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, who joined other former bunnies planning a Saturday night reunion. `` When someone says <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> bunny, it brings images of maybe Ziegfeld Follies ` girls' or the Rockettes.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> clubs from 1961 to 1974 and recruited other women during `` bunny hunts,'' now invests in real estate and owns a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bakery with another former bunny. Bunnydom, she said, gave her valuable training in business and public relations. `` We -LRB- former bunnies -RRB- are very successful businesswomen and we are not feminists,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. `` Feminists are the ones who attacked us. I do n't think it's fair. I know so many successful ` girls' who came from <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>.'' One successful girl _ uh, woman _ invited to the reunion was Ms. magazine founder <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON>, who once took a job as a bunny to write an expose. <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> wo n't attend the reunion, which will raise funds for <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When we have a dinner where former bunnies feel able to tell the truth, it will make a lot more money. And then I'll come,'' she said. But perhaps the feminist leader could strike a common chord with ex-bunny <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>, 37, who left her native <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> at 17 because `` they thought I was pretty and too young to be involved in politics.'' `` It was a man's world _ it still is,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>, who went on to earn a degree in international relations at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> and open an import business. Before that, she worked from 1968 to 1971 in the old <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> club, which closed in 1982. `` I was brought up in a convent,'' she explained. `` I wanted to get a job where I would n't be so shy anymore.'' She said a club manager's advice to stand tall and be proud of herself `` did more for me than a psychiatrist could have done.'' <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Muscara </PERSON>, 28, rode the cottontail of the era. Her employer, the <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, opened in November 1985 and closed in June 1986. Miss <PERSON> Muscara </PERSON>, director of sales for a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> computer maintenance company, hurried from her office three nights a week, trading her business clothes for a bunny costume. `` It was a release. I could n't wait to walk into the bunny room,'' she said. `` It got me through the day sometimes.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON> said she organized the reunion of ex-bunnies who live in the metropolitan area at the suggestion of her 13-year-old son. `` Years ago, we were teen-agers _ young and foolish,'' she said. `` Now, we've lived life, matured.'' `` Some are bringing up babies on their own. Most of my -LRB- ex-bunny -RRB- friends are in business; one is a doctor; one runs a shelter; they have gone on to do incredible things with their lives, for society,'' she added.

<HEAD>Dukakis Files State Financial Disclosure Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> filed state financial disclosure forms Friday that show, in addition to his $ 85,000 gubernatorial salary, three family trusts, stocks and a <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home. The Democratic presidential front-runner and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, own at least $ 1,000 in stock in <ORGANIZATION> Automatix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, company that makes industrial robots. The couple also owns at least $ 1,000 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury notes. The governor's home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> has a value of at least $ 100,000. Other than the interest earned from the trusts, the only family income reported on the financial disclosure forms required by state law stems from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' official salary. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a trustee, director or board member of several philanthropic and cultural groups, but she reported no income from them. The groups include the Wang Center for the Performing Arts, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a prison rehabilitation project and the Public Space Partnerships Project. The governor's disclosure form lists three trusts: one set up in 1974 by his father in the name of his wife and children; another created in 1949 under the will of <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' grandmother, <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, to be distributed to Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>; and one created in 1972 by <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. It was the trust set up in by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Panos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that drew attention last year when a report filed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> revealed that until 1986, the trust included stocks in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The trust was valued last year at $ 1 million. The <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> trust was valued at $ 50,000 as of last year, and the <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> trust $ 60,000. Up-to-date and detailed information on the trusts is expected to be available later this month when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled to file disclosure forms with the federal commission and to make public his 1987 income tax returns. The state disclosure forms do not require reporting precise incomes or values of assets. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reported no real estate transactions, mortgage holdings or loans on his state disclosure form.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned aside sharpened criticism from rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Friday and said it would be a `` tragedy'' if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoes legislation requiring companies to give notice before closing factories. He said workers `` deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on issues ranging from homelessness to problems with the nation's airlines under deregulation as he began campaigning toward <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s Democratic presidential primary next Tuesday. Campaigning on the one-year anniversary of his formal entry into the presidential race, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> urged supporters to ignore polls showing him far ahead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not mention his remaining Democratic rival, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, nor did he respond with criticism when asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s sharp comments in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would merely `` manage'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic program rather than change it `` I just do n't talk about these things _ I have a record,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` ... Not only that, I balance budgets, and that's something that has n't been a feature of Reaganomics. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> mentioned disagreements he has with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and other issues and said, `` I think you'll continue to see us conduct this campaign with a lot of mutual respect and genuine friendship, and the fact that we disagree on some issues I do n't think will change that.'' Appearing before labor leaders at a local union hall in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, and later before a lunchtime crowd in downtown <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor pointed to his own state's law requiring companies to make public their plans to close plants. He said it had saved jobs by giving workers and local governments the chance to prepare or find alternatives. `` I hope the president will take the time to think about the three million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers who lose their jobs in this country every year through plant shutdowns,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In at least half those cases, those plants shut down with little or no notice to those most affected _ their own employees. `` These people are our neighbors,'' he said. `` They deserve better from their employers. They deserve better from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he would veto trade legislation passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week because of a provision requiring 60-days' notice on plant closings. `` I hope he will reconsider,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Speaking to reporters later in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I think it would be a tragedy if it was vetoed. ... I think he might reconsider.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee after big wins in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, is battling <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s 159 Democratic delegates at stake Tuesday. After flying around <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Friday and Saturday, he also planned to visit <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where 79 delegates are also at stake in that state's primary Tuesday. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> released copies of letters sent to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders urging enactment of the trade bill and said he would make the bill a major part of his attack on Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, if the measure is vetoed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, who last year had flirted with the idea of running for the presidency. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> spoke warmly of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> but later said he was taking no stand in the race. `` It's a desire to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary in the state in which Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> knows he's as welcome as Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at every place, including the governor's office, and his supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in the fall,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not cite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name but referred to him in saying the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` is going to be asking Americans to keep things as they are. But I say we have to change.'' Repeating his call for reinvestment in American jobs, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I'm not running for president to overthrow governments in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I want to create jobs in middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Mariel Cuban Detainees Released</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Since the prison disturbances by Mariel Cuban detainees last fall, the government has released more than 1,000 of the detainees into halfway houses or with family sponsors in communities, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. One of the triggers to last year's uprisings at federal prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was the fact that the government was taking so long to place them in halfway houses once they were deemed eligible for release, according to legal advocates for the detainees. Federal officials said they were having trouble finding halfway house space for the detainees. From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in November, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had released 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots. Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the denials have been decided since the uprisings. When the riots broke out, there were about 7,600 Cuban detainees in various facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also announced it plans to repatriate 14 <ORGANIZATION> Mariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubans </ORGANIZATION>, the first group of detainees designated for return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> since the prison disturbances. The 14, in federal custody since completing prison sentences for crimes committed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been notified that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> intends to send them back, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Those in the group to be repatriated have been convicted of crimes including voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted rape. The repatriation process will include a review of their cases by a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review panel under an agreement which ended the rioting at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>. Those facing repatriation will be given the opportunity to submit additional information on their behalf to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review panels, which specifically exclude immigration officers.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> on Friday for discussing an espionage case in public last year, but stopped short of recommending disiplinary action against the <ORGANIZATION> Minnnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>. The committee said the remarks by <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, the immediate past chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had `` jeopardized the mutual confidence which must exist between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the intelligence community.'' `` The ethics committee has determined that your statements gave the appearance that you were disclosing sensitive national security information,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> was told. The Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation centered on comments <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> made at an event sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on March 15, 1987. Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were said to have been angered by <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s reported disclosure to the group that then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> in 1982 had `` changed the rules'' under which allies did not spy on each other by recruiting an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military officer to spy on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> later denied he had revealed any classified information. In its letter to <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Because the committee has concluded that your actions were not intentional, deliberate, nor attended with gross negligence, and because of the particular facts of this case, we will not recommend that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> take institutional action against you. However, the committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your actions.'' The letter was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said Friday he was `` gratified by their findings that no action is warranted But he added: `` I respectfully disagree with the ethic committee's conclusion that my statements gave an appearance that may have put at risk the mutual confidence that must exist between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the intelligence community.'' Sources present at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> meeting who said they took careful notes reported that <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruited its Israeli spy after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The spy passed along sensitive information about the invasion, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> reportedly told the group. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s comments were said to be aimed at giving context to the case of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, an American convicted of spying on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In a statement issued later, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said he had not been seeking to justify <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s recruitment of <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, but `` rather to shed light on how it may have occurred'' and give it `` perspective.'' In his statement Friday, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> repeated his previous assertions that he had not disclosed anything classified, but was only referring to newspaper accounts at the time whose content led to speculation that there may have been <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources in the Israeli government. `` I believe that I exercised due care in preparation for this speech,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said. `` I respectfully disagree with the ethic committee's conclusion that my statements gave the appearance that I was disclosing sensitive information.'' `` To the contrary, I expressly indicated that the source of my remarks was newspaper articles, and I said nothing to leave the impression that I was relaying confidential information,'' he said. `` Director <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was a strong leader, loyal to his own view of the public interest, but his belief that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should play little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual confidence long before March 1987,'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said. In a separate statement Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> `` was an excellent chairman during one of the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight I had just as much confidence in <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> examination as I do right now.''

<HEAD>Chemical Plant Partially Closed As Public Health Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities on Friday shut down some production facilities at a chemical plant in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> after environmentalists contended the equipment increased cases of cancer and other diseases. Soviet television said two units producing chloroprene rubber were taken out of production Friday morning at the <ORGANIZATION> Nairit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> because they caused `` irreparable harm to the city's ecology and people's health.'' The decision was made due to `` multiple demands of residents of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> about a complicated ecological situation,'' an announcer said. A correspondent for the television news program Vremya reported from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that the two units sent 3,500 tons of pollutants into the air annually. The report showed workers turning off valves on the units, built in the late 1930s. The plant will continue to produce other items, including anti-corrosive paint, according to the report. The shutdown was an example of how Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, has made authorities more responsive to citizens' complaints. The Soviet news media has carried a number of reports about industrial pollution as a threat to public health. Many cities are reported to be in violation of national air pollution standards. In January, the government formed a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>. At least 3,000 Armenians marched in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Oct. 17 to demand the shutdown of <LOCATION> Nairit </LOCATION> and a nuclear power station. Soviet television said the national Cabinet, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, in December ordered an end to production of chloroprene at Nairit using old technology. In March 1986, activists in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> sent <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a petition demanding that the plant be relocated. They said it was contributing to a massive increase in stomach cancer, cardiac and respiratory disease and congenital defects. They claimed that over the past 15 years the number of leukemia cases in and around <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> quadrupled.

<HEAD>Mayor: City Has the Money, But Squabble Stalls Payroll Checks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> said Friday that his cash-strapped city has come up with the money for its biweekly payroll, but that workers still wo n't get paid on time because of a City Hall squabble. City Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, whose elective job includes authority to sign city payroll checks, posted a brief note Friday afternoon advising city workers that they would not receive their checks until Monday. Friday was payday. On Thursday, she had said that city coffers were about $ 70,000 short of meeting the $ 230,000 payroll. But Officer charged that the city had the money on Friday and said Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was withholding the money deliberately. `` This is a case of protest by the city treasurer because of recent layoffs in her office,'' Officer said in a telephone interview. Twenty-five of the approximately 275 city workers were laid off Monday _ including all of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s regular staff _ and the city expects to cut another 25 in the next week or two, Comptroller <PERSON> LaMar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not return numerous telephone calls to her office Friday. Officer said he also had tried unsuccessfully to reach her. `` She's the most wanted person in town right now,'' Officer said, adding he had heard many complaints from city workers. The withholding of the paychecks `` does n't make any sense, especially when you have over a half a million dollars in cash in the bank.'' Officer said Friday that the money had been transferred from other accounts _ mostly revenues collected for the city by the state or county _ in plenty of time to cover the paychecks. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> agreed with the mayor's charge that the payroll shortage was trumped up by Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> because of the layoffs. `` There is no problem with the payroll, only in the treasurer's eyes,'' he said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> has been on a financial roller coaster for decades. Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive some kind of public assistance and about 40 percent of its citizens are unemployed. Officials say the depressed city's financial problems show no sign of subsiding. On May 17 _ two days after its next payroll is due _ the city must make a $ 54,000 payment on a court judgment it owes a <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeBow </PERSON> was seriously injured in a 1985 beating at the city jail. Attorneys for his family last month obtained a temporary freeze of the city's assets to force payment of the settlement, which totals about $ 4 million. But <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said he expects the city to be able to cover its upcoming payrolls and the payments on the DeBow judgment by shuffling funds around in the `` day-by-day, week-by-week process'' of trying to keep the city afloat. `` I've been doing it -LRB- the comptroller's job -RRB- since'84 and we have n't missed one -LRB- payroll -RRB-, but we've had to do some juggling acts,'' he said. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> also said the city was in no greater danger of bankruptcy Friday than it was four years earlier.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced a nationwide recall of one-ounce bottles of Humco brand ipecac syrup because some bottles instead contained toxic eucalyptus oil. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> urged parents to check medicine cabinets for the product and said no parent should administer the product, which is used to induce vomiting after a poisoning. Immediate medical help should be obtained if eucalyptus oil is swallowed, he said. Eucalyptus oil can be extremely dangerous if ingested, causing epigastric burning, nausea, vomiting, convulsions and coma. As little as a teaspoon of the oil can cause death. It normally is used in minute amounts for vaporizers or in products such as nose drops. All bottles should be returned to their place of purchase, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The manufacturer, Humco Laboratory of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, undertook the recall Friday after <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> reported to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> that seven bottles labeled as ipecac had been found to instead contain eucalyptus oil. The recall includes all lots of Humco brand ipecac syrup. The bottles have screw-on caps. It is the second recall of ipecac syrup within the past week due to a labeling mix-up.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's top counter-terrorism expert on Friday predicted a probable surge in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorism as a result of the uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the killing of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla chieftain. Ambassador <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> continues to plan international terrorist attacks, but is looking for such surrogates as the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> `` to do its dirty work.'' In an interview, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said, `` There is a possibility of a measurable increase of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorism'' in the coming months. He cited as reasons the five-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the killing of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The killing of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was carried out by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> almost two weeks ago. The rapprochement between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> following <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>'s assassination also may contribute to a terror campaign, although it is too soon to assess the impact of the thaw, he said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, the nom de guerre for <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannah </PERSON>, continues to plan terror attacks from his headquarters in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> where he maintains 300 to 400 operatives, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> heads a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> faction which broke away from the <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and which has carried out some of the bloodiest terror attacks in the world over the past few years. The organization also maintains eight training camps in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, in an attempt to win <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, expelled <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> last summer. But <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said the group's presence in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is a continued irritant in U.S.-Syrian relations. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> operatives were apprehended in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> over the past six months, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who asked not to be named. Also in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has links with the Filipino Moro guerrilla group on the southern island of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION>, he said. Several minor bombings in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> over the last few months may have been the work of <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, said the official. Having been intimidated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> two years ago, Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has been `` casting about looking for surrogates'' to carry out terror attacks, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. Among the candidates are <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is believed to have shipped the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> hundreds of tons of Soviet-made weapons over the past three years. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also `` sent out feelers'' to the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, he said. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for a bombing earlier this month at a USO club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicewoman was killed. <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> noted that the attack was carried out a day before the April 15 second anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. He also said a Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member was caught April 12 by state troopers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> with two bombs in his car. The man is not cooperating with police, but he may have planned to use the bombs on the anniversary date, <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON> said. In general, terror attacks in 1987 rose by 5.9 percent over the 1985 record _ from 785 to 832, according to figures compiled by <PERSON> Bremer </PERSON>'s office. The increase reflects the surge in bombing attacks in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, most of which are attributed to the Soviet-backed Afghan secret police. After <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is the second largest sponsor of international terrorism, with 40 attacks to its name in 1987, compared with 34 in 1985, according to the figures.

 Eight of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 member nations tentatively agreed early Saturday to a small cut in oil production for May and June in an effort to prop up sagging prices, cartel leaders said. <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON>, the Iranian oil minister, told reporters <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> `` reserved their position'' until <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s next meeting, which he said was set for Saturday night. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has not joined <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s existing production-sharing system, was not expected to particiopate in the proposed new cuts, said Venezuelan Oil Minister <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the proposal was made by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. `` This proposal had the support of eight countries,'' he said. The four gulf Arab oil ministers were to consult with their governments and report a final decision at the next session, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> told reporters. The production cuts would take effect May 1. It was not immediately clear how the proposed cut of 300,000 barrels a day, if adopted, would be divided among the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The proposal calls for oil export cuts by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with a group of independent oil producers. The non-OPEC group was invited to discuss strategy at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> earlier this week. The aim is to raise prices to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a barrel, from the current range of $ 14 to $ 16, by tightening supplies. Nervous traders sent oil prices lower on European markets, where Brent crude oil from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> tumbled 66 cents, to $ 16.54 a 42-gallon barrel, after having lost 30 cents on Thursday. Later, prices continued slumping at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dropping as much as 43 cents per barrel before rallying toward the close and ending largely unchanged, analysts said. June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled at $ 17.99 per barrel, up 1 cent from Thursday. The non-OPEC group, comprised of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, on Tuesday offered to reduce their oil exports by 5 percent if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> did likewise. The cuts would be for May and June only. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders initially welcomed the offer, which marked the first such proposal from a group of outside oil producers since <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1960. Some called it a historic first step toward creating a global oil alliance. Once the cartel leaders sat down to discuss the proposal, however, sharp differences emerged, officials said after an initial session that ended early Friday. The early discussions focused on whether supplies were far enough out of balance with demand to require a cut in production, said <PERSON> Fernandos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s oil minister. In an attempt to resolve this question, a team of technical experts from the 13 cartel member countries met Friday afternoon. The experts group failed to reach a unified view, however a majority of the experts said some form of additional production restraint was needed in order to get prices higher, according to sources speaking privately. Saudi King Fahd appeared to signal on Thursday that he would not accept any further reductions in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production. He said prices would go up if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> simply stuck to its existing output quotas, which often are violated. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest oil producer, injected added tension into the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks with its decision Tuesday to break diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, citing what it called a hostile Iranian attitude. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, fighting a 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, has attacked neutral shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, including Saudi ships, in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks on Iranian-chartered ships in the waterway

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered a close inspection of the upper skin of older-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s last October because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap, warning such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression. The twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that ripped open at 24,000 feet was among the early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s subject to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive as well as to a series of service bulletins by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> outlining the inspection programs, officials said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s concern had been raised last year because routine inspections turned up cracks near fasteners that join sections of sheet metal in three aircraft. The same inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s because the lamination was no longer holding. <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, manager of public relations for <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, said Friday, `` We are in full compliance with the October directive. We did receive the directive, the inspections were carried out and we are in compliance.'' She would not elaborate on what the inspections revealed, but said nothing was found that caused alarm. Investigators have yet to determine the cause of Thursday's incident in which a huge upper section of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jetliner tore away, leaving passengers exposed to the open skies at 24,000 feet The pilot made an emergency landing within 15 minutes, but a flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 60 passengers were injured, two critically. Sources who asked not to be identified said that investigators are focusing on a possible structural failure that could have caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin. One theory is that a structural failure such as a tear in the cabin skin might have caused an initial loss of cabin pressure and then the force of the strong winds may have ripped away the huge upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front entry door to within a few feet of the wing. Investigators, however, also are examining the cabin pressurization system to determine whether it might have malfunctioned. The airworthiness directive issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> last Oct. 5 required that operators of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s inspect the extreme upper sections of the planes' outer skin from just behind the front entry door to the tail section for cracks and metal strips that may be coming loose. `` Failure to detect and repair cracks could result in rapid depressurization of the airplane,'' the directive warned. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that the manufacturer has issued a series of service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections on the aircraft skin of the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s for possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion. The last bulletin was issued two weeks before Thursday's incident, he said Unlike <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directives, the bulletins from the manufacturer do not require mandatory compliance. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive last October also outlined a detailed schedule of future periodic inspections to protect against cracks or loosening of metal strips which reinforce the fuselage where sections of sheet metal overlap. The directive covered the first 291 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s manufactured. Later aircraft had a stronger bonding and fastening system for the sheet metal and were not the subject of concern, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has built 1,109 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 series aircraft such as the one involved in Thursday's incident. According to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> plane involved in Thursday's incident was No 152 off the assembly line. It was delivered to a leasing company in April 1968 and leased to <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> in December of that year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records showed that the plane had extensive repair work done to mend cracks and corroded metal on two occasions in 1983, but most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the plane which seemed not to be related to Thursday's incident. Extensive work also was required in 1983 and several other times since then on cracks and corrosion on the plane's wings, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records. A section of the plane's right wing was replaced last year when cracks were found in the wing. Many of those repairs were required by another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive in 1982 which stemmed in part from an investigation into the 1981 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> which had similarities to the incident Thursday in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, according to aviation experts. On Aug. 22, 1981, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> crashed after the top of the cabin's metal skin tore from the plane at about 22,000 feet. In both the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accidents, about the same section of the plane ripped away. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an aviation consultant familiar with the 1981 crash, said a big difference was that in the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> accident the structural weakness was linked to corrosion in the forward baggage compartment below the cabin floor. In Thursday's incident, however, the Aloha jet remained intact below the cabin floor and the control cables were not damaged, allowing the pilot to maintain control and bring the jet in for a safe landing.

<HEAD>Cuban Art Official Refusing To Quit Over Auction Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A museum official, under fire from Cuban exiles for including in an auction works by artists they consider sympathetic to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government, accused his detractors of using the type of totalitarian tactics they oppose. `` I have been subject to extreme pressure,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Culture. <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> has ignored requests to resign, though he says he has received so many threatening telephone calls that he had to have his phone number changed. The flap began over an April 22 auction that earned the museum $ 50,000 in commissions from the auction of 173 paintings by various Cuban artists, some of whom live or lived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and some of whom live elsewhere. Some of the works were by artists considered by the strongly anti-Communist Cuban exile community to be sympathetic to <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. The privately funded museum's governing board of directors, which had narrowly approved the auction, met in emergency session Friday to discuss the dispute, but there was no immediate word on whether the board would announce any decision. <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> said he would resign only if the 54-member board asked him to do so. Mignon <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON>, a museum founder and its former president, is among those accusing <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> of tinkering with the museum's ideological slant in what <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON> considers a misguided pursuit of artistic freedom `` We are a museum created and sustained by Cuban exiles,'' <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON> said. `` As long as we have a voice, we will never be a propaganda vehicle for those artists who collaborate with the communists.'' Museum president <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mainieri </PERSON>, who says he has asked <PERSON> Cernuda </PERSON> to quit because of the flap, has also canceled a planned showing next month of work by Cuban artist <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON>. One of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s foremost painters, she died on the island in 1986 She recently has been accused by some anti-Castro activists as a collaborator of that government. That accusation is absurd, said art expert <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez-Sicre </PERSON>, founder of the modern art museum at the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` They're imbeciles when they say that. She was the best painter we ever produced,'' he said. `` She never got involved in politics. All she had to do was paint.'' The artist's 85-year-old sister, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, also denied the collaboration charge. `` She has n't been a collaborator of any government, much less this one,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` She just painted and painted and painted.''

<HEAD>Two Accused of Smuggling Pelts Of Endangered Animals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former candidate for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the husband of a former state revenue commissioner have been indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> for allegedly smuggling the pelts of endangered animals into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The grand jury issued a 14-count indictment Thursday against two wealthy physicians, Dr. <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampers </PERSON>, who has homes in <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>; and Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> of Lyndeborough, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION> Hampers is the husband of former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Revenue Commissioner <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> finished fourth in the Republican primary for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in 1980. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said Friday that the endangered animals, which were hunted in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, were two ocelots, a mountain lion and two jaguars. It is legal to kill jaguars and ocelots in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with proper permits, but it is illegal to return them to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ocelot and the jaguar are on the endangered species list. The mountain lion is on the protected species list. `` If the reports are true, it shows a shocking insensitivity to these endangered species which can not be countenanced,'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, a lawyer for Hampers, said his client `` maintains his innocence. He will enter a plea of not guilty and expects to be vindicated at the end of trial.'' <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>'s home and office have unlisted telephone numbers, and he could not be reached for comment Friday evening. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s office reportedly obtained search warrants for Hampers' and <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>'s homes and offices and confiscated three mounted ocelots, two jaguars and a mountain lion. Chief Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney L.J. <PERSON> O'Neale </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> said the trophies will be used as evidence. Hampers founded <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, a Waltham-based company that was a pioneer in the artificial kidney field. His wife, who was revenue commissioner in 1979-82, ran unsuccessfully against <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> two years ago. <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> is a former president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Hampers and <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> each is charged with two counts of conspiracy to smuggle wildlife, two counts of smuggling, six counts of illegal importation of wildlife and four counts of unlawful transportation of wildlife. If convicted, they could be sentenced to five years in prison and fined $ 100,000 each. The indictment said Hampers and <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> knew they were acting illegally when they paid <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a Mexican national who was their hunting guide, to bring the pelts into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Hampers and <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> allegedly arranged to have the pelts stuffed by a taxidermist in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, who sent the mounted trophies to the men's homes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The indictment charges that <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> met the men in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to deliver the pelts. The taxidermist, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensley </PERSON>, reportedly cooperated with authorities, allowing his telephone calls with Hampers and <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> to be recorded by federal agents.

<DATELINE>KAHULUI, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Passengers on Friday praised the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot who safely brought down a jetliner blown open at 24,000 feet, with one man saying the landing was `` just like riding in a Cadillac.'' `` It came down so smooth, it was better than a regular landing,'' said <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagihara </PERSON>, who had thought the plane was going to crash Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, piloted by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, landed at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 15 to 20 feet of its upper fuselage _ just behind the front passenger door _ torn away to the floor. Witnesses said one engine was on fire. One attendant apparently was sucked from the cabin to her death, and 61 people were injured, two critically. `` I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 40, one of 89 passengers aboard Flight 243 from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. A structural failure is suspected of having caused the cabin to blow open. Investigators have ruled out a bomb blast, sources said. Schornstheimer, a 42-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot, realized there was a hole in fuselage but was not aware of the extent of the damage until after the landing, said his father, also named <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. `` He says it was just something else _ all of a sudden there was this noise, and the plane's flying funny and there's a big drag on it, so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport, which was closest, and he was able to get it in and land it,'' the elder Schornstheimer father said from his home in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The pilot was taken to an undisclosed location by <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> for questioning by investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> telephoned and congratulated him for the landing, said a spokesman for the department. `` Because the upper structure was gone, there was a possibility of the plane buckling,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bringelson </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeromotive </ORGANIZATION>, who watched the landing from his company hangar at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` If he had n't been real careful, it could have busted in two. The man was highly skilled and it speaks well of the profession.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberly </PERSON>, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he and a friend dropped to their knees as they saw the plane land, its cabin exposed. The jetliner was weaving as it headed in, he said. `` You could tell his plane was on one engine,'' <PERSON> Eberly </PERSON> said. `` One engine was on fire and smoking.'' `` I have to give the pilot credit. He brought it in good,'' <PERSON> Eberly </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't believe the airplane was still flying or that people sitting in that area survived,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> pilot who has flown 737s for 20 years. `` I think it's a statement probably any pilot would make looking at it. I just think that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> did a wonderful job.'' The elder <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said his son sounded calm when they spoke by telephone Thursday night. `` He's pretty calm under pressure. He said he was calm and did what needed to be done, just like any other pilot would have. They were talking about it on TV like -LRB- he was a hero -RRB-, but he said he just did what any other pilot would have done in the same circumstance,'' the father said.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet official on Friday criticized <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the issue would be discussed at the superpower summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> told a news conference the action by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> diminished the significance of last year's U.S.-Soviet pact to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers agreed at their Nuclear Planning Group meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Thursday to develop a replacement for the short-range Lance missile and a new air-launched missile for bombers. <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> decision serious and said, `` We are against modernization. We want to reduce the level of nuclear and other armaments and not to raise it.'' He was asked if the issue was serious enough to be discussed at the May 29-June 3 meeting of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and replied: `` They have to discuss this problem. It's one of the key problems of the situation. `` As soon as we have some result in reducing arms, immediately there is a tendency _ and it's a negative tendency _ to try to compensate, to try not to give the full development to this disarmament tendency.'' <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> said it was a `` rather interesting coincidence'' that in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> asserted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was conducting tests to shorten the range of some intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- ICBMs -RRB-, so they could be targeted towards <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and then <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreed to develop new missiles. He said: `` Let's consider for a moment that the Americans are right and we are making ICBMs to hit targets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, although experts would say this is absolute nonsense, ... why not appeal to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to demand clarification, to discuss this situation? `` No, at the moment the news breaks out, the decision has been adopted -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> said he still hoped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators would reach agreement on cutting long-range nuclear missiles by 50 percent before the summit. `` If we fail in climbing this mountain, then the task would be to go as high as possible on the way toward the top and to create a situation which would make it impossible to go back,'' he said. `` We are working in this direction ... There are very serious and large efforts on our side to make this agreement a reality.'' He added the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be `` a little bit more persistent'' in trying to resolve outstanding issues, and listed as examples a ceiling on sea-launched missiles and a verification system. Both sides have agreed to those points, he said, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has not specified a ceiling or responded to Soviet proposals on verification. In the case of ICBMs and submarine-launched missiles, <PERSON> Adamishin </PERSON> said `` there is more or less a clear picture emerging as to how the agreement would work.'' But with sea-launched cruise missiles and some other weapons where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` a considerable superiority over us'' there is no agreement, he said. He did not specify what other weapons he was referring to.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday cleared one of its former prosecutors, best-selling novelist <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>, of allegations that he may have obstructed justice in a criminal investigation. The allegations were contained in a federal appeals court opinion which raised ethical and legal questions over the fact that <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>, while an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the early 1980s, used a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his own client. <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>, who wrote the book `` Presumed Innocent'' about a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> prosecutor falsely accused of murder, `` did not hinder or obstruct the administration of justice in any way,'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON> wrote in a one-page letter to <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>'s attorney. All decisions by <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> were approved by his supervisors and `` there is no evidence that any of the actions taken by Mr. <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> or his superiors violated any federal criminal statute,'' said <PERSON> Keeney </PERSON>, the acting criminal division chief in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> said in a statement that he was gratified by the decision. `` As I have said from the outset, I am convinced that the conduct in question was proper, and necessary for effective law enforcement,'' he said. The public integrity probe was launched after the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> refused to dismiss a drug case in which <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> was marginally involved as a prosecutor. Federal agents arrested a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> man after finding more than 4 pounds of cocaine in his house, and the man retained two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyers, one of whom later became a target in `` Operation Greylord,'' an investigation of corruption in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Ill. The target, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, contacted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and offered to provide drug-related information in exchange for favorable treatment of his case. His offer was accepted and he met periodically with <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>. When Glass informed <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> he was representing the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON>, in the drug case, <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> encouraged him to proceed as an informant and <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> obtained permission to place a microphone on Glass to secretly record conversations between him and <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON>, according to the federal appeals court. <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> warned him not to reveal any privileged attorney-client conversations. When <PERSON> Ofshe </PERSON> and his other lawyer discovered that Glass had been acting as an informant, they tried unsuccessfully to have the case dismissed. The appeals court rejected the request for dismissal last June, but said that `` we do not condone the government's use of criminal defense attorneys as informants against their clients.'' Last November, a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>'s request to delete from the record its previous rebuke, saying it was troubled by `` the ethical ramifications'' of his conduct and that `` we believe that <PERSON> Turow </PERSON> may have committed an obstruction of justice.

<TEXT>
 Scientists from around the globe gathered Friday to plan for International Space Year in 1992 and were called the spiritual descendants of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>. `` You are explorers who know of enduring hardship ... to triumph over great natural obstacles,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-ISY </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is supervising the planning. The organization is orchestrating a series of space projects to commemorate the 500th anniversary of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' first voyage to the New World in 1492. `` This effort unites the universal themes ... that have powered the human spirit in the past and continue to point to a future of unlimited horizons,'' added <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly 90 scientists from 17 space agencies, including those of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and Western European, opened the three-day meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>. The scientists are planning projects that will use space satellites to research global problems including acid rain, ozone depletion and the apparent gradual warming of the Earth's climate, known as the greenhouse effect. Images of the planet from space, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said, have `` triggered an awareness of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as a fragile and most precious life support system, one made even more precious because ... it is the only body in our solar system to harbor and nourish life.'' The space year will include TV specials, expositions and trade fairs. The events will help persuade people and governments that space technology is worth its high cost, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of several western European nations. `` It's easy to convince the public and political masters of the glamor projects like space travel ... but harder to maintain the enthusiasm and funding levels for the long period needed to observe Earth,'' <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Survey: 4 Out Of 10 American Professionals Say Japan's Economy

<TEXT>
 Four out of every 10 American professionals surveyed believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic power is a threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and only 1 percent said U.S.-Japanese relations are very good, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The survey involved 1,550 politicians, lawyers and other professionals and indicated most believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has failed to fulfill its international responsibilities commensurate with its stature as an economic power, said the report released Thursday. The survey, widely carried in Japanese newspapers Friday, was conducted by the U.S.-based Gallup Organization for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The professionals were selected randomly from `` Who's Who in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Asked if they considered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s growing economic power to be a benefit or threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 40 percent of the respondents said it was a threat, up from 37 percent in 1987 and the highest level since the Foreign Ministry began the annual poll of prominent Americans in 1972. About 47 percent said they thought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s growing economic strength benefited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from 52 percent last year and a record low, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. About 70 percent of respondents said they felt Japanese high technology presented a serious challenge to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Only about 1 percent said they felt relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were `` very good,'' while about 35 percent rated them as `` good,'' 52 percent said they were `` normal'' and 11 percent called them `` not good.'' The survey showed 61 percent of those questioned believe <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has done `` nothing at all'' to assume its share of world responsibilities, despite its strong economic performance. Twenty-eight percent said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has assumed its due duties `` to some extent.'' Only eight percent of the respondents said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has `` fully'' played up to its role as the second largest economic power in the Western world after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the report. It said those who considered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> an important country for `` the development and stability of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region'' totaled 43 percent, up from 41 percent in the 1987 survey. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> took second place with 35 percent of those surveyed in the poll. Regarding agricultural trade, 25 percent said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should immediately open up its markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products, up eight points from 1987. Fifty-eight percent said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should disband its farm market barriers on a gradual basis.

 The rebels on Friday removed a major obstacle to agreement in their talks with the government to work out details of a cease-fire pact signed last month. The top rebel leader announced that the insurgents, known as Contras, will not insist that their fighters be resupplied with weapons and ammunition when they gather in seven cease-fire zones during a permanent truce that is being considered. `` We have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty and indivisibility of national territory,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> told a news conference. Previously the Contras insisted that the cease-fire zones be autonomous. But <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> also said the Contras rejected the Sandinista government's demand that all humanitarian aid to the rebels be channeled through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The rebels expect $ 17.7 million in humanitarian aid already approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> told reporters earlier Friday that the rebels have suffered deep internal divisions and some segments have rejected disarming and returning to civilian life. The rebels on Friday rejected a government proposal to extend by 30 days a 60-day cease-fire that began April 1. They said the extension showed `` a lack of good will to fulfill the agreements.'' The cease-fire agreement was signed on March 23. Sandinista officials said the rebel refusal to agree to an extension showed the Contras were more interested in a truce than a permanent peace. The interim cease-fire accord calls for the Contras to move into cease-fire zones while talks continue on a long-term accord. Contra leaders insist the sides agree upon just how much freedom the rebels will have within those zones. As the two sides continued their talks in the Nicaraguan capital, police used rubber truncheons to break up a demonstration at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for anti-Sandinista unions, and detained seven people. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Huembes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinate </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of unions and parties opposed to the government, said four workers were arrested outside the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He said they were en route to the demonstration in front of the confederation building. Both the construction workers and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> belong to the coordinate. The arrests came five days after 38 construction workers and auto mechanics began a hunger strike for higher salaries. Police cordoned off the entrance of the union headquarters where about 150 people, including the hunger strikers, huddled behind the metal grates of the building. A banner strung across the building said: `` We prefer to die of hunger fighting with dignity than to die working as slaves.'' About 1,500 workers from both industries have staged wildcat strikes since Feb. 25 demanding higher wages. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, head of privately-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcast the news of the police actions, said Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> punched him in the mouth when he was summoned to the minister's office on Friday. He said <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> apologized later. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> is also a leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a private watchdog group. The weapons issue has been a major one in the Contra-Sandinista talks, particularly whether the rebels can keep their arms. The rebels say they will disarm when <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is on the `` irreversible road to democracy.'' The Sandinistas say disarming is fundamental to the pact. But <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said an apparent split among Contra leaders made such negotiations more difficult. The rebels deny the split. The rebels had been supplied arms and weapons since 1981 through CIA-operated air drops that stopped earlier this year when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for renewed military aid. Government newspapers on Friday quoted President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> as saying that $ 17.9 million in U.S.-approved aid for children orphaned or injured in the war would be permitted only if channeled through neutral organizations. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was quoted as saying his side understood the `` good intentions'' involved in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' approving the money, `` but we can not allow it to arrive through political organisms that are clearly against the revolution.'' The aid, part of a nearly $ 48 million Contra aid package, was to be funneled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>.

 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> on Friday named <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> their candidate in next year's presidential elections, ignoring warnings that the party may split. The party chief and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister was acclaimed by an overwhelming majority of the delegates in a raucous congress punctuated by insults and derisive whistles. No other name was proposed. Supporters of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>' bitter rival in the centrist party fight, boycotted the nominating <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, claiming it was stacked in favor of <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prendes </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the party's honorary president, did not attend. He had urged both <ORGANIZATION> Rey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prendes </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> to step aside and let <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, an elderly party leader, be the unity candidate. Both candidates rejected that suggestion. Under law, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> could not run for a second five-year term. He won the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the U.S.-supported conservative government that began in 1980 and continues. The number of delegates eligible to vote was 1,099. Some had left the Sheraton Hotel auditorium by the time the vote was taken, but hundreds of delegates raised their credentials when <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>' name was put to the vote. Those opposed, including some of the party's top leaders, mustered only 56 votes in favor of postponing the decision on a candidate. The National Convention comprising about 180 delegates later unanimously ratified <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>' nomination. `` If this congress makes a decision today, this party is not going to divide, it is going to shatter,'' said <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a member of the party's 10-member Political Committee, or directorate. He is the minister of commerce and the president's nephew He and three other committee members urged delaying a decision to give party leaders time to heal deep rifts caused by the rivalry. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viera </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> were dooming themselves to defeat in the March election. He was booed as he warned, `` If we make this decision and the party splits, the people will not have a democratic option in the presidential election.'' The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, defeated the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> last month in legislative and municipal elections, putting <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> in a good position to win the presidential election. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>'s detractors accuse it of being authoritarian. The party rejects the charge, likening its ideology to that of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Republicans. Arena will choose its presidential candidate in September. When <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, a wealthy businessman and full-time politician, mounted the podium to accept the nomination, most of those who had supported postponement walked out. `` I'm sure that once tempers cool, we'll all be together again in the struggle,'' <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> told the delegates. `` Let the anger end today.'' `` My arms are open. There is no need to exclude anyone,'' he said in what was taken as a reference to <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacayo </PERSON>, a Political Committee member, predicted <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> would try to have the congress and convention annulled. <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prendes </LOCATION> controls most of the party bureaucracy. He is a former minister of communications, former mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a member of the Political Committee. He and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> helped found the party in 1960.

 A 10-year-old girl hit by a car that careened across a crowded schoolyard died Friday, bringing the death toll from the accident to three. A 4-year-old and a woman waiting for her grandchildren were killed Thursday in the accident at the <ORGANIZATION> Cyrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Seven other children were injured. On Friday, grieving children and teachers gathered quietly at the school. Many of the 800 students stayed home, said kindergarten teacher <PERSON> Argelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, tearful as she hugged a parent on the sidewalk before classes began. `` We are very sorry. We do n't know what to think. It's horrible,'' she said `` It was awful. I did n't even want to come to school today. I thought the car would still be there,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Galarza </PERSON>, 12, a sixth-grader. <PERSON> Galarza </PERSON> said he saw the accident that occurred just after the school bell signaled the end of classes. A woman's car jumped the curb, crashed through a chain-link fence and slammed into the entrance of an annex as children were leaving. `` I seen the lady fly up in the air when the car hit her,'' the boy said, adding he watched <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and others lift the car to free people trapped underneath. The third person fatally injured in the accident, 10-year-old <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Moya </PERSON>, who had suffered head and chest injuries, died at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> Friday afternoon, said night administrator <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>. Six other children, ages 5 to 9, remained hospitalized Friday in good or fair condition, while a 29-year-old woman who was at the school to pick up her son was treated and released Thursday. The driver of the car, <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, 37, was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and negligent driving, according to Police Officer <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>. She was released after posting $ 100 cash bond and her driver's license. Police said they believe Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON> was driving above the 20 mph speed limit. There was no evidence of intoxication or other drug use, they said. An examination of the car revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunction, Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said Friday. `` It's apparent driver error,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, said the facts in the case would emerge eventually, but declined further comment. Eighth-grader <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON>, 15, whose younger cousin attends the school, was waiting there for his bus as usual Friday morning. `` It feels like a nasty nightmare. The little kids _ they're all scared,'' he said. Third-grade teacher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, who helped pull people from underneath the car, said he himself was grieving as he contemplated trying to help youngsters get over the trauma. `` You do the best job you can,'' he said. `` You're not God and you ca n't bring them back and heal them.'' The dead woman was identified as <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, between 60 and 65, who suffered severe leg injuries, said <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Diann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, whose grandchildren attended the school, `` waits there every day faithfully to make sure her kids get home safety.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed Friday making employers put warning tags or locks on machinery as it is being cleaned or serviced _ nine years after unions requested the regulation and more than 1,000 deaths later as a result of its absence. The proposed regulations, which the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> estimates will save 122 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries annually, had languished at the White House for nearly a year. Their publication in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> on Friday occurred just one week after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., cited them in congressional hearings as an example of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` decision to let workers die while waiting on a standard. Employers under the proposal would have to adopt uniform procedures to `` lock out'' or `` tag out'' switches, valves or other controls to prevent the start up of machines while they are being cleaned or serviced. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated about 7 percent of all occupational fatalities and 2 per cent of accident-caused injuries in the workplace occur now because such equipment is inadvertently restarted while someone is working on it. `` This rule would mean safer working conditions for millions of employees in general industry,'' Assistant Labor Secretary and <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> said Friday. `` Very simple lockout, tagout measures, which take only a few minutes, can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries in some major manufacturing industries,'' <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON> said. The agency said the regulations will apply to some 1.6 million employers and cover an estimated 39 million workers at an estimated total annual cost of $ 135 million to businesses. They are aimed chiefly at machine operators and laborers who work around packaging and wrapping equipment, conveyors and printing presses, which are associated with the highest proportion of the accidents, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. As an example, the agency cited one worker who had leaned his head into a flour batch mixer and whose neck was crushed when another worker inadvertently turned the machine on. The so-called `` performance-oriented'' regulations would require employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and `` minimize'' the potential for inadvertently reactivating it. Unions that began petitioning the agency for the regulations in 1979 had wanted it to mandate as law specific procedures developed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. However, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said it would include the <ORGANIZATION> ANSI </ORGANIZATION> standards only as `` detailed voluntary guidelines'' in an appendix to the regulations. The agency noted that business groups had wanted the <ORGANIZATION> ANSI </ORGANIZATION> standards eliminated entirely from the appendix out of fears that a court might later interpret them as mandatory. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Molovich </PERSON>, a safety specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, predicted employers will ignore the voluntary guidelines and `` take the cheapest way out'' by using cardboard warning tags instead of locks to prevent a machine from being turned on. `` There will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment wo n't start,'' <PERSON> Molovich </PERSON> said of the proposed regulations. `` They would be better off cutting it into four-inch squares and putting it in the outhouse.'' The proposal also exempts millions of companies and workers in agriculture, oil and gas drilling, electric utilities, the maritime industry and construction. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials said protections for them will be included in other regulations to be proposed later. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> official who worked on the regulations for more than a decade, testified at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them back in 1977. But <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> took no serious action until 1979, when the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in related accidents the previous five years, formally asked the government for emergency action. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from other unions. And <PERSON> Scully </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that officials in the agency were taken off any work on them at all in 1981 and 1982. However, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> promised in 1983 to issue in 1984 what was published Friday. Copies of the agency's regulatory agenda showed similar promises in 1984, 1985 and 1986. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday that the proposed regulation was sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget in May 1987 for approval but was not acted on there until last month. The agency estimates it will be a minimum of another year before the regulations are actually enacted.

<HEAD>Fauci Praises Scientists, But Says Staff Shortages Have Delayed
Drug Trials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the federal agency researching AIDS drugs said Friday he is basically satisfied with the job scientists are doing, but acknowledged that some human trials have been delayed due to lack of money. Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on human resources that about 3,500 AIDS patients are involved in some 30 clinical trials financed with <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> grants. `` We're never satisfied, but we think we've done a pretty good job under the circumstances,'' <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said under questioning from Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the panel chairman, and other committee members. Pressed by <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> estimated that some trials of AIDS drugs that could have been started this year were delayed for a year, pending the new budget cycle, due to staff shortages. <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON> said that lack of personnel was `` almost exclusively'' the reason why still more experimental drugs have not yet entered clinical trials. He said his institute _ one arm of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> _ had requested 127 additional staff members for the current fiscal year, but had received only 11 new slots in the budget approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The dimension of the shortfall is such that you ca n't possibly meet your needs,'' concluded <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. A bill passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday would authorize up to 300 new full-time employees to work on AIDS at the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. However, the level of funds actually appropriated in any budget hinges on recommendations from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittees with jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>. Those panels, under overall budgetary constraints not imposed by congressional budgetary rules on committees with jurisdiction over authorizations, typically recommend lower levels. Those panels have yet to shape their recommendations on the <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> budget for fiscal 1989.

 Gov. Rose Mofford filed amended financial-disclosure forms Friday to cover transactions omitted from sworn documents she filed over the past 10 years, and she apologized for what she called an honest mistake. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was impeached and removed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, is under criminal indictment on charges of omitting a $ 350,000 campaign loan from his disclosure forms. Questions about Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s forms had been raised a week earlier by an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> story detailing discrepancies between her filings and other state and county records, and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> began an investigation Monday. Failure to file a complete disclosure statement can be a felony or a misdemeanor under <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law. The amended forms covered land, loan and partnership transactions omitted from earlier forms filed by Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>. `` I now believe that these items should have been disclosed earlier,'' she said at a news conference. `` I made an honest mistake.'' As secretary of state for 10 years before becoming governor upon <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was in charge of the office where disclosure forms are filed, and she said that aspect was especially embarrassing. `` I'm very sorry,'' she said. `` I want to emphasize that it was never my intent to hide anything from anybody.'' Asked how her position differed from that of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who said he made `` an honest mistake'' in failing to list the $ 350,000 loan and had not meant to hide anything, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> replied, `` Mine are very small amounts of money.'' As recently as Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> described reports about the undisclosed transactions as `` nitpicking.'' On Friday, however, she said was turning over 150 pages of documents about transactions to <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office together with copies of her income tax returns. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> declined to make her tax returns available to reporters but distributed some papers on all the properties, loans and partnerships the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> had cited. She also disclosed an interest in one additional partnership. `` On the investigation of the allegations against <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, I have no comment because the matter is under investigation,'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she had decided not to list the items because her interest in them was linked to T.R. Mofford, whom she divorced in 1967 but with whom she remained on good terms with until his death from cancer in 1982. She said that her former husband had given her an interest in a number of properties before his death and that she had paid his hospital bills `` in excess of $ 30,000.'' `` I have never made any profit,'' she said. `` I was paying my husband's bills.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and her aides acknowledged, however, that she had not listed her former husband's gifts under a reporting section that requires disclosure of gifts above $ 500 or, alternatively, listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a section covering amounts of more than $ 1,000 owed to or by the officeholder. `` Its a bad judgment call. I admit it. I'm sorry. I hope that I have n't embarrassed the state,'' she said. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> did not immediately return messages left at his home and office. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Puffer </PERSON>, founder of a group <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> supporters known as <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, said she saw little difference between Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s problems and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s, especially given Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s 10 years as head of the office that administers disclosure laws. `` You would hope that she would know them backwards and forwards,'' Ms. <PERSON> Puffer </PERSON> said. `` If anyone is in a position to know them, it would be her.'' `` It leaves a little doubt in my mind if she can handle the office _ how well prepared she is,'' she added.

Whether the Moslem guerrillas will revel in their rout of the Soviets or press on with the fight to oust President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and his Communist government is an open question. The patchwork of tribes and nationalities that joined forces, more or less, after the Communist coup in April 1978 have a much longer history of strife and infighting.

 A Soviet space shuttle, awaiting its first test flight, looks remarkably like a clone of its American predecessor, but there are significant differences. To start with, the maiden launch of the Russian vehicle will be unmanned. When the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle made its debut in 1981, two astronauts were at the controls. Other major differences: The main engines of the Soviet craft will be on the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> booster rocket instead of on the orbiter; the Soviet craft has jet engines that allow it greater maneuverability on landing and it may have an ejection escape capsule; the Soviets will not use solid-fuel booster rockets like the one that destroyed Challenger. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates, based on reconnaissance photos, show a Russian orbiter with dimensions that are within a few feet of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vehicle's. The length is calculated at 125.5 feet and the wingspan at 76 feet, compared with 122.2 feet and 78 feet. A 1986 report of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> showed side-by-side drawings of the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and the Soviet copy. Outwardly, they were identical down to the paint trim. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in its 1987 report on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military power, said, `` Soviet orbiter development has been heavily dependent on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orbiter propulsion, computer, materials and airframe design technology. `` By using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology and designs,'' the report said, `` the Soviets were able to produce an orbiter years earlier, and at far less cost, than if they had depended on their own technology. Money and scientific expertise could thus be diverted to other areas.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON>, head of the Soviet space agency <ORGANIZATION> Glavkosmos </ORGANIZATION>, said recently the Russian shuttle would be launched `` in the nearest future.'' `` We are now working quite energetically on testing on land, on the surface, of the components,'' he told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We are working literally around the clock.'' <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON> said the flight would be unmanned and computerized. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to fly its first shuttle with a crew reflected the confidence of the agency's design engineers that the orbiter would work the first time, but only if there were humans aboard. Flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required extensive alterations in the flight computer software so that the automatic pilot would respond to radio beacons along the route. With the program running three years behind schedule and with financial pressures rising, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> opted for a manned mission. Spacecraft in the earlier Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs underwent extensive unmanned testing before man was committed to fly them. The Soviet shuttle will be boosted by the new <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> superbooster, which can hoist a 220,000-pound payload into orbit, equaling the power of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s huge <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> 5 rocket that was scrapped after the Apollo moon-landing program. The huge rocket passed its first test-launching last May, but some small problems will have to be overcome on one or two more launchings before it can carry the shuttle. <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> has a central core fueled by hydrogen and four strap-on liquid-fuel rockets. Either the shuttle or an unmanned cargo vessel can be carried piggy-back on the rocket. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle has three main hydrogen engines that are part of the vehicle. They ignite at liftoff along with two solid-fuel rockets. A faulty solid-fuel rocket joint was blamed for the explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew members Jan. 28, 1986. A disadvantage of the Soviet design is that the engines are not reuseable because they are jettisoned after liftoff, while <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> uses shuttle engines repeatedly. An advantage of the design is that it permits the orbiter to lift more cargo, about 66,000 pounds, compared with about 55,000 for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle, and it provides for installation of landing engines. After descending from space, the American shuttle must fly a steep, high-speed final approach as a powerless glider. If it ever completed its re-entry without enough energy to reach the runway or were forced into an unsatisfactory final approach because of crosswinds or other factors, the crew would have to crash-land the vehicle. The jet engines of the Soviet craft would enable it to make its final approach at a safer, shallower angle. It would also allow more maneuvering flexibility in the event of a misalignment with the runway and permit a second go-around attempt if the first is unsatisfactory. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> considered the use of jet engines for landing, but cost and technical tradeoffs early in the program forced abandonment of the idea. Although there is no evidence in Soviet liturature, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> aerospace engineer and long-time observer of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> space program, believes the Soviet orbiter may have a blow-away escape capsule. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was fitted with two ejection seats, like those on jet fighter planes, for its first four test flights. But those missions had only two-man crews and when the number of astronauts per flight rose to as many as eight, it was not possible to provide escape systems for each. The existing two were then dropped. When American shuttle flights resume later this year, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that would allow the crew members to bail out if the spacecraft were making a bad landing approach and had to be ditched. The system includes a rapid blowout hatch and a telescoping pole that would enable the astronauts to slide past the potential hazard of striking the wing and then parachute to safety. The system would not help in a Challenger-like explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the Russians also are developing a small two-man reuseable spaceplane for swift access to orbit. At least five subscale models have been tested in orbit and the full craft is expected to make its first test flight about 1990. It would be boosted by a SL-X-16 rocket, smaller than <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, now undergoing testing. In its assessment of Soviet military power, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said this craft could be used for, among other things, `` reconnaissance missions, satellite repairs and maintenance, crew transport, space station defense, -LRB- and -RRB- satellite inspection.''

 <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> is organ transplantation's endearing wonder child, the first person in the world to survive half a year with virtually all new insides And she's not just surviving, but making her presence felt. The 3 -LCB- - year-old recipient of a record-setting five transplant organs ignores doctors and nurses after they do something she dislikes, shows her displeasure by pitching her Pampers to the floor, and yanks out her intravenous tubes when her mother steps out of sight She throws tantrums when she's not lifted out of bed as soon as she demands and resists being undressed by stiffening her arms. She's not keen about trying different kinds of blended food and, when she does, always spits out the peas. `` She's been spoiled since the day she came into the world. A lot of her bad habits are going to have to be broken,'' said <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. Still, Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> and doctors agree that trait is `` what's kept her, her spunk, her stubbornness.'' The 36-pound pigtailed toddler from <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, had most of her abdomen replaced in experimental surgery at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> In the 15-hour operation that ended Nov. 1, she received a new liver, small intestine and pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon. Similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the world, both times unsuccessfully. A multiple transplant has since been done at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> The 10-month-old patient, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is reported in good condition. He received a new liver, small intestine, pancreas and part of a stomach Feb. 9. Despite her feistiness, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s recovery has been far from smooth. She's been beset during the past six months by a series of liver problems, a threatening virus and a mysterious three-hour lapse of consciousness. Her latest setback, a buildup of bile in her liver, prompted doctors in mid-April to insert a drainage tube and downgrade her condition from fair to serious. `` As many small things go wrong, you have to be worried. But I think on the whole, these two cases certainly indicate the feasibility of the whole thing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON>, director of transplant surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and affiliated Presbyterian-University Hospital. `` They're cutting-edge cases, and I'm sure there will be more.'' Three days after <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> was born, doctors removed 95 percent of her small bowel because of a potentially fatal intestinal deformity. She was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet, which damaged her liver. Doctors at <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> determined it would be easier to replace the entire five-organ group than just <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s liver and small intestine. The hospital's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> granted permission Oct. 23 for the risky surgery on humanitarian grounds. `` There was no protocol established for this type of procedure,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. `` The statistics worldwide for people who had undergone similar operations were not very encouraging.'' The Fosters needed only a day to make up their minds. `` We really did n't have much of a choice,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 29. `` I had seen the downfalls -LRB- at home -RRB- and she bounced back from them. She's been on death row so many times, and I just knew that we'd made it this far, there's no sense giving up.'' On Oct. 31, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> went into surgery to receive the organs of a 7-week-old <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> girl who had died in an auto accident. She emerged from the operating room the next day with glowing, healthy skin, previously yellowed by her malfunctioning liver. `` She had n't been like that for years,'' said her father, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 36, who has two children from a previous marriage. Now, too, she can consume solid food _ baby cereal, vegetables and fruits and yogurt _ in addition to the liquid diet she receives intravenously and through a stomach tube. Confined to a hospital all but seven weeks of her life, <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> rather likes the attention there, according to her parents. Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> spends virtually every minute with <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>, often sleeping in a pull-out vinyl chair in the child's private room. Her husband comes up as much as his job allows. `` I think she enjoys being at the nurses' station more than she does being in the playroom,'' <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. The feeling is mutual. `` Of any kid I've met in or out of this hospital, I think she's an exceptional child She's so pleasant, so lovable,'' said <PERSON> Roz </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, 23, a registered nurse who regularly surprises <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> with presents. `` I want her to go home. But someone said today, ` What are you going to do when she leaves?''' Nurses are n't the only ones who have been touched by <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s tale. The Fosters, quiet-spoken factory workers, have been overwhelmed by gifts sent to their daughter _ enough toys to fill 19 big boxes, two boxes' worth of cards, including notes and drawings from schoolchildren. Two teddy bears were so huge they had to be sent home by bus. `` It's a shock to me. I just thought we'd get the transplant and that would be it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. `` It's a funny thing. Everybody knows you and you do n't know them.'' What's even more astounding to the couple is the $ 355,000 in donations they have received to help cover <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s medical expenses. Contributors include President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and the rock group <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, Wind and Fire. About 40 percent of the money has come from black churches throughout the country, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> attorney who is serving as trustee of the Tabatha Foster Fund. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> is black. `` We feel that it's the job of the human race to get behind <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> and to support her in her endeavor,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s fund-raising drive for <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> estimates more than $ 350,000 still is owed the hospital and bills keep mounting, but officials have indicated the hospital likely will absorb any unpaid costs since the operation was experimental and therefore uninsurable. The Fosters do n't expect <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> to be discharged as an outpatient much before her fourth birthday on June 10. They realize their worries about infection and organ rejection wo n't vanish once they're all back home. `` It's a touch-and-go situation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said, `` and it's going to be that way for the rest of <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s life.

<TEXT>
 One not-yet-published book about the <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> forgery murders has been sold to television and another to film, but that does n't bother authors <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. They believe their own volume, `` Salamander: The Story of the Mormon Forgery Murders,'' is the one that will be read by the Mormon community which <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> betrayed. `` The Mormon Murders: A True Story of Greed, Forgery, Deceit and Death,'' by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Naifeh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and published by <PERSON> Weidenfeld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicolson </PERSON>, is scheduled for August release. It has been sold to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> as a possible miniseries. `` A Gathering of Saints: A True Story of Money, Murder and Deceit,'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, has a September publishing date. Film rights were purchased by 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a writer and architect, was a friend of <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s first victim, a fellow history buff. <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON> was a newspaper reporter who used <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> as a source early in the <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> story. Their collaboration began as an effort to explain <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> to the Mormons. Two years and 556 pages later, Signature Books of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is seeking to beat two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publishers out of a share of the national market. `` I think both of us were motivated by a need to know and to communicate with our own subculture,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, but they decided later to write for non-Mormon readers as well. For six years that unstructured Mormon subculture of about 3,000 scholars, writers, artists and historians had been dazzled and intrigued by <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s finds of supposedly historical documents that forced a sometimes painful re-examination of Mormon origins. The enigmatic <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s success gave him ready access to the high church officials numbered among his most avid customers. He had begun to forge lucrative American historical and literary documents when, under pressure to produce promised documents that did n't exist, he turned to murder to cover his tracks. His first bomb on Oct. 15, 1985, killed a young Mormon bishop, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, who had bought and donated <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>'s most famous creation, the so-called `` Salamander Letter,'' to the church. The `` Salamander Letter'' was purported to have been written by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an early associate of church founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. It gives an account of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s finding of gold plates _ from which he said he translated the `` Book of Mormon'' _ which is contrary to the official church version. The letter said an `` old spirit'' directed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to the plates, then transformed itself into a white salamander. The official church version has it that an angel named <LOCATION> Moroni </LOCATION> directed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to the plates in 1827. A second bomb, intended to divert suspicion from <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, killed <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, wife of a former <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> business partner. But a third bomb the next day _ which <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> called a suicide device _ seriously injured its maker and exposed him as the likely killer. Fifteen months later, in a controversial pre-trial plea bargain, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> admitted his guilt, detailed his forgeries and was sentenced to five years to life in prison. `` <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> was such an equal opportunity rip-off artist ... because he took everybody for what they were worth,'' said <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON>, who quit her job at the <ORGANIZATION> Deseret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in order to work on the book. `` It's not just that he exploited the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- secrecy or the paranoia that people criticize, but he also exploited the faith, and the values and the trust and the belief. Whatever people had to give, he exploited,'' she said. But `` Salamander'' is not merely an indictment of a master manipulator and forger. The authors sought in their interviews with some 200 sources to explain who and what had shaped a man for whom deceit was the means and the end. `` I think he had a double difficulty,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` His parentage was first-generation German and very authoritarian. And then you add to that the fact they were orthodox, conservative Mormons, which carres another layer of authoritarianism.'' An inquisitive boy, <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> could n't raise questions in that environment, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Thus, he was a secret agnostic while serving a mission for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> of Latter-day Saints and, more than a decade later, fooled a lie detector about the bombings. `` He comes right out of the heart of the culture in every way,'' <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON> said. `` And that's what was so fascinating to me about the story is that everything fed into it _ the history, the theology, the polygamy, everything. And you've got it right there on the doorstep of the Church Office Building.'' The authors sought to interview <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON>, 33, at <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>, where the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> recently told him he will spend the rest of his life. But the inmate refused. <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> were somewhat more successful with three church leaders who figured in the <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> story. They provided written answers to a dozen typed questions. Their reticence was understandable; <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> had cast them, as he had friends and family, in the role of dupe. `` I think there was a strong instinct to protect the institution,'' said <PERSON> Sillitoe </PERSON>, who regrets that the <PERSON> Hofmann </PERSON> case seems to have invigorated the faith's `` traditional, anti-intellectual segment.'' For Signature Books, `` Salamander'' is unique. The company, founded in 1981 to publish Mormon-related works, produced just six titles in 1987 and never has spent more than $ 15,000 to promote any one book. The Roberts-Sillitoe work has up to $ 100,000 in advertising. A publicist has been hired, the authors are touring and there is a first printing of 15,000 copies, more than double Signature's previous high

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON>, no longer the tight-lipped <PERSON> Furillo </PERSON> of `` Hill Street Blues,'' is entering a new phase in his campaign to breach `` that mythical, mystical, invisible barrier'' that separates television from movie actors. <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON> can be seen in theaters this month in `` Midnight Crossing,'' a mystery thriller from <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. He plays the husband of <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>, who is blinded with glaucoma, and both embark on a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> yacht cruise that becomes enmeshed in stolen treasure and murder. <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON> discussed his life after `` Hill Street Blues'' at his <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION> home where his neighbors are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>. The series has obviously provided <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON> with prosperity. But it also left him with a new challenge. `` The problem for many actors,'' he said, `` is that mystical, mythical barrier that you have to cross through a misty field. You're on this side of it and you're called ` a television actor.' Or you're called ` a theater actor.' On the other side is the cinema _ motion pictures, feature films. `` Somehow they see you coming and they do n't want you to cross over. I do n't know why. Nobody has been able to explain it. They used to say: ` People do n't want to pay to see someone when they can see him free.' That's all changed. `` And so you face that strange phenomenon of crossing over that foggy field and coming out the other side and becoming a ` movie actor.' It has nothing to do with ability necessarily, or how you look or how you sound. Some make it, and some do n't. `` Since I finished the series last year, I've done what I wished I could do. I went from ` Midnight Crossing' to a play, ` I Never Sang for My Father,' which had a successful six-month tour. And now I'm doing another movie with <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, ` Millennium.' So by summer I will have done two feature films and a successful play tour. And my next television appearance will be an American Playhouse version of the play in June.'' The actor does n't worry about escaping the persona of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Furillo </PERSON>. `` I did that in the first season of ` Hill Street Blues,''' he said, `` by playing totally different characters in television movies, ` Adam' and ` A Case of Libel.' And I also played <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON> on television. `` Not all of the characters have been straight-arrow like the captain. The guy I played in ` A Matter of Libel' was ... complex. ... The guy in ` Midnight Crossing' is maybe a less-controlled cousin of that fellow, so to speak. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON>, one of the heroes of our time, was also a complicated man, though we could n't show much of that in a two-hour movie.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Travanti </PERSON> is a late bloomer as an actor. `` I charged through college -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in three years with <LOCATION> Phi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kappa </LOCATION> and every other honor. I knocked my brains out. I do n't know what ... I was rushing toward. No matter how fast I ran, it turned out I could n't get there any faster than I was supposed to. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it all screeched to a crawl,'' he said. `` Many actors, who are told they are talented in school or regional theaters, get to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and get stonewalled _ not frozen out; I worked all the time. I was just so confused and so neurotic that I drove myself crazy. And I drove others around me crazy. `` For a long time I limped along and bumped along and hiccupped along. I always made a living _ this fall will mark 25 years as an actor, never having to work as anything else. The big turning point came 15 years ago when I found sobriety,'' he said, referring to his alcoholism. `` I do n't want to belabor that, because I do n't want it to be an overpowering identity of mine. But I am willing to mention it and talk about it privately. `` Since then it's been a matter of patiently trudging, chugging, moving steadily along and hoping for a break.''

 Yugoslavs are at a crossroads, and the way they turn could mean profound changes in the route <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> mapped out for them when he founded the communist state after World War II. The road <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> takes is likely to depend on the outcome of a fierce public struggle between <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hardliners and reformers demanding changes, including market-oriented economic policies, pluralistic politics and greater links with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But right now, political disarray is paralyzing decision-making at a time of deep economic crisis, the worst ever in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s postwar history The nation is grappling with an inflation rate of 170 percent, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest, and a $ 20 billion foreign debt. Living standards for a people once well off by East European standards have declined by a third since 1980 and about 1.1 million people, about 15 percent of the work force, are looking for jobs. The outcome of the clash between hardliners and reformers could have deep meaning not only for 23.2 million Yugoslavs but also for other East European nations, some of which face similar, but less pressing, decisions in the era of reform laid down by General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is officially a non-aligned nation that functions independently of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and has closer links to the West than the Soviet allies. Hardliners here are contending that reformers' demands would mean a restoration of capitalism in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, although the reformers say they remain socialists. <PERSON> Dobrica </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON>, a reformer and former prominent communist who is now <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s best-selling author, has described the country as `` a gravely ill <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> patient with an uncertain future.'' `` The fate of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will be decided in a struggle between repressive and conservative authorities ... who will use all available means to defend the existing regime'' and forces `` that strive for an enlightened, civilized, pluralistic socialism _ for a modern society and democratic <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>,'' he was quoted by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> as telling a group of Serbian writers. <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON> did not specify what he meant by `` all available means,'' but many <PERSON> Yugoslavs </PERSON> took him to mean the use of police or even military repression to keep public criticism and dissent from spreading. <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON>, a World War II partisan who was purged from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s, spoke at a Serbian writers meeting during which proposals were made for amending the constitution adopted in 1974 while <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> was alive and the nation's sole leader The constitution granted wide autonomy to the country's six, often fractious republics and two provinces. The document is generally blamed for the today's problems. It created a virtual confederation in which each constituent region has power to veto important decisions. The result is endless arguments and deadlocks on key issues. Even the nation's presidency is rotated among the regions. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON> maintained that the existing system is `` only a semblance of a socialist society _ in reality it is a state of organized chaos, which has antagonized our peoples and republics ... and which has caused our economy to slide into total unprofitability.'' A joint statement by unions of Serbian writers, philosophers and sociologists, adopted at the meeting, called for an end to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, a one-party state like other East European countries. Recently, a number of leading intellectuals in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic, and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the most economically developed region, called on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to permit some degree of political pluralism as one way of overcoming economic and political problems. It was the first time that official groups had issued any written statement of that kind. The state-run press and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials assailed the intellectuals' statement and <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON>'s speech, charging that they represent an attempt to subvert the government. The authorities reacted even more sharply to criticism in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s media of the army and the state security service. A number of articles published in the Slovenian press, particularly in the liberal youth periodical <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, had denounced the army as an undemocratic, pro-Soviet institution prepared to stage a military coup. Defense Minister <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamula </PERSON> and several high-ranking military officials had previously voiced concern about what they saw as a deterioration in the economic and political situations. The communist leadership responded to the attacks on the army and security forces with sharp warnings against such criticism and called for legal action against it. The official reaction culminated in early April when a parliamentary commission responsible for state security denounced the critical articles as part of an international conspiracy to overthrow the government. <PERSON> Jelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovric </PERSON>, a prominent political columnist for <LOCATION> Danas </LOCATION>, widely considered the most liberal state-run periodical, rejected that official claim. She said the real danger for the government stemmed from the domestically triggered economic crisis and that the claim of foreign-backed conspiracies `` is creating chaos and sowing fear among the already frightened populace.'' `` Are such panicky assertions about anti-socialist conspiracies not in fact aimed at creating the conditions for use of all available measures?'' she wrote in a commentary, apparently alluding to <PERSON> Cosic </PERSON>'s remarks. At a recent meeting <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON>, leader of the more liberal <ORGANIZATION> Slovenian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, contended that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s `` unvanquished crisis'' is jeopardizing the country's communist system `` Changes, radical ones, are more than necessary,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Kucan </PERSON> as saying. Communists in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> have been the most outspoken in offering unorthodox proposals for the country's problems, including a more market-oriented economy and closer ties with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In April, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> began a procedure to force Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON>'s federal government out of office on grounds that its economic policies were ineffective. The action was the first of its kind in postwar <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. Communist Party officials in other Yugoslav republics maintained that the Slovenian legislative action would mean a return of capitalism. Responing in an interview to that contention, <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s president-elect, <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON>, said: `` Those who follow events in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> from the outside see enemies and counterrevolutionaries everywhere, while we here are feeling ... the enthusiasm of a democratic reform.

<TEXT>
 When two bankers were gunned down in a 1983 ambush on an abandoned southwest <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farm, some speculated that bitterness about the farm crisis was behind the violence. But a new book contends that a conspiracy between a failed dairy farmer whose marriage had crumbled and his militaristic teen-age son _ not the rural economic crisis _ triggered the killings. `` I look at the killings as being the final outcome of a broken family and broken identities,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, 49, the book's author and a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> `` When Father and Son Conspire: A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Farm Murder'' concentrates on the relationship between <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and his 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, and discounts the farm crisis of the 1980s as a major factor in the murders. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said in an interview that he became intrigued by the case because `` it just seemed to be very peculiar that a father and son would get together and ambush a man.'' His journalistic account of the killings took 2 -LCB- years to research and write. Published in March by <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the 226-page book is now in a second printing of 3,000 copies after selling out a first run of 2,500, according to <PERSON> Neelum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhry </PERSON>, the publisher's advertising and publicity manager As former director of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s rural studies program, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said he was familiar with the problems facing farmers. He also knew the terror that swept the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> prairie the night of the killings. `` Doors that had n't been locked in memory were locked. People who really did n't like neighbors slept over at their house that night,'' he said. On the morning of Sept. 29, 1983, <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Deems `` Toby'' Thulin were shot to death on a 10-acre abandoned dairy farm near the small town of <LOCATION> Ruthton </LOCATION> in the southwest corner of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> was president of <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ruthton </LOCATION>, which had taken over the farm abandoned by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> in 1980. <PERSON> Thulin </PERSON> was <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>'s chief loan officer. The two were lured to the deserted farm by a telephone caller who said he was interested in the property. Two men were seen fleeing the farm in a white pickup truck, and a search began for <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> and his son. Three days later, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> surrendered to authorities in <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He led authorities to an abandoned farm where his 46-year-old father was found dead of a shotgun blast. The death was ruled a suicide by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> portrays the two men as frustrated by lost dreams, working each other into a rage. The elder <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' marriage had recently collapsed and he had declared bankruptcy. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> speculates that the younger <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, a high school dropout, was upset that a spleen injury suffered in an accident might end his dream of joining the military. `` This father worked this son up and this son either used his father or exploited his father,'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said. He maintains that tension between the two men was the cause of the killings. `` I think this father brought out the aggression in the son.'' For the two, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said, the crime may have been the `` last lie they shared together. And the lie was, ` I'll have a farm and you'll be a soldier.' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> argues that the farm crisis played a minor role. He notes that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> failed as a farmer in 1980, several years before the farm crisis reached its peak. Though a hard worker and clever handyman, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said, the elder <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> failed `` when just about anyone would have made it farming.'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>'s theories differ markedly from those of a previous book on the killings. `` Final Harvest: An American Tragedy,'' published in 1986, links the killings to the farm crisis. That book's author, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>'s book. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Schewe </PERSON>, issued a statement about the book: `` Mr. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> did a fairly credible job of gathering the facts available, along with opinions and misinformation and weaving them into ` a story' to support his Greek tragedy. `` In the ` conspiracy' chapter he tells us in detail and depth of <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON>' innermost thoughts and feelings. How can an accurate description of either be possible when he's never met nor spoken to the father or the son? We strongly disagree with the portrayal of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> is innocent.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> himself declined to be interviewed about the book. <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> speculates that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> lured the banker to the farm to either kidnap or terrorize him. The bank president and his loan officer apparently surprised the father and son by arriving earlier than expected. According to the prosecution's scenario at <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' 1984 trial, the teen-ager fired his M-1 carbine at <LOCATION> Thulin </LOCATION>, killing the loan officer, then chased <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON> across the yard and cut him down with a second volley. The prosecution argued that <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, who liked Marine-type haircuts, camouflage fatigues and tattoos, was the triggerman. The younger <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> was obsessed with guns, explosives and the military, and slept with the murder weapon in his room. His father was unfamiliar with guns, had poor eyesight and was n't fit enough to have chased <PERSON> Blythe </PERSON>, the prosecution contended. A <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury agreed that <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> pulled the trigger. He was convicted of first - and second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison He becomes eligible for parole in 2001, when he will be 36.

 With just a touch-up here and there, `` Necessity'' could be a fine satire on the made-for-TV movie genre. `` Necessity'' stars <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> as a model named <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSalle </PERSON> who is living an idyllic life with husband and darling baby girl when, suddenly, after several years of marriage, she realizes that her husband is a cocaine dealer. Apparently she has never asked why he has a helicopter and several hit men hanging around their fabulous upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> house. While this woman is clearly no mental giant, she does figure out how to swipe $ 2 million of hubby's drug money, establish a new identity in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and launder the funds through stock market transactions. But `` Necessity'' does intend to be taken seriously. Just to double check, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> calls it a `` drama of shattered illusions.'' Luckily for those involved, the movie airs Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' black hole of ratings, so no one, neither friends nor colleagues nor relatives, nor anyone else for that matter, need ever know Back to <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, who, once ensconced in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, takes flying lessons. Is she going to forget the kid and start a new life as a commercial airline pilot? No way! She's going to go back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and swoop down and pluck her child from the evil influences of her husband, who is busy obsessing in artful double exposures about the wrong she has done him. Which brings us to the subject of bizarre casting. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, who plays the `` dese-and-dose'' drug dealing husband, most recently starred in <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s film of `` The Glass Menagerie.'' No flies on him. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, the lovable flying instructor, can currently be seen in <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s film `` The Milagro Beanfield War.'' Both are fine stage actors. Are their agents telling them they better grab this turkey while they can, since they might never work again? A really dumb made-for-TV movie starring <PERSON> Loni </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>? Sure, sign us up! Well, maybe at least they thought it was a satire. Anyway, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> must tell <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, who is quite good at high-speed car chases, that she's nevertheless just too darn dumb to operate an airplane. Since <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> has a kid of his own, and can use $ 50,000, he agrees to pilot the baby-napping plane himself. The getaway goes awry, of course, so <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> slaps baby in a car seat and takes off on a high-speed truck-helicopter chase through the hills and vales. <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> apparently believes it is better to risk Baby's neck stunt-driving over brushy cliffs and mowing down fences than leave her to grow up on daddy's drug money. All this set-up is just so wonderfully kitsch, it's hard to believe the ending is even better. In fact, it's so good, it's worth taping, just for the slow-mo dialogue and 12 gunshots pumped into a victim who stands up and grabs his shoulder This is serious, is n't it?

 Ancient custom permits one woman in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to take another as a `` wife,'' but a divorce case involving two such women has thrown up a challenge to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s Western-style legal system. The case involves <PERSON> Wanjiru </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, a barren widow, who 10 years ago took <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Njeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> as a `` wife'' to bear her the children she desperately wanted. The relationship went sour and the women have asked a Western-style divorce court to sort out their broken marriage, including the question of alimony, child support and property settlement. `` We do n't have a precedent for this case,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mberi </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` The problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in the courts is changing to the Western legal system. But at the same time, in the village we are living with people whose arrangements are based on customary law concepts.'' Marriage between women is not uncommon in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and neither is divorce. But this case is unique because the couple has turned to Western laws, instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders decide the issue. Barren women, such as Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, often take one or more fertile women as `` wives'' to bear children, which the female `` husband'' then claims as her own. Even married women make such arrangements, with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his spouse's wife. Barren women often are ostracized in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where wealth and prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has. Since both Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> were single, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> was entitled to choose the man to father the children. For the surrogate mother, such an arrangement offers the security of a home and income. Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON>, in her late 20s, was a single mother of two children, aged 12 and 10, when she married Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> and took her surname. She brought them to Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s home and had two more children, now 7 and 5. After a fierce quarrel in January 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> chased her `` wife'' from their matrimonial home in the western Kenyan town of <LOCATION> Nakuru </LOCATION>, according to court records. Before turning to the Western-style courts, Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> twice went to a court of tribal elders, asking for alimony and child support or a share of Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s property, including a small grocery store. Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>, about 60, complained that Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> beat her, threatened her life and stole from the business. Both times the elders ruled that Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> could keep the children but should receive nothing else. `` This was not a hardship in the past, as the woman would go back to her father and his community, which jointly owned and shared land and resources,'' explained <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamau </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> lawyer who specializes in family law. Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> did return to her father, a peasant farmer near <LOCATION> Nakuru </LOCATION>. But when she felt that she and the children were a burden, she sued her former `` husband'' for divorce in the district magistrate's court, again demanding alimony and child support or a share of Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s property. She filed suit in August 1986, but the case has been delayed by a backlog and is expected to be heard soon. Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON> had told the tribal courts Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> had no money or property when they married, and that the relationsip gave her status and a comfortable lifestyle. <PERSON> Odhiambo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochieng </PERSON>', Ms. <PERSON> Gutu </PERSON>'s lawyer, argues in an affidavit that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law, only a traditional solution is possible: for Ms. <PERSON> Macharia </PERSON> to return to her father's family with nothing. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s very diversity is at the root of the now-budding legal problems. The East African nation's 22 million people are divided among dozens of ethnic groups who abide by Islamic, <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> and various tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory Western laws inherited from British colonizers at independence 25 years ago. A case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer, S.M. <PERSON> Otieno </PERSON>, against his <PERSON> Luo </PERSON> clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow or the tribe should bury him. The High Court ruled that in the absence of written law, customary law prevails. <PERSON> Otieno </PERSON>'s widow lost. `` These problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go away until <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> is lived in by an overall younger and more modern generation,'' <PERSON> Ochieng </PERSON>' said.

 A 199-year-old proposed constitutional amendment that would delay pay raises that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> give themselves until voters have a say is being spurred toward <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a college student who says he's tired of the `` sneaky'' way the pay hikes now come about. The amendment has been approved by 23 state legislatures. Asked what will happen if the required three-fourths majority of states ratify it, a congressional researcher replied, `` I do n't know.'' `` It's a sleeper,'' said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> legislator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, who this year added his state to the roll call of those ratifying the amendment. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> also approved it in 1988. The amendment, first proposed in 1789 by the framers of the Constitution as part of a 12-amendment Bill of Rights, states: `` No law varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'' By 1791, six states had ratified it: <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The bandwagon stalled until 1873, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> bestowed on itself a whopping raise and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> ratified the amendment. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> approved it 1978. Then, in 1982, along came <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student who was researching a term paper on the death of the Equal Rights Amendment when he was sidetracked `` by this little book that said five or six amendments never had been ratified.'' In the dustbin with the congressional pay proposal were amendments allowing slavery, prohibiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens from accepting titles of nobility and outlawing child labor. `` With the December 1981 fiasco still fresh in my mind _ when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave itself a special tax break which no other American would enjoy _ I thought, ` <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, why do n't you try to get this ratified?''' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> mailed letters to state legislators. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, then-state Sen. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shute </PERSON> wrote back. The next year, <PERSON> Shute </PERSON> introduced a resolution ratifying the 1789 amendment. `` Boom, it passed,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Excited by success in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> sent more letters and found more legislators willing to propose resolutions backing the amendment. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> joined in 1984, followed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in 1985. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> ratified in 1986, and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in 1987 _ when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> gave itself two pay raises. Ratification resolutions have been introduced in every state but <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` I think the average American feels the way I do,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` You should n't begrudge a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from getting a fair wage. What I object to is the sneaky, tricky, cutesy way they hide these raises.'' He referred to last year's maneuvering, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> made token votes refusing $ 12,100 pay raises and then pocketed the money. Consumer advocates attacked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, for delaying the vote until its results no longer mattered. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had already given itself a 3 percent increase last year, to compensate for inflation. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now make $ 89,500. `` I think people are disgusted with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON>, who helped ratify the amendment in his state this year. `` <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> has made an obsession out of rectifying the situation.'' Not everyone feels so strongly. Even <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, who made the pay stricture part of his proposed <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> of Rights, argued for it somewhat half-heartedly _ possibly a reason why it is n't among the 10 amendments that became the Bill of Rights. `` I do not believe this is a power which in the ordinary course of government will be abused,'' <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> said, `` ... but there is a seeming impropriety in leaving any set of men without control to put their hands in the public coffers.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> legislator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON>, calling the resolution `` frivolous,'' tried to kill it in committee. `` It's as moldy as 6-month-old bread!'' he contended. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has refused to let the resolution out of his <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We consider tinkering with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution pretty serious stuff. I'm not going to do it based on the word of some guy from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who called the amendment a `` non-issue.'' Opposition to the amendment is fueled by self-interest, said <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Coverdell </PERSON>. Before this year's success, his attempts to achieve ratification were blocked in committee for three years. `` I guess the committee members all hoped to be in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Nonetheless, he said, `` It's like apple pie and motherhood. Nobody was willing to oppose it. But I can tell you I got no support.'' What happens if <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s amendment wins ratification in the required 38 states and gets to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? `` I do n't know,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckabee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> analyst. But the amendment, which has no deadline, is bound to be a sore spot, he said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chooses to not accept the ratification because it's so old, there's a question of whether you could get enough legal footing to get it into court. It's possible that the courts might not want to enter into the fray,'' <PERSON> Huckabee </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, backs the issue, `` but I have some question as to whether the courts would uphold such an old amendment since some of the ratifications are so ancient If need be, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, he will re-introduce the measure to ensure courts uphold it. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif., is trying to do just that in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but his amendment remains in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> `` I think it's basically self-interest,'' <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> said of the opposition. `` It's amazing how little support there is for this, but nobody -LRB- publicly -RRB- opposes it.'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Mich., who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee endorsing the last raise and who was quoted as saying the raise was `` too damn little,'' remains silent on the amendment `` I'm not certain if he cares to say anything on this,'' said his aide, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, now 25, said he received a `` C'' on his term paper from a professor who did n't think the amendment was much of an issue, <PERSON> Huckabee </PERSON> saw a broader meaning in the student's efforts. `` This is quite a civics lesson,'' he said, `` that one person can make a difference.''

<HEAD>The Pulitzer Collection of Modern Art on Exhibit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was an undergraduate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1935, he bought a striking painting by <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>, beginning an extraordinary collection of modern art. The collection grew to more than 250 paintings, drawings and sculptures in the ensuing half-century. Pulitzer recently returned to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> for the opening of an exhibit featuring 86 of his those works. More than 40 artists are represented in the exhibit, which will be at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> until June 12 when it moves to the <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> from July 8 through Aug. 28. `` There are perhaps only three or four museums in the country who could put together, from their own collections, a display to match the depth and breadth of this one,'' said <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowron </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION>. Included are 12 works by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, four each by <PERSON> Monet </PERSON>, <PERSON> Klee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>; three each by <PERSON> Degas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Matisse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lipchitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>; and pieces by <PERSON> Cezanne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brancusi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>. `` I wanted to buy creative art that would have a validity and vitality that would transcend fashion,'' said <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON>, whose grandfather's will established the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism and the arts. `` I was much more interested in the living rather than going deeply into the past,'' he said, explaining why he chose to collect modern art. A fine arts major at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> graduated in 1936 and joined the staff of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION>. He became its editor and publisher and now is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pulitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He has been generous with his purchases, giving pieces to museums, including the <PERSON> Fogg </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which has that first <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON>, `` Elvira Resting at a Table.'' Some remain at his home. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> started -LRB- collecting -RRB- from the purest of reasons _ love of art,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, chief curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>. `` And, he's not cashing in his chips,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> added, referring to collectors who sell for profit. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bowron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss-Levy </PERSON>, curator of prints, drawings and photographs at the <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>, made the selections from the Pulitzer collection to put in the exhibit. `` It was intended to demonstrate the quality and range of the collection,'' <PERSON> Bowron </PERSON> said of their choices, and noted that <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> also had a say. `` We made the initial selection, but then <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, with his unerring eye, said, ` You must put in this one and that one,''' <PERSON> Bowron </PERSON> said. Installing the exhibit was difficult because the works were so varied in size, media and style. One perspective on the exhibit, said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, is that <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> bought the <PERSON> Modigliani </PERSON> four years before <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON>, who has a painting, a drawing and a sculpture in the show, was born. `` The collection is very much a synopsis of mainstream modernism and its evolving,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` In a certain sense we distilled them -LRB- the selections -RRB- out of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s distillation, a summary history of modern art in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It is a history of modern art.'' The exhibit also marks the publication by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION> of the fourth volume of the catalog of the Pulitzer collection. It was written by <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON> <PERSON> Zander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudenstine </PERSON>, a curator and scholar and, as a member of the visiting committee, an adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s fine arts department. `` I have said ... to <PERSON> Angelica </PERSON>, if she ever departs from, her profession as art historian, I would like to hire her for the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION> as an investigative reporter,'' <PERSON> Pulitzer </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If current corporate earnings were the only determinant of trends in stock prices, the market would surely be thriving right now. Companies in a wide variety of industries, big names and small, have lately posted strong profit gains for the first quarter. And most analysts agree that the earning outlook remains bright for the balance of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> calculates that the several hundred companies included in its industrial index chalked up a 39 percent increase in profits last year. For 1988, it estimates a further 21 percent gain. The earnings picture has been much stronger than would be suggested by the pace of overall economic growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been moderate at most. As <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> observed: `` Recent cost-cutting and streamlining have produced earnings increases that have oustripped the economy's sluggish pace. A weak dollar has helped industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> gain a better competitive position in world markets. Prominent companies like <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, to cite two examples from the past few days, have accompanied their latest reports with announcements of dividend increases. But while the earnings trend may be causing great cheer in executive suites around the country, it has met with a chilly reception on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where stock prices continue to drift around aimlessly on low volume. `` The market has n't yet rewarded positive surprises, but has punished disappointments,'' said <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. This is hardly the first time, of course, that the stock market has been seemingly out of synch with the producing and consuming economy. The question investors have to grapple with is not how earnings are doing now, but what they will look like six months, a year or more in the future. Just how far ahead the market, in its collective vision, can `` see'' is a matter of long-standing debate. It can be argued that many of the gains now being posted in corporate profits were `` discounted,'' or foreshadowed in stock prices, during the great bull market of 1982-87. In early 1987, notes <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's in its advisory publication The Outlook, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P industrial stocks traded at prices as much as 23 times their current earnings. Recently, the P-E ratio has been running at a much more conservative 12 to 1, depressed by the crash last fall and more recent worries about rising interest rates and inflation. Even if P-Es merely hold at their recent levels, a continued rise in earnings would theoretically translate into high stock prices. `` A 20 percent increase in 1988 earnings -LRB- of companies in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average -RRB- would be enough to support a Dow industrial average of 2,800,'' argues <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON> in his advisory letter <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>'s Journal. `` And there is at least the possibility that earnings gains this year will exceed 20 percent.'' More pessimistic observers contend earnings do n't carry much weight in times of high or rising interest rates. `` Even as the threat of recession recedes and strong corporate earnings are reported,'' say analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, they believe `` stock-price earnings multiples will be trending lower over the course of 1988.''

 <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malden </PERSON> says `` My Father, My Son'' is the story of a close-knit family rather than a story of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the tragedy of Agent Orange. <PERSON> Malden </PERSON> plays Adm. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who ordered the use of the chemical defoliant Agent Orange to cler the jungle away from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s rivers to protect <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> plays his son, <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a former patrol boat skipper, who believes his cancer was caused by the defoliant. `` I think what you're going to see is a terrific family love story,'' said <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>. `` I've never seen a family so tight.'' The two-hour film is based on the book the Zumwalts wrote about their experiences. The movie, which <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will televise Sunday, May 22, was shot in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` It's a fascinating story,'' said <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>. `` When the admiral was assigned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, his son wanted to go, too. And when the admiral gets there he realizes the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> are knocking off the boat crews left and right because the jungle goes right down to the river. It was giving them protection. `` The admiral heard they were using Agent Orange in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to kill weeds on some farms. He looked into it and then ordered its use. The irony is that his son was captain of one of those little river boats, and his son was the only one on his boat to get sick.'' <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was afflicted with two kinds of cancer, lymphoma and <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s Disease, which both Zumwalts believe was caused by Agent Orange. He has undergone chemotherapy, radiation and bone marrow transplants. `` The admiral did some investigating later and found the government had led him astray about Agent Orange,'' said <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>. `` The government knew there was a higher rate of cancer in those areas where it was used as a defoliant and withheld the information.'' In addition, the younger <PERSON> Zumwalt </PERSON> has a son with a learning disability. `` Elmo and his wife came with their two children when we were shooting the boat scenes,'' said <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>. `` They built a little village in the swamp. The boy was so excited. I was in uniform and wearing the admiral's name badge. <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON> told his son, who's about 10 or 12, ` This is grandpa.' `` All that day I was grandpa to the boy and he kept kissing me. On the boat going back he sat next to me. His affection was so touching. I had to look the other way. I think the admiral feels he's the cause of <PERSON> Elmo </PERSON>'s and the boy's problem. I think he feels guilty.'' This was not <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>'s first military role. He played Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> in `` Patton.'' He was in `` Winged Victory,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> stage show in World War II that was also filmed as a movie. `` After the war, I was in every kind of war movie,'' he said. `` I was a private, a corporal and I was the good sergeant to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Widmark </PERSON>'s tough sergeant in ` Take the High Ground.''' <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>, who had made his movie debut before the war, won an Oscar as best supporting actor for `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Three years later, he teamed up with <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> again for `` On the Waterfront.'' Most recently, he co-starred in the Barbra Streisand movie `` Nuts.'' <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>, well-known to television audiences for his 15 years as spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> travelers checks, played Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> in the TV series `` Streets of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.'' His co-star, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, just won an Academy Award as best actor for `` Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Malden </PERSON>'s only other series was `` Skag,'' in which he played a steel mill worker. That was a role he played in real life in his hometown of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, before he became an actor. `` My father was an amateur actor in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and after he came to this country he organized 30 church choirs,'' he said. `` He was president for six years of the Serbian Singing Society of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He was a milkman and did that when he had time off. `` I decided to become an actor because I was n't getting anywhere in the mills. I had friends at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and decided to go there. When I told my father he said, ` Are you crazy? You want to give up a good job in the middle of the Depression?' Thank God for my mother. She said to give it a try.''

<HEAD>Mineral Mining Limited To Brazilian Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a victory for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s left, lawmakers re-writing <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s authoritarian constitution have voted overwhelmingly to limit mineral mining to domestic companies. The Thursday night vote came on the heels of a Wednesday vote to give special protections to certain domestically-owned enterprises, a move that foreign businessmen indicated may discourage the influx of foreign capital to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s beleaguered economy. Legislators doubling as a constituent assembly sang the national anthem Thursday night after voting to prohibit foreign companies from mining for minerals or drilling for hydraulic energy. The constitutional article would give foreign companies such as subsidiaries of British Petroleum, bauxite mining companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Alcan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Anglo-American Company a five-year grace period to adapt to the new legislation. Foreign-owned companies control 20 percent of mining rights or requests for mining rights in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Private domestic companies own 52 percent and state-run companies own 18 percent. Also on Thursday, legislators voted 303-156 to maintain present legislation allowing foreign participation in petroleum distribution. A radical proposal that was rejected would have barred <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> from selling gasoline in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Foreign companies now hold 55 percent of the market here. The Thursday votes followed Wednesday's equally radical decisions making it harder and less inviting for foreign companies to operate in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. In a bipartisan agreement, law-makers voted to define what constitutes a `` Brazilian company'' and a `` domestic-capital Brazilian company.'' The key distinction is that domestic-capital companies will enjoy as yet-undetermined `` protection and special benefits'' and will be allowed to develop the also yet-undetermined `` strategic or essential'' areas of the economy. Legislators decided that a domestic-capital company must have a majority of its voting capital and its decision-making power belonging permanently to residents of this country. A Brazilian company would be simply any company established under Brazilian law. The congress is expected to finish <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s eighth constitution late this year. Rep. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavalcanti </PERSON>, of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the new laws prevent multinationals from being considered national, that is Brazilian, concerns. `` It's not fair that, say, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> has the right and the access to Brazilian savings,'' she said. `` This way, they can come in but with their own investments and own foreign savings.'' But the new statutes were widely considered nationalistic, and the initial reaction of foreign businessmen was negative. `` The red flag is up for foreign capital,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` It is unfortunate because they made it more difficult to do business in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>, a businessman who has lived in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1962, said the law will be harmful to the Brazilian economy by limiting the vital influx of foreign capital. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is strapped with a huge foreign debt of $ 121 billion, inflation of over 16 percent monthly and one of the world's most unequal distributions of wealth. About two-thirds of the nation's 143 million people earn less than $ 40 a week `` Brazilians have the right to change their own laws, but if their true objective is to change the life of millions of Brazilians, you first have to have an economy that will generate wealth,'' said <PERSON> Lund </PERSON>. `` You ca n't do that by limiting foreign capital.'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauer </PERSON>, a West German-born naturalized Brazilian who is president of <ORGANIZATION> Autolatina </ORGANIZATION>, the local holding group for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, said `` discrimination will not resolve the economic problems of this country.''

 Share prices moved higher Friday when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s unexpectedly good trade figures for March briefly energized the market The Financial Times-Stock Excahnge 100-share index was up 1 point, or 0.06 percent at 1,805.4, at about noon -LRB- 1100 GMT -RRB-. The market jumped about 5 points immediately after the release of the trade data. Volume was a modest 273.3 million shares, with investors disinclined to take major positions ahead of a three-day holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Monday is a bank holiday. By the same time Thursday, volume was 276.8 million shares. Although the market moved upward following the government's release of its trade report, share prices fell back when little follow-through buying appeared `` The figures were good but we did n't see any substantive buying because it's in front of a long weekend,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Alexanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cruickshank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade balance narrowed unexpectedly sharply in March to a seasonally adjusted 854 million pounds, or $ 1.61 billion, from 1.32 billion pounds, or $ 2.48 billion, in February, the government said Private economists had predicted a merchandise trade deficit of 1.1 billion pounds, or $ 2.07 billion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was recalling nearly 26,000 1988-model cars to fix possible problems with a transmission cable that could cause false readings in the gear shift indicator. Included in the recall were about 17,500 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regals </ORGANIZATION> and about 8,400 Pontiac Grand Prix models, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday in a written statement. Both models have potential problems with the transmission cable that could cause the cars to be in a gear other than that displayed on the shift indicator, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. Some Regals also may have a faulty stoplamp switch, which could make the brake lights inoperative when the brake pedal is depressed, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition, the secondary hood latch of some of the cars may not engage properly, presenting the danger of the hood opening unexpectedly if the primary latch were to malfunction. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries due to the potential problems. Owners were being notified to take the cars to dealers, who will make repairs at no cost.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese officials have reported no progress after a third day of meetings to break a deadlock over lowering Japanese trade barriers against American beef and oranges. They agreed to meet again today, but no one on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was optimistic about the outcome, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, spokesman for the chief American negotiator, Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The differences between the two sides `` have not been narrowed,'' said <PERSON> Hidero </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON>, spokesman and economic affairs chief for Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s negotiator. The negotiations are going to take longer than anticipated, <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> told reporters Thursday. Adding to the gloom, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a gathering of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visitors, `` chances are not as bright as I'd like to see,'' that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will further open its market to beef and oranges. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> repeated warnings that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will try to have the Japanese import quotas declared illegal under the rules of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been requesting that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> end the quotas that the two countries agreed to in a four-year pact that expired at the end of March with the collapse of an earlier round of Sato-Yeutter negotiations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said ending the quotas was still the demand. They declined to comment on Japanese reports that a compromise was under discussion. The talks have been centering on `` the timing of liberalization'' of imports into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said Japanese Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Toshiyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Takano </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Maki </PERSON>, four specific topics are covered in the negotiations. They are: improvement of access to the Japanese market; future role of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, the semigovernment body that now handles 80 percent of beef imports; interim measures pending liberalization and measures to follow lifting of the quotas, he said.

<HEAD>North Carolina's Duke Power Agrees to Run California Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively agreed to operate the troubled <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, company officials said. The deal is dependent on approval by <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> voters to restart the troubled facility, idled since an emergency shutdown in December 1985, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` If the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> voters approve, we are confident that we can operate <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> in a safe and efficient manner,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in announcing the agreement Thursday at the company's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. `` Competition is increasing and the shackles of regulation seem to be loosening in some quarters,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> told shareholders. `` There is risk, but also great opportunity.'' Three of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s seven nuclear units have the same <ORGANIZATION> Babcock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wilcox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reactor design as the Rancho Seco plant. Details of the agreement in principle with the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> Municipal Utility District were not disclosed. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said operating <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, would enable the Charlotte-based utility to diversify and market its engineering and technical services _ and thus increase diversified earnings. A negotiating team headed by <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s president and chief operating officer, met for several hours Wednesday in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION>'s genera manager, and other <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss an operating arrangement, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> officials said. The plant currently is the object of two competing local initiatives on June 7 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one, offered by <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> and supported by <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, would authorize an 18-month test operating period. The other would close the plant permanently. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION>'s five directors, attended <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting and accused <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of interfering with <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION>'s internal affairs and `` meddling'' with the ballot measure. <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> for contributing $ 100,000 to the campaign to keep the plant running and pleaded with shareholders: `` Please let us make that decision ourselves.'' In a subsequent interview, <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON> said, `` I do n't have a problem with <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wanting to come out and run a plant efficiently. I do n't have a problem with <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> wanting to make some money in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. My problem is the integrity of the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> political process.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> abandoned its interest in owning the plant after it failed to find a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> partner. But <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday, said, `` We think we're doing what's in our interests and the interests of those consumers.'' `` The plant has n't run well,'' he conceded. `` But they have invested $ 1 billion in it. The incremental cost of running it, now that they've already got that investment, is very little and lower than any other source of electricity in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly and sharply in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 1.61 billion from $ $ 2.48 billion in February, the government said Friday. However, the deficit was much wider than the deficit a year ago, which came to $ 703 million. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s total trade deficit also narrowed sharply.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Trade talks ended in deadlock Friday between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and officials of the island toughened their stand on further liberalizing its import and export policies. `` We had hoped to launch a bilateral trade liberalization action plan,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Assistant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, said at the end of a four-day negotiation session. `` Unfortunately, we have fallen short of that ambitious goal,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> delegation refused to reduce tariffs on 60 agricultural products, or to lift import bans on peanuts, poultry and animal organs. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to renew a five-year bilateral agreement next year that limits <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s rice exports was also rejected. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> called for scrapping a 1986 agreement that allows local magazines to advertize <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cigarettes, claiming it promotes smoking and also causes hardship for local tobacco growers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials rejected the request. `` We would not consider reducing tariffs on agricultural products because we did not protect our farmers more than your country did,'' said Vice Economic Minister <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien-shien </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> delegation. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials, however, promised to review later a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help reduce <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s massive trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which totaled $ 16 billion last year. Hundreds of farmers protested in the capital <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> earlier in the week, exhorting the government to resist any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands. The farmers claimed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s earlier tariff cuts on fruits and other agricultural products have already hurt their livelihoods. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February, including 480 agricultural items. Import duties dropped to an average rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent. In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to take measures to curb what the Americans called the rampant infringement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intellectual property rights, but differed with their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts on major details. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials agreed in principle that translations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> works require the permission of their authors, but opposed making the agreement retroactive. `` The discussion of a bilateral copyright agreement was very disappointing,'' <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s positions are out-of-step with more positive trends elsewhere in the region.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies lose `` tens of millions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars'' every year because of pirated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> works in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are still available at many book stores. That agreement does not extend to translations. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also agreed tentatively to give either patent or copyright protection to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor products. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, however, refused to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks to set up branches outside of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> or ease restrictions on their credit services. `` We know the modernization of our financial businesses can help with our economic development, but this has to be taken step by step,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. Officials said more negotiation sessions will be held in June and August to settle these differences.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds USG's Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can use a `` poison pill'' strategy in defending itself against <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 1.6 billion takeover bid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holderman </PERSON> refused Thursday to grant a preliminary injunction sought by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> against the use of the defensive tactic. USG's poison pill would make it prohibitively expensive for <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> to acquire an 85 percent stake in the company even if shareholders tendered the 39 million shares the Texas-based partnership is seeking. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would have the right to buy a new series of preferred stock if suitors, like <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, acquire more than 20 percent of USG stock. <PERSON> Holderman </PERSON> said he based his decision on the corporate laws of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where many major companies are incorporated. `` Once the board decides to maintain the company's independence, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> law does not require a board of directors to put their company on the auction block or assist a potential acquirer to formulate an adequate takeover bid,'' <PERSON> Holderman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Day said he was pleased with the decision. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, headed up by two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen, says it has lined up financing commitments totaling $ 1.9 billion, including a $ 1.4 billion bank facility and $ 500 million in subordinated debt. Desert Partners has offered $ 42 a share in cash for up to 39 million USG shares. In addition, they would offer about $ 600 million in debt securities and warrants, or rights to buy stock, also valued at $ 42 each, for the balance of the deal. Desert Partners now owns 9.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> shares.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s president is interested in either visiting <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or sending representatives to learn better ways of monitoring the cartel's oil production, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> says. In a telephone interview Thursday with The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he met for about 90 minutes with <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president and oil minister of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. `` We discussed the monitoring procedures we use at the commission to know what everyone is producing,'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` He expressed interest in coming to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or at least sending some of his staff to see how we do that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regulates oil production in the state, which was devastated economically by a collapse in world oil prices two years ago. Alleged quota cheating by some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> has been blamed for the current global oil glut and the weak prices. Members of the cartel have been meeting with non-member nations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to discuss ways to stabilize prices. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> did not participate in the meetings, but came to hold private talks with participants. His presence received widespread attention and incited speculation of a possible strategic relationship between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which would be the cartel's fourth-largest oil producer if it were a member Non-OPEC producers attending the meeting have suggested both <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC oil producers agree to 5 percent oil production cuts in order to boost prices. `` They've never really asked about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> making cuts,'' <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said. `` But I told them we could not, would not consider making cuts because we consume more than we produce.'' Earlier this week, <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he saw his mission as ` opening a dialogue'' with the cartel. `` We're not in love with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, but we need to have input'' into decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the world's oil supplies, he said. `` I look at what's happened to our <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy'' since oil prices crashed in 1986, he said. `` No one else is going to be speaking up for the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and someone had to do something.''

 Corning Glass Works, the nation's leading maker of cookware, said Friday it has signed a definitive agreement to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest manufacturer of range-top cookware. <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> said the acquisition would be made in cash, but spokesman <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> would not comment on a report that the price was $ 120 million. <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, Ill.-based maker of stainless steel and copper cookware, is a subsidiary of the privately held <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, founded by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> in 1801. `` The sale was very good for our company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Revere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ware </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said Friday from his <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> office. `` The two companies are very well alligned. There's little redundancy.'' About a quarter of <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s $ 2.1 billion in annual revenue comes from consumer products made of glass or glass-ceramics sold under the <ORGANIZATION> Pyrex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visions </ORGANIZATION> and Corelle trademarks, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> said. The acquisition, to be completed by the end of June, would add more than 10 percent to <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s consumer products sales. The company's consumer products division reported sales of $ 547.9 million in 1987. Corning Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said the acquisition `` offers us a strong brand name and a business that complements our own, affording us added value in the consumer marketplace.'' He said the deal will not dilute earnings in the first 12 months of operation and after that period, would be a contributor to earnings. `` We know that <PERSON> Revere </PERSON> will substantially strengthen <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>'s position in department stores, and that <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> can significantly broaden <PERSON> Revere </PERSON>'s position in other markets,'' <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> said In addition to consumer housewares, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> manufactures automobile pollution control devices, fiber optics and specialty glass and ceramics. It also operates a network of clinical testing labs. <PERSON> Corning </PERSON> recently was outbid by pharmaceutical giant <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to purchase <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Dull Days in the Marketplace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Compared to other periods over the past two decades, these are dull days in the marketplace. `` There are no new issues on the economic front,'' says a report from <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, supplier of economic numbers and projections to government and industry. About the only thing new, it says, is that the allegedy overextended recovery is simply one month older. Next month, it seems to suggest, the news is likely to be that the recovery is older by still another month. Everyone is watching for a rise or fall of interest rates, but the rates do n't respond. Inflation seems to be safely tucked away, for the moment at least. The dollar has stopped moving. The stock market seems tired of it all. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House are n't doing much to stir things, since it is well known that any brief period of calm can be destroyed by one ill-timed proposal or careless comment. Besides, it's an election year. Even the trade bill, once thought of as landmark legislation, is n't likely to make a very big difference in the economy. The consumer seems neither very bullish nor bearish. Investors hang around the sidelines. Quiet pervades. Every now and then there is an attempt to produce a little action. A report hints at inflation, but the next one buries the thought. Interest rates jiggle higher, but then fall back almost all the way. Concern develops that the expansion is turning into boom or bust, but the latest gross national product figures neutralize the fears, showing that growth is in the non-inflationary, non-recessionary range of 2.5 percent and steady. Such intervals have been rare in the past, and usually brief, and always have preceded movements one way or the other. This knowledge is a factor in the current quiet; it makes investors observers, waiting for cues to develop. Consider the contrast with the 1970s, when prices, interest rates and most other economic elements were out of whack. People knew then that prices and interest rates would continue to soar, so a wild enthusiasm was generated. Real estate hucksters appeared everywhere, selling desert land, swamp land and land that was n't even theirs to people who bought from a brochure and then went looking for it later. Get-rich-quick seminars roamed the country, with financial evangelists mesmerizing folks with tales of how they were down, out and broke a few years ago, but how they, just ordinary folks like you, learned to make a fortune. Believing them, ordinary folks went out and borrowed big amounts of money and invested it, mainly in real estate, certain that they could repay the bank with cheaper dollars while their assets soared in value. For many, it was true. Tax shelters were the rage; you might recall your neighbor bragging about how much in taxes he saved by getting into cattle feeding, and you knew that it did n't turn out the way he said it would when he never spoke about it again. It's very much different now. Nobody knows which way the economy is going to head. The big dreams have been tucked away for another day, and if there is any prevailing mood it is probably one of bearishness. Battered by the Oct. 19 crash, last year's outspoken stock market bulls morosely search for bearings. Small-investor conventions, once foot-stomping revivals for folks who dreamed of quick fortunes in coins, gold and odd stocks, are now like prayer meetings. Everyone waits for the economy to make a move one way or another, knowing that whenever it does there will be action again and plenty of those ingenious, creative, old-fashioned and often exploitive opportunities.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said today it has reached a tentative four-year contract agreement covering its 10,000 mechanics and ground service employees. The company also signed a contract today with the union representing 6,700 flight attendants. The union announced earlier today that its members had ratified the tentative agreement. The agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143 unifies three contracts covering former <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> workers and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> workers. The two Minneapolis-based airlines merged in 1986. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON>, the airline's vice president of law and labor relations, said the agreement was reached Thursday night after two weeks of negotiations. The agreement will bring former Republic workers to parity with their Northwest counterparts by increasing wages an average of 20 percent for ramp-service employees and 13 percent for mechanics and related personnel, <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president and general chairman of <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, announced the tentative agreement from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the same time <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> made the announcement at a news conference in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>. It was not immediately known whether the union was recommending approval or rejection of the contract. <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said the ratification process will begin next week and take a month or six weeks to complete. In addition to equalizing wages, the proposed agreement would include an average pay increase of about 3.2 percent a year for all employees covered by the contract. <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> said the agreement also unifies work rules, pensions and benefits, all modeled after the Northwest mechanics' contract. The proposed contract also includes a 5-year, new-hire pay scale with entry level wages 17 percent lower than current rates for unskilled and semi-skilled jobs. The tentative contract agreement with the flight attendants was reached on March 22, ending a strike threatened for March 29. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> Local 2747, said this morning that 61 percent, or 2,854 attendants, approved the contract, which 1,829 or 39 percent voted against. `` We're pleased that it was that strong a `` for'' vote considering the group of people who were trying to run a `` no'' vote campaign,'' Ms. <PERSON> Balzer </PERSON> said. A simple majority of the attendants voting was needed to ratify; 6,646 were eligible to vote. The Teamsters bargaining committee passed the contract proposal to union members without recommending approval or rejection. Union officials had said they expected it to be ratified. The pact would take effect June 1 and expire Dec. 31, 1992, but would not be retroactive to the contract starting date of Jan. 1, 1987. The pact merges two labor agreements to provide common wages, fringe benefits and work rules for all flight attendants. Under one section of the proposal, flight attendants who worked for the Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> before it merged with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 will receive pay raises averaging 18 percent, effective June 1. This will raise them to the highest wage rates of original Northwest attendants.

<HEAD>Thousands of Firms Fail To Get Full Approval Under New Securities
Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sweeping law to protect investors took effect Friday in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, but the new rules are so cumbersome that thousands of financial firms failed to get approval to stay in business and needed temporary reprieves. Widely criticized by the British securities industry, the government granted interim approval to about 7,000 firms until they could complete the complex paperwork and reporting requirements imposed by the law. About 30,000 other firms obtained approval prior to the deadline Friday, dubbed `` A Day,'' short for Appointed Day, the first day that key provisions of the Financial Services Act of 1986 were enforced. `` People are working very hard to get as many people through the hoop as quickly as possible,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dix </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for enforcing the new law. It was passed in response to the so-called `` Big Bang'' deregulation of October 1986, which liberalized <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s stodgy securities practices and was designed to make <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the world's leading financial center While the liberalization boosted <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s securities industry into a $ 43 billion-a-year business, lawmakers and consumer groups lobbied for the new law to guard against unethical practices that victimize investors. Under the new law, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> oversees five self-regulatory organizations responsible for policing the financial markets and enforcing provisions that ensure firms have enough capital to operate. Brokers and investment professionals operating without authorization face criminal sanctions ranging from fines to imprisonment. The new law also requires investment advisers to become more knowledgeable about client finances, investment goals and willingness to take risk. Many in the industry have complained that the new system is a hodge-podge of regulations that are difficult to understand, expensive to enforce and a threat to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s international attractiveness as a securities market. Some say the enforcement cost will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars and drive business elsewhere. `` We think that is a very real fear,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He also claimed the law would not be as effective as many of its supporters believe. `` It is wrong to think that the new measures will prevent fraud and do what the politicians want, which is to catch crooks more quickly,'' <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said. But some consumer advocates claim the regulations do n't go far enough and fear the cost will be passed to investors. Some have complained because provisions for compensating customers who have lost money through the collapse of firms wo n't go into effect for months. `` What we're saying to investors is, ` Do n't be lulled into a sense of security,' `` said <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, a research manager at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Under <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s financial deregulation, brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks, an activity previously restricted to firms called jobbers. The deregulation also abolished minimum commissions and allowed banks to enter the securities business. But less than two months afterward, several embarrasing securities scandals surfaced, inciting criticism that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district was not properly policed The biggest scandal by far has involved stock manipulation allegations surrounding brewery giant <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday, reflecting a belief among traders that the American economy is strengthening and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are rising. Gold prices fell. Foreign exchange dealers said the announcement that the March <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> index of leading indicators rose 0.8 percent, together with other signs of upturn, gave a positive picture of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. They said the announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> increased its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5 percent further convinced the market that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are rising. Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreigners. The day's dramatic moves appeared in British sterling trading, following the announcement of better-than-expected British trade data. Dealers said the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> intervened to smooth the pound's rise. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 1.61 billion from $ 2.48 billion in February, the government said Friday. In late trading, the pound was quoted at $ 1.8785, slightly more expensive for buyers than $ 1.8755 late Thursday. Other dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> late Friday compared with late Thursday included: 1.6725 West German marks, up from 1.6705; 1.3910 Swiss francs, up from 1.3832; 5.6805 French francs, up from 5.6685; 1.8745 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8715; 1,242.00 Italian lire, up from 1,240.50; 1.2280 Canadian dollars, down from 1.22965. Japanese markets were closed for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s birthday. The dollar was quoted at 124.80 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, fractionally down from 124.82 yen at the close of business Thursday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Gold prices in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Friday were quoted at a price of $ 449.25 a troy ounce, down from $ 451 late Thursday.

In a speech to 1,500 bankers and finance officials from 47 countries, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said his country wants to recycle up to $ 30 billion in trade surplus funds. One way is by increasing its stock in the 21-year-old development bank, <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> said. He said the bank, established to hasten economic development of poor <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> countries, has to expand technical assistance to developing countries and increase loans not only to governments but also to private businesses to reduce poverty in the region. `` If <ORGANIZATION> ADB </ORGANIZATION> is to respond to these issues and to achieve growth, it is imperative that the bank's own financial base be strengthened, for it is upon this foundation that all operations rest,'' he said. `` And I believe that a general capital increase is urgently needed.'' The bank currently has an authorized capital of $ 22.8 billion. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told the annual meeting of the bank's board of governors that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wants to increase its share in the bank's capital from 15 percent at present to at least 16.41 percent. `` And I hope the governors will give this request their favorable consideration,'' he added. But <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, opposed any capital increase, saying, `` Financially, the bank remains in excellent shape.'' `` At this time, my government does not foresee agreement on a -LRB- general capital increase -RRB- before early 1990, and clearly our position on these negotiations will be much influenced by our perceptions of the bank's plans for using its resources,'' he said. Sources at the bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is trying to expand its influence over the bank by increasing its shareholdings and thus have the most votes at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is faced with budgetary difficulties and cutting back on expenses. The bank, set up in 1966, is owned and controlled by the governments of 18 developed states and 29 developing Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries. Policy is formulated by the board of governors, which meets every year and is composed of the 47 member-countries' finance ministers or central bank chiefs The bank's annual report for 1987 shows that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had a slight edge over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, controlling 15 percent of total shares and 12.4 percent of total voting power, against 14.7 percent and 12.2 percent for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended almost unchanged Friday as a fickle market shrugged off some good news about the nation's trade outlook. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at 1,802.2, off 2.2 points, or 0.1 percent. There was a slight, short-lived rally after the government reported an unexpected sharp drop in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit in March, to a seasonally adjusted 854 million pounds, or $ 1.61 billion, from 1.32 billion pounds, or $ 2.48 billion, in February. Private economists had expected a deficit of 1.1 billion pounds, or $ 2.07 billion. `` There was a reasonable bit of euphoria after the trade figures, but the main institutions did n't buy with any follow-through,'' said one equity salesman, adding that when Wall Street opened lower, it added pressure to the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. Around midafternoon, share prices continued their slump after news that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regional bank, <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, raised its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5 percent, troubling market players about the outlook for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates.

 Stock prices were broadly lower today, extending Thursday's slow-motion decline in continued quiet trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.63 points on Thursday, dropped 14.92 to 2,026.36 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outpaced gainers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall count of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 450 up, 979 down and 485 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> raised its prime lending rate from 8 -LCB- to 8 -RCB- percent. Analysts said the move came as no real surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money rates that help determine banks' cost of funds. In fact, interest rates in the credit markets showed signs of steadying today after rising on Thursday. Still, analysts said stocks were still suffering from a dearth of buying interest among both individual investors and professional money managers. The market showed little reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in March The figure came in close to advance estimates. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> dropped \ to 47 -RRB- despite the company's report Thursday of record first-quarter profits.

 Soybean futures prices rallied in the last hour of trading to close sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grain futures were mixed. No single factor sparked the runup in soybean futures but revised weather forecasts, predicting less rain in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> than previous reports played a role, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Government estimates for a low carryover of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stocks into the next marketing year have put the market on edge, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said `` The soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather because if we do n't have a good crop this year they're going to cut that carryover down to the bone,'' he said. Overall support stemmed from persistently bullish underlying fundamental and technical factors, he said. `` First and foremost, you've got to remember that we're in a bull market and in a bull market, prices go up,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. Wheat futures closed mixed while corn futures finished slightly higher.

 Financier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court, whose fortune dwindled from billions to millions in October's market crash, sold most of his stake in his <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> business empire Friday. Two investor groups said they paid a total of 333 million Australian dollars, or about $ 253 million, for a nearly 40 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which has interests in a variety of industries. The sale reduced <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court's stake in <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which controls 43 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, to about 3 percent. The announcement ended days of speculation about the future of the once-feared corporate raider and also tolled the end of an era in Australian business. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court, who at the peak of his success was one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s wealthiest men, earning an estimated $ 43 every second, is reported to have become tired of corporate life, particularly in the wake of the stock market crash. The companies he controlled lost about $ 380 million, the biggest corporate loss in Australian history, due to investment writedowns in the wake of the global market collapse. Under the deal announced Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a brewing and media magnate who won the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup in 1983, each purchased 19.9 percent stakes in <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The commission said it paid the equivalent of $ 1.90 a share for its stake, or about $ 122 million. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, who made his purchase through <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 2.05 a share, or about $ 131.5 million. Both parties said they regarded their holdings as investments only and noted that they did not collaborate in purchasing Bell shares. <ORGANIZATION> SGIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Wyvern </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> said the government authority would not interfere with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s management. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court is expected to remain chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director Calling <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court's decision to sell most of his <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> holdings `` undoubtedly difficult,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was satisfied with its investment and had no plans to try to acquire the rest of the company. Since the market crash <ORGANIZATION> Holmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been selling assets to help ease his cash crunch. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> have sold off assets valued at about $ 3.42 billion. In November, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sold <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s 12.3 percent stake in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil giant <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> for $ 795.5 million, taking an esimtated $ 96 million loss on the transaction. Earlier that month he also sold a 2.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Broken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proprietary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s largest company, to other interests for nearly $ 200 million. He sold some of his properties in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> for about $ 140 million. <LOCATION> Broken </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, which has major interests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere, had been threatened in recent years by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, which amassed an 11 percent stake in the company through several takeover bids. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> approved of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s asset sales so far but did not want the company to divest its <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> owns one of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s three commerical national television networks. Its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> could raise questions as to whether <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is in violation of the government's media cross-ownership laws, which limit the size of investments in television and newspaper concerns in the same city. Separately, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court dropped his plan to merge <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, giving way to a pair of corporate raiders bidding for Bell Resources. Bell Resources, a mining and investment concern, is the subject of a $ 684 million takeover bid by Sir <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brierley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The merger proposal was seen by many analysts as a move to simplify <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> a Court's corporate structure after the October stock market crash, to put togther <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION>'s cash and investments with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial operations, and therefore to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s heavy borrowings.

<TEXT>
 The government's chief economic forecasting gauge recorded its second big monthly gain in March, a 0.8 percent increase that economists said should spell good news for Republican presidential election chances. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the March increase in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed a revised 1.3 percent February advance, which was the biggest gain in 14 months. In other good economic news, the government said sales of new homes, which had fallen for three consecutive months following the October stock market crash, posted a 4 percent increase in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 655,000 units. Those reports followed word Tuesday that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a healthy 2.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. It was a far better performance than the recession many had expected in the aftermath of the 508-point stock market plunge last October. `` The big worry at the beginning of the year was that a recession would derail the Republicans, but the leading indicator is just one more sign that this is n't going to occur,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, called the string of upbeat reports `` terrific news on the future state of the economy. `` From the point of view of the administration, the news on the economy could hardly be better,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the advances in the leading index were `` significant and good news. They suggest that the economy remains on a steady course and that a healthy climate for prosperity will continue.'' The unexpectedly strong growth has raised some fears that inflation may become a problem, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to hike interest rates in an effort to cool off demand. But analysts said that while they expect both inflation and interest rates to pick up modestly in the next six months, they do n't expect either to increase so quickly that they will raise voters' concerns. `` The strong economy will be more of an ally to Republicans than a rise in inflation and interest rates will be an adversary,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> said he did not look for interest rates to increase by more than one-half to one full percentage point between now and Election Day, which he called too small of an increase to be worrisome to voters. The February rise in the leading index hd initially been reported as a smaller 0.9 percent gain. With the revision, it is now the strongest monthly increase since a 2.2 percent rise in December 1986. The February and March strength represented a significant turnaround in the forecasting gauge, which is composed of 11 forward-pointing business barometers designed to predict economic activity six to nine months into the future. Following the market collapse, the index posted three consecutive monthly declines in October, November and December, the traditional signal of an impending recession. However, with the latest revisions, two of those declines have now been eliminated, although a 1.2 percent drop in November and a 0.7 percent fall in January remain. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the initial declines exaggerated the economy's weakness, but he cautioned against getting too optimistic based on the big February and March advances in the index. `` The economy is still growing. We wo n't have a recession this year, but we wo n't have a boom either,'' he said. The March increase in the index reflected widespread strength as six of the nine available indicators showed gains. The biggest gain came from a rise in stock prices, followed by a drop in weekly unemployment claims. The government said Thursday that weekly unemployment claims had dipped to their lowest level in almost 15 years, fueling speculation that the April unemployment report, due out next Friday, will show the jobless rate declining to 5.5 percent. It fell to a nine-year low of 5.6 percent in March. Other barometers showing strength last month were a slowdown in delivery times for businesses, an indication of rising demand; an increase in building permits; faster growth of the nation's money supply; and an increase in raw materials prices, which the index views as a positive sign that demand for these products is increasing. Three indicators held the index back. The biggest negative factor was a drop in the length of the average work week, followed by declines in orders for plant and equipment and demand for consumer goods. Analysts said the drop in the work week should be viewed as a positive sign that employers are adding more workers to their payrolls rather than trying to get by with a smaller workforce and more overtime. The various changes left the index at 193.3 percent of its 1967 base of 100.

 The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Friday, boosted slightly by fresh data indicating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy remains healthy. Gold prices were mixed. Republic National ~ ank quoted bullion at $ 450 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, unchanged from late Wednesday Traders said the dollar firmed on a government report that the Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March. The announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> increased its prime lending rate to 8.75 percent from 8.5 percentZfurther convinced the market that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest res are rising. Higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to foreigners. But despite the apparent -LCB- trength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, investors are shying away from aggressive dollar-buying because of | the implications strong indicators have on the trade `` A good <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is not good for the trade deficit'' because it means Americans are continuing to buy foreign goods, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the day's activity occurred in her currencies Investors bought the British pound following the announcement of better-than-expectedpFritish trade data.

Overall, however, the dollar traded in a narrow range. `` There still is not enough reason to get out of the trading range,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There is ... to buy or sell dollars at this point,'' he said. Japanese markets were closed for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s birthday. Traders said activity was light, particularly because of the absence of Japanese investors.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported losses for the first quarter which they blamed on higher costs. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the eighth-largest airline, said its first quarter net loss narrowed to $ 83.3 million from $ 93.6 million a year earlier. Revenue jumped 18 percent, to $ 900.8 million from $ 763.1 million in the first three months of 1987. St. Paul-based <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, said it had a first quarter net loss of $ 43.5 million, widened from a loss of $ 35 million in the first three months of 1987. The loss occurred despite an increase in first-quarter revenue, to $ 1.24 billion from $ 1.17 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said an improved performance by its Northeast shuttle service and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> helped narrow its loss from a year earlier. The air shuttle links <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> provides ground services to other carriers in airports around the world. The company's main subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, posted an operating loss of $ 62 million in the first quarter, widened from a $ 51.1 million loss a year earlier. The deterioration was blamed on increases in the costs of fuel, advertising, aircraft rentals and other expenses. The loss at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest airline, was attributed to rising costs and a strike threat by flight attendants. The company said its earnings also were affected by a $ 10 million one-time writedown of accounts receivable from a travel wholesaler. `` Higher fuel, payroll, travel agent commission and maintenance costs combined with the threat of a flight attendant strike contributed to the increased operating loss,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. He said that compared with the first quarter of 1987, the price of fuel for the airline jumped by 7.3 cents a gallon to 59.2 cents, payroll expenses increased 7.4 percent to $ 407.8 million, and commissions paid to agents were up 22.1 percent to $ 192 million. Maintenance salaries and material expenses rose as the airline accelerated its overhaul of spare engines, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said. The company reached a tentative contract agreement with its 6,700 flight attendants on March 22, averting a strike set for March 29. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union local representing the attendants announced earlier Friday that the contract had been ratified through a mail-in vote. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also said it was informed Friday by its flight attendants union that the attendants had voted to reject a new contract calling for $ 90 million in wage cuts and other labor concessions. The contract has been ratified by the unions representing pilots and flight engineers at the airline, and negotiations are ongoing between management and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The company underwent a major management shakeup in January in which the chairman and other top executives were replaced. To ensure its financial recovery, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> would need labor concessions totaling around $ 540 million over three years, analysts and company sources estimate. The concessions agreed to by the pilots and flight engineers represent about $ 240 million over three years, while the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union has informally accepted $ 35 million.

 Some late buying of smaller `` secondary'' issues enabled the stock market to finish mixed Friday in another slow-motion session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.95 to 2,032.33, closing out the week with a net gain of 17.24 points. Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in the daily tally on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 748 up, 738 down and 491 unchanged. Declines had earlier predominated by as much as a 5-2 ratio. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume came to 135.62 million shares, just a bit above the 1988 low of 128.68 million recorded Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index lost .46 to 147.87 <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> raised its prime lending rate from 8 -LCB- to 8 -RCB- percent. Analysts said the increase came as no real surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money rates that help determine banks' cost of funds, and no large money-center banks moved to match it. In fact, interest rates in the credit markets showed signs of steadying after rising on Thursday. Nevertheless, analysts said stocks were still suffering from a dearth of buying interest among both individual investors and professional money managers. The market showed little reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.8 percent in March The figure came in close to advance estimates. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 | to 18 -RRB- The Wall Street Journal quoted entertainment industry executives as saying several foreign companies were looking <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> over as a possible acquisition candidate. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Casualty dropped 1 -LRB- to 42.

As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market dropped $ 6.56 billion, or 0.25 percent, in value.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Soar On Weather Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Forecasts for dry weather in the western Corn Belt sparked a buying binge among soybean futures traders Friday, sending prices soaring to new contract highs on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grain futures were mixed. On other futures markets, livestock and meat were mixed, energy futures were mostly lower; precious metals were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. Government estimates for a low carryover of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean stocks into the next marketing year have focused the market's attention on the weather as soybean planting begins. Forecasts earlier in the week had predicted nearly ideal planting conditions this weekend in the western Corn Belt followed by rain early next week, which would get the newly planted seeds off to a good start. But new forecasts issued Friday painted a different picture for the coming week. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted warmer and slightly drier weather than normal conditions for the region in both its 30-day and 90-day forecasts. `` The soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather because if we do n't have a good crop this year they're going to cut that carryover down to the bone,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat futures closed mixed while corn futures finished slightly higher. Wheat settled 2 cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 3.04 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.02 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 1.59 \ a bushel; soybeans were 11 \ cents to 13 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 6.89 -LCB- Cattle futures settled steady to slightly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light trading that reflected nervousness about last week's government reports showing larger-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattend for slaughter. `` Based on the cattle-on-feed report, we should see substantial fed cattle marketings coming out,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` If that happens and the market ca n't handle it, we'll see prices break.'' Pork futures were mixed to lower due to an increase in the average daily slaughterhouse kills this week, he said. Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent higher with June at 70.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .22 cent higher with May at 78.67 cents a pound; hogs were .25 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at 48.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .35 cent lower with May at 51.35 cents a pound. Crude oil futures fell sharply in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid pessimism about the ability of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to agree on production cuts, but the market recovered and settled nearly unchanged. Oil ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> met Friday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, to discuss an export-reduction proposal offered by six independent oil-producing countries. Friday's expiration of the May heating oil contract spurred light buying of heating oil futures late in the session, which helped support crude oil, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-area oil distributor. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with June at $ 17.99 a barrel; heating oil was .08 cent lower to .82 cent higher with May at 51.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .16 cent lower with May at 51.67 cents a barrel. The lower oil prices weighed on precious metals futures at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where gold finished nearly unchanged and silver advanced slightly. Gold settled 10 cents to 40 cents higher with June at $ 452.60 a troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 3.2 cents higher with May at $ 6.498 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.4 points lower at 261.

<HEAD>Voluntary Recall of 1988-Model 626, MX-6 for Throttle Defect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> announced a voluntary recall Friday of 1988-model 626 and MX-6 cars, saying a throttle defect may prevent the engine from slowing when the accelerator is released in cold weather. The recall covers all 1988-model 626 and MX-6 cars sold in the mainland <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but excludes cars sold in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON>. Of the 72,883 cars in the throttle recall, 42,810 of the 626 models are also being recalled to replace defective automatic shoulder belt mechanisms. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries caused by either problem, the company said. Cars should be returned to a <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> dealer. The throttle problem is caused by frost that may accumulate when the car is driven at highway speeds in cold weather. The accelerator pedal becomes hard to press, and when the driver takes his or her foot off the pedal, the engine continues to run at the same speed, <PERSON> Aikins </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Dip Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices were pushed and pulled by speculation over interest rates and rumors of a stock-bond swap Friday before ending the session narrowly lower. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year bond fell 3-16 point, or about $ 1.87 per $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield was unchanged at 9.10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Riggs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> raised its prime lending rate from 8.5 to 8.75 percent. Analysts said the increase came as no real surprise, given the recent rise of open-market money rates that help determine banks' cost of funds, and no large money-center banks moved to match it. But the move was enough to jostle the bond market, which began to speculate that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would tighten credit, thereby sending interest rates higher. When interest rates rise, bonds lose value. However, the credit markets did n't stay down for long. `` There was speculation that money has been moving out of equities and into bonds,'' said <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist with the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> bank holding company <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Bond prices rallied sharply, but then settled back as the rumors died. Analysts said there was little conviction in the market. `` The bond market is likely to mark time until more economic statistics come out,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, an economist at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment and mutual-fund management firm of <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Farnham </LOCATION>. Traders were looking in particular toward the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on April unemployment, due out on Friday In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments ranged 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower, intermediate maturities were unchanged to 3-32 point lower and 20-year issues were off 1-16 point, according to the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.13 to 110.23. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, fell 0.36 to 1,151.80. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.21 to 278.14. Tax-exempt municipal bonds were down 1-16 point. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 5.99 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose 1 basis point to 6.35 percent and one-year bills were up 2 basis pointsto 6.67 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell to 7 percent from 7 1-16 percent late Thursday.

 Nervousness about the outcome of talks between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers has sent oil futures prices lower for a second straight day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, contracts for June delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 29 cents to close at $ 17.98 a barrel. The contract lost 33 cents on Wednesday. Among May contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.53 cent to 51.83 cents a gallon, and wholesale heating oil fell 0.80 cent a gallon to 50.97 cents. Analysts said traders were reluctant to take strong positions before the completion of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings going on in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were faced with a Wednesday offer by six non-cartel producers to cut their output by 5 percent for two months, if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> did likewise. The move would be intended to reduce world supplies and bolster prices. Talks among the cartel members over the proposal adjourned with no decisions and were to resume late today. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said traders remained skeptical `` about whether these meetings will accomplish anything,'' Accordingly, Thursday's market was dominated by `` a lot of profit-taking by traders who believed the market had come up too quickly'' in recent week, he said.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest bank remains committed to acquiring a large stake in <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> but acknowledges its chances have dimmed given strong shareholder reception of the rival hostile tender offer by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Thursday that nearly half of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s outstanding shares had been tendered so far under its $ 1.08 billion buyout offer of roughly $ 64 a share in cash and stock <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, which is offering to acquire a 45 percent stake in Irving for $ 75 a share, has no immediate plans to raise its offer but still believes it is the better deal, <PERSON> Lino </PERSON> <PERSON> Benassi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BCA </ORGANIZATION> deputy general manager, said Thursday. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> stock fell $ 2 to $ 60.62 -LCB- a share Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that our -LRB- current -RRB- offer is the best offer because we provide a lot of cash ...,'' <PERSON> Benassi </PERSON> said in an interview. He also conceded, `` I do n't think our chances are extremely good'' of winning Irving shareholder approval of <ORGANIZATION> BCA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal. The Italian bank's stock purchase is part of a complex restructuring proposed by <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> also would have the right to buy an additional 10 percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was consummated. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which holds a 5 percent stake in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s 18.5 million shares outstanding. The tender offer, which has been extended three times, was set to expire today. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said that at the close of business Wednesday, 9.03 million of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s outstanding shares had been tendered. Those, along with the 888,634 shares <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> already owns, give it 53.96 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s shares, the company said. `` We feel we're right on track, but we do n't want to become overconfident. We're still engaged in a proxy fight,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The bank is running a slate of 16 nominees to <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s board of directors. The Irving shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 6. Banking experts noted that the shareholders who had tendered their stock to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> still could change their minds should another, better proposal surface, but said another offer appeared unlikely. `` I think they -LRB- Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- are definitely in a strong position. They have the inside track, so to speak,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said his company has no comment on <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s latest announcement <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s proposed restructuring includes the sale of assets, such as its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, cost-cutting measures, and a $ 10-a - share special cash dividend <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> values the entire Irving plan at around $ 69.50 a share. The <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> proposal still needs regulatory approval from both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian authorities. Some analysts say that could work in <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s favor because it already has received conditional approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> boards for its merger plan. <PERSON> Benassi </PERSON> said he was confident <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> would receive all the necessary approval, although he admitted it could take a few months to achieve. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> recently noted in a four-page internal memorandum that it would have to `` revisit'' the policy issues posed by the fact that 62 percent of the Italian bank is owned by the government agency <ORGANIZATION> Instituto </ORGANIZATION> per la Recostruzione Industriale. There are no clear-cut policies for foreign government-owned banks seeking to merge with domestic banks. The last time the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> examined such issues was in 1982, when <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> acquried <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> took 15 months to approve that application.

<HEAD>Supermarket Chain Agrees To $2.2 Billion Buyout</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s attempted escape from an unwanted suitor through a $ 2.2 billion leveraged buyout by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm may not be the end of the takeover battle, some analysts say. Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, said Thursday it had agreed tentatively to go private in a cash and stock leveraged buyout led by <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, van <ORGANIZATION> Amerongen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier Thursday, Lucky again spurned friendly merger proposals by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which said it was prepared to acquire Lucky for $ 60 a share. American launched the bidding a month ago with a $ 45 a share tender offer that still is outstanding, but <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> rebuffed that offer and a later proposal by American to pay $ 50 a share in a friendly merger. `` I think we could easily see the bidding war continue,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials declined to return repeated telephone calls on Thursday. Lucky shares jumped $ 5.37 -LCB- to $ 61.50 in heavy trading Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as speculation of a bidding contest heated up. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 1.12 -LCB- to $ 61.50 a share. Under the agreement with <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, the firm will launch a $ 61 a share cash tender offer for 35.7 million Lucky common shares, about 92 percent of its 38.6 million common shares outstanding. The remaining 2.9 million shares would be exchanged for preferred stock with a stated value of $ 7 each, according to a joint announcement by the two companies. So as a whole, Lucky shareholders would receive $ 56 a share in cash plus $ 7 in stated value of preferred stock for each of their Lucky shares. Assuming the preferred stock trades at slightly less than its face value, as analysts believe is might, the entire package could be worth about $ 2.18 billion in cash and stock. The buyout was conditioned on financing being obtained, a majority of Lucky shares being tendered and other conditions. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said it expected bank financing to be committed shortly. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or with money raised by the sale of its assets. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said it would retain current Lucky management and employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` We believe it -LRB- Lucky -RRB- is the pre-eminent supermarket company in the areas of its operations,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a partner in the firm. Analyst <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> questioned whether <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> would renew its bid, although she said it could afford a new offer of as high as $ 65 a share. But <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Sutro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said: `` I do n't know if we've heard the last from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. A merger of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and Lucky would create the nation's largest supermarket chain, surpassing <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>' initial offer for Lucky in late March came about 1 -LCB- years after <PERSON> Lucky </PERSON> derailed a hostile takeover attempt by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> by undergoing a major <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, the third-largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operator of grocery and drug stores, has about 1,620 outlets in 40 states. Lucky employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets, including 340 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>A-Day Regulation Hits City of London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Today is A-Day in the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ the appointed day that the core of a sweeping new system for regulating the financial services industry takes effect, touching almost everyone involved in the $ 43 billion business. The new regulations, imposed under the Financial Services Act of 1986, are aimed at better protecting investors. But industry critics call the new system a confusing hodge-podge of vague regulations that could cost hundreds of millions of pounds to implement, are hard to comply with and could drive business out of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and into other financial centers. `` We think that is a very real fear,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Consumer advocates claim the regulations do n't provide enough protection for investors and that their costs will be passed on to consumers. While the act's major protections take effect today, the long-awaited rules are being introduced piecemeal and some have been postponed. The system replaces a former combination of government regulation, self-regulation, and in some areas _ such as the giving of investment advice _ no regulation at all. `` It plugs quite a few gaps,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the new regulatory system. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, criticized for its alleged laissez-faire attitude toward financial fraud, has been trying to determine how best to protect investors while overseeig the financial services industry, which it deregulated under the so-called `` Big Bang'' in October 1986. The government has transferred responsibility for industry regulation to the 17-member <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a new non-government watchdog body with statutory powers. The board in turn has approved five self-regulatory organizations covering different financial services sectors, which will authorize firms and individuals to operate. These so-called `` SROs'' will police the approved firms, which will be required to comply with tough capital-adequacy regulations. The rules require investment advisers to be more knowledgeable about their clients' finances, investment goals and willingness to take risks. Failure of firms and individuals to obtain SRO authorization constitutes a criminal offense carrying a maximum sentence of two years in prison and unlimited fine. Under the Big Bang deregulation _ most of which took place Oct. 27, 1986 _ brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks, an activity previously restricted to firms called jobbers. Deregulation also abolished minimum commissions and allowed banks to enter the securities business, among other things. But less than two months after Big Bang, stock market scandals involving <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and others broke, prompting criticism that the City _ <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district _ was not being policed properly. In the Guinness scandal, seven men including <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>' former chairman and chief executive officer were charged after <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that its former management manipulated the company's stock price to make a 1986 cash-and-stock offer for <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> more attractive than a rival bid <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, of the industry association, said `` It is wrong to think that the new measures will prevent fraud and do what the politicians want, which is to catch crooks more quickly.'' There are other gaps. For example, the act does n't cover Lloyds of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the self-regulating insurance market. Furthermore, provisions for compensating clients who have lost money through the collapse of firms wo n't go into effect for months. `` What we're saying to investors is ` Do n't be lulled into a sense of security,''' said <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>, a research manager at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. More than 5,000 of the industry's players, or more than 10 percent, have not yet obtained SRO approval to operate. The approval process was so cumbersome that <ORGANIZATION> SROs </ORGANIZATION> have granted interim authorization to firms to meet today's deadline. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> said: `` If and when we get the financial services regime up and running ... we should have a very advanced system of regulation in this country that will provide an increased measure of protection for investors. How long could that take? `` Something like two years,'' he said.
