<HEAD>Defense Forces, Noriega Resist; Loyalty Remains Strong Enough</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Instead of collapsing when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> threw its military might against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, his Defense Forces stubbornly resisted. The elusive general the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had hoped to put before a federal judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug charges remains at large and in hiding despite an attack Wednesday by thousands of American troops. Many in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had thought the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> would simply `` throw down their guns as soon as an American helicopter appeared over the barracks,'' as a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponent once put it. In interviews prior to the attack, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military leaders had claimed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> troops would refuse to shed their blood for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Part of their evidence stemmed from the fact that disloyal officers mounted two coups against him. But the general, who sometimes seemed to escape by magic, apparently retained enough loyalty for his men to put up a fight when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stroke came. From Defense Forces posts all over <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> came reports of stubborn fighting that lasted for hours. With their garrisons destroyed or under siege, many Panamanian officers left and joined small paramilitary groups in urban guerrilla warfare. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had heavy artillery and air power to use against installations and sent their armored personnel carriers rolling over fences and cars, Panamanian armed groups fought a delaying action. `` We are acting as urban guerrillas, although we have lost some positions, some garrisons,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the second in command in the paramilitary groups, known as Dignity Battalions. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> spoke with an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter as the five men with him took up positions in the bushes with Soviet-made AK-47 rifles near the Tinajitas garrison, taken over Wednesday morning by the Americans. `` The people are joining the struggle for national sovereignty,'' he said. The Noriega forces marshalled resistance with appeals over the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, broadcasting in a national network. Announcers called on Panamanians to organize neighborhood armed resistance and guerrilla war. The station played Panamanian patriotic songs that taunt Americans. Officers even used it to broadcast instructions to troops and messages to each other, often in code. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces finally did slowly close down the radio stations that made up the chain, but it was a slow process. `` Incredible,'' said a sweaty <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant as he listened to the exhortations. `` That was the first thing we should have silenced.'' Unlike the armed forces in other parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> officer corps is made up largely of men from poor backgrounds and became the vehicle dictator <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> used in the late 1960s to topple the ruling oligarchy. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a Torrijos disciple, once observed that the upper-class had only itself to blame when they complained about the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' dominance, because they preferred to make money. He openly mocked the upper-class and his supporters frequently refer to the opposition election victory on May 7 as an effort by the oligarchy to return to power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> promoted officers with poor backgrounds, often from discriminated-against black and Chinese minorities, and worked hard to retain their loyalty with lucrative slices of the corruption pie in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But when that loyalty slipped, it did in coup attempts in 1988 and 1989, he reacted brutally, and reports that he personally beat or shot coup instigators circulated. Accused of domestic repression by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, he whipped up nationalistic feelings showing himself as a Panamanian wrongly accused by the large country that wanted to renege on the the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. The invasion was a slap in the face to Panamanians who have considered themselves friends and allies of the Americans since the two countries joined hands in the construction of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> at the beginning of the century. As the armored personnel carriers rolled out of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> after midnight Wednesday past the Panamanian town of <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, some men and women watching them cursed them or cried. `` Whey are they doing this?'' a housewife asked a reporter. `` Are they going to kill our people just for one man?'' `` The Americans have no control of the situation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomas </LOCATION> hospital. `` Their strength is in their personnel carriers and their Cobras -LRB- helicopters -RRB-, but the people are angry.''

 This first installment of a three-part Christmas series about the relatives of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> deals with his ancestral roots.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Everyone is a special sum of ancestry _ to enhance or diminish through a lifetime. That was so for the child of Christmas, the product of a heritage. Some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery, before time itself. But others accord him a thoroughly natural family tree. `` He was in the beginning with God,'' says one account, a `` Word'' or `` Logos,'' a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the Creator before the world began. Yet other passages say he was `` made like his brethren in every respect.'' `` Son of man,'' he usually called himself, but also `` Son of God.'' He combined `` universality with particularity,'' the `` divine and human model,'' writes church historian <PERSON> Jaroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelican </PERSON> in his book `` Jesus Through the Centuries.'' It says a key question put to him was, `` Where do you come from?'' Although seldom noted, he had a long string of forebears as well as contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help. His lineage ran deep into Jewish history. As with most people if their descent is traced back far enough, he had a checkered ancestry, good and bad, the lowly and great, kings, betrayers, heroes, adulterers, warriors and prostitutes. It was an odd assortment, like humanity itself, alien Gentiles and fellow Jews, the weak and strong, upright and corrupt. The fact that he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic to his purpose: becoming identified with all humankind. They `` were all members of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' family, his great-great-great grandaddies and grandmamas in the faith,'' wrote church scholar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willimon </PERSON>. `` For all their weaknesses and shortcomings, this motley but richly human crew were indeed his people.'' Two genealogies of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> are recorded, one in the first chapter of the Book of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, the other in the third chapter of the Book of <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>. They vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably assume <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> gives the line of his mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, and that <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> gives that of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, legally the father. `` It is possible that the original genealogy did interpret <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> as the father of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, that is, that it had been formulated before the understanding of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as the divinely generated son of God,'' writes New Testament scholar <PERSON> Henrikus </PERSON> <PERSON> Boers </PERSON> in his book `` Who Was <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>?'' Some progenitors are on both lists, including olden patriarchs of Judaism and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s great King <PERSON> David </PERSON>, along with other lesser figures of sundry character. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> lists 41 ancestors, starting back at the time of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, ancient father of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and other early patriarchs, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> lists 77 progenitors in reverse order, starting with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and enumerating others going back to the first man, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, and finally to his creator, God. Other figures out of dim antiquity also are included, such as <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>, and that legend of longevity, <PERSON> Methuselah </PERSON>, who lived 969 years, all designated ancestors of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. In the mostly male lists, four women are named, and they're a mixed group _ a soldier's beautiful wife, <LOCATION> Bathsheba </LOCATION>, seduced by King <PERSON> David </PERSON>; the harlot of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rahab </PERSON>; the sexually maneuvering Cananite, <PERSON> Tamar </PERSON>; and the loyal Mohabite, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tamar </PERSON> was the daugher-in-law of <PERSON> Judah </PERSON>, son of the patriarch <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>. Her husband died and after prolonged widowhood, she disguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her father-in-law to lie with her. She bore twins, one named <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, also among <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' forbears <PERSON> Rahab </PERSON> was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the Israelite warrior-leader <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> to spy out <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> before taking it. She hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop. She later helped the pair escape, lowering them on a rope from a window in her house, which was built into the city wall. By agreement with the two, her clan was spared when <PERSON> Jericho </PERSON> was destroyed, her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window. The devoted woman of <LOCATION> Moab </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, widowed by her Hebrew husband, insisted on returning with her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, with these memorable words: `` For where you go I will go ... your people will be my people, and your God my God.'' On <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON>'s advice, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> worked in the harvest, sleeping at the feet of the owner, <PERSON> Boaz </PERSON>, thus winning him as her husband. They were parents of Obed, father of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, who fathered King <PERSON> David </PERSON>. His philandering with <PERSON> Bathsheba </PERSON>, the gorgeous wife of an absent military officer, <PERSON> Uriah </PERSON>, produced sons <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> and future King <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, alternatively listed in <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' line of descent. Other men on the lists also displayed foibles, such as <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s deceiving his father to gain an inheritance, and even <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> fearfully palming off his lovely wife, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, as his `` sister'' to placate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Nevertheless, those honored patriarchs also displayed courage, initiative and devotion in their covenant with God to lead a people that would be a promised `` light to the nations.'' The great Israelite military commander, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, successor to <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, also is listed, along with a long succession of kings, decent and debauched, in addition to charming, psalm-singing <PERSON> David </PERSON> and wise <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, credited with the Book of Proverbs and builder of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s first Temple. Other kings include <PERSON> Rehoboam </PERSON>, whose oppressions, idolatrous rites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom; <LOCATION> Uzziah </LOCATION>, stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign, and <PERSON> Hezekiah </PERSON> who led reforms under guidance of the prophet <PERSON> Micah </PERSON>. Also listed is <LOCATION> Manasseh </LOCATION>, described as `` the most wicked king of <PERSON> Judah </PERSON>,'' whose religious deviations included Baalism, exaltation of the idol Astarte, wizardry and <PERSON> Molech </PERSON> worship that involved forcing children through fire. Tradition has it that <LOCATION> Manasseh </LOCATION> had the great prophet <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> sawed asunder. One king listed, <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON>, took the throne at age 8 when his father, <PERSON> Amon </PERSON>, was murdered. But <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> had a long, just reign, ousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost `` Book of law'' in repairing the Temple. Of many others named, some are clouded, uncertain figures, while others are notable in Jewish annals, such as <PERSON> Judah </PERSON>, founder of a main Israelite tribe, and the prophet <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> who rebuked <PERSON> David </PERSON> for his illicit affair. The mixed lot of people, with their sundry faults and strengths, were all `` part of the promise fulfilled'' by the Christ child, <PERSON> Willimon </PERSON> writes. They, `` for all their weaknesses, ... were instruments of the promise.'' On the other hand, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' descent also is traced directly to the Godhead, adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity. `` In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,'' says the distinctively interpretative gospel of <PERSON> John </PERSON>. `` And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.'' He is `` fully God and fully man,'' classic Christian doctrine says. His conception by the virgin <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> is ascribed by the gospels to divine intervention. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> calls him the `` image of the invisible God.'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> himself, though he was generally elusive about it and though he identified closely with common folk, sometimes laid it out plainly, as related by <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s gospel: `` Truly, truly, I say to you, before <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> was, I am,'' he said. `` I and the Father are one ... the Father is in me and I am in the Father.''

 A soldier who led a failed coup attempt in one of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s nominally independent black homelands has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for high treason. Warrant Officer <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phiri </PERSON> was the last of 142 soldiers to be sentenced for their roles in a February 1988 coup attempt in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, one of four tribal homelands designated independent by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> but not recognized abroad. The other defendants, convicted last month of treason or terrorism, were sentenced Monday and Tuesday to prison terms ranging from 2 to 10 years. The coup was crushed by South African commandos, who freed homeland president <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> from captivity at a soccer stadium and arrested the rebels, all members of the homeland army. <ORGANIZATION> Bophuthatswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> M.W. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Phiri </PERSON> was `` a danger to society'' who had allowed <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON> to be ill-treated during the coup attempt and had ordered his rebels to fire on the homes of homeland Cabinet ministers.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the alderman and lawyer assassinated by a mail bomb, is being remembered as an easygoing, generous man whose community affairs work made people `` believe they can make a difference.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whom even new acquaintances called `` <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>,'' died Monday when a package containing an explosive and nails blew up at his law office. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> had planned to attend a meeting that evening at the lawyer's church to discuss how blacks could fight drugs in their neighborhoods. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was black. The 42-year-old attorney was the second victim in a rash of mail bombs in the South. A package bomb killed 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> on Saturday. A mail bomb found at the federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was disarmed Monday. A parcel bomb mailed to the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, office was disarmed Tuesday. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>'s legislative offices were closed in mourning. <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` was a warm, kind person, always with a smile on his face and a hand out to help.'' `` He meant the future to <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, he gave to the community in such a selfless way that he made people just believe they can make a difference,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. At a news conference, city leaders said they believed <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which he represented in a school desegregation case, was related to his death <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was an active member of his church and was worked to help the homeless. Friends said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s political activity was not the kind that would be expected to generate murderous enemies. `` I've known him a very long time, and he is not the kind of guy I would think would be a target of such an action,'' said Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadsden </PERSON>. `` He was easygoing and went about his business.'' Longtime friend <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> took part in civil rights protests until he went off to college. `` Then he came back, got into politics and his time began to get tight.'' <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had been a city councilman for eight years, but had served on other government and community boards his entire adult life. As city transit authority chairman 10 years ago, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> led a move to provide transportation for the poor and the elderly. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, one of the first black students to attend <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s, represented the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in the long-running <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> schools desegregation case. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in October that the city's magnet-school plan was appropriate for desegregation. Neither city nor school officials knew whether the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> was planning to appeal, and NACCP head <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, and three daughters. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said city officials would start a fund for <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s family. <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> said a local business, All-American Builders, had already donated a $ 1,000 reward for information in the case. `` We are sure the <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will not quit until they come to some conclusion,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Meanwhile, the fund gives people a way to prove their love for <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 In contrast to the largely peaceful changes in other Eastern European countries, President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> appears determined to use force to defend his hard-line regime. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, the most senior Soviet bloc leader after 24 years in power, has said reform-minded Communists elsewhere have betrayed their people by refusing to defend Marxist orthodoxy. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s refusal to embrace change has isolated him from all his <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies. Some analysts say he is seeking stronger ties with rigid Communist systems similarly opposed to political reform, particularly <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His leadership is based on a family dynasty with some 40 relatives reportedly placed in key state and party jobs. His wife <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, virtual second-in-command in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, is a Politburo member and first vice premier. One of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Ilie </PERSON>, is an army general and deputy defense minister. Another brother, <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Andruta </PERSON>, is a police general and deputy interior minister and another brother, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON>, is in charge of economic planning. His youngest son, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, 39, is a Politburo candidate member and party chief of <LOCATION> Sibiu </LOCATION> region in southern <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is a showcase for any repressive totalitarian state. The harsher the repression, the more violent the public upheaval it brings about and the greater the desire to take revenge on leaders,'' <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratiu </PERSON>, chairman of the London-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> of Free Romanians, said Monday. Since he became party leader in 1965, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has exercised absolute power and carried out a foreign policy independent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. While that maverick stance won him praise and credits from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> kept Romanians under iron-fisted control. Now, with reform ascendent in the rest of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, the harsh Romanian stand draws condemnation from abroad. About 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the <LOCATION> Jiu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in 1977 and 10,000 workers demonstrated in the city of <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> in 1987 demanding freedom, better living conditions and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ouster. Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders disappeared. An extensive secret police force keeps strict control on religious and political expression, and dissent is quickly crushed, making chances for peaceful change in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> seem remote. But poverty and despair engendered by economic problems and political repressions could cause people to risk direct confrontations with armed forces, as in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> now. Unlike recent protests in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, witnessed and reported by the Western media, demonstrations in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have taken place well outside the public eye. The Western reporters permitted into the country in recent years have been kept under close watch, and police have detained journalists and even diplomats attempting to visit the country's few dissidents <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has closed its borders and barred most foreigners from entering the country in an apparent attempt to prevent the spread of news about the <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> protest, the largest demonstration against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s policies since the <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> riots. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has little tradition of democratic rule. After five centuries under the Ottoman Turks, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> won independence in 1877, becoming first a monarchy, then, during the Second World War, an ally of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The last monarch, King <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, was forced to abdicate in December 1947 under threat of civil war and pressure from the Kremlin and its Romanian Communist allies.

 Two leading art auctioneers are reporting more than doubled yearly sales with the market for impressionist, modern, and contemporary art racing to dizzying heights. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s fine art auctioneers on Tuesday reported worldwide sales in 1989 of $ 2.9 billion, a 61 percent increase on 1988. And <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s reported worldwide sales in 1989 of $ 2.2 billion, a 69 percent increase. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ainslie </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: `` The opportunities for forming major collections have never been better as the flow of significant works onto the market is stronger than we have ever witnessed. `` More collectors are participating in our business, and balanced competition from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become a regular feature of the international art auction market.'' <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s said auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art worldwide during its autumn sales season this year alone accounted for $ 797 million of overall sales. Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Christie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement: `` The strength of the market has been underpinned by the growth in world wealth and the emergence of new buyers into the arena.

 Gen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON>, who drafted the `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> first'' strategy under which the allied coalition led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> won World War II, is dead. He was 92. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON>, who had Alzheimer's Disease, died Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belvoir </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> was a temporary lieutenant colonel when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entered the war in December 1941. His first major assignment came earlier that year when President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> asked the then War Department for suggestions as to how to win the war that the nation was surely going to have to enter. Gen. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON>, at that time the only American officer to have graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general staff college, drew up what became known as the `` Victory Program,'' advocating the defeat of German armies on the continent of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by allied ground troops. After the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry into the war, a refined version of the plan was adopted by <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Winwston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, and, despite a few detours, led to the invasion of <LOCATION> Normandy </LOCATION> in June 1944 and the defeat of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wedemeyer </PERSON> stayed with the War Department until October 1943 when he was made deputy chief of staff to British Adm. Lord <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Montbatten </PERSON>, the commander-in-chief of the Southeast Asia Command.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says he regrets possibly misleading the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public about a secret trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> taken by two high-level <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman Tuesday night `` he felt obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission the president wished to have classified.'' Speaking for <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> added: `` He regrets that he may have misled some ...'' It was the first acknowledgement of error since the White House announced on Dec. 9 that national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> were visiting <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Their trip was roundly condemned in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as a friendly gesture to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a cancellation of the ban President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> imposed on high-level exchanges after pro-democracy students were massacred in early June in Tiananmen Square. Another sanction crumbled Tuesday night when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved to end a ban that prevented the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Export-Import bank from providing financial aid to companies doing business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Also, the White House announced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had approved the export of three communications satellites expected to be launched by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, saying the deal was in the `` national interest.'' Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s approval of the satellite export licenses `` a true outrage'' and `` another effort to curry favor with the hardliners in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and an insult to the memory of those who died for democracy in Tiananmen Square. Criticism also mounted on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> against this month's visit by Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as well as an earlier one in July `` To have sent two of our highest level officials to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the president look like a wimp in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a hypocrite in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a leading congressional spokesman on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> issues. In defense of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` It is not misleading to not tell you about everything he's doing. The president's up there in the Oval Office doing things all day long that you do n't know and wo n't know about and that's not misleading.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 10, called the trip taken in early December to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> `` the first time we've had high-level <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials go to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On Monday, however, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> also had made a secret trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in July. Asked about the apparent discrepancy, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had explicitly acknowledged the December trip by <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> `` was not the first time we had high-level contacts'' with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the crackdown. She noted that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> mentioned on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> his own meeting in August with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> at a conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` He specifically referred to his own contacts,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` But he felt obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission that the president wished to have classified. `` He regrets that he may have misled some, but he felt that by acknowledging his own direct involvement it was sufficient to make the point that this was not the first case of high-level contact.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch of U.S.-manufacturered satellites on Chinese rockets unless the president declares it to be in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national interest, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done. The <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is selling the satellites to firms in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for launching on a Chinese rocket. `` Approval of these licences is in keeping with the president's policy not to disrupt normal commercial relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' a White House statement added `` These satellites are intended for civil use and represent significant investments for the firms, based in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` It is in the national interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to approve export licenses for the three satellites currently being prepared for launch in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The White House also cited `` national interest'' in waiving restrictions on the Export-Import bank's financing of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business activities within <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The White House said the waiver `` preserves a level playing field for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business. Additional business activity with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be considered on a case-by-case basis as part of a continuing review process.'' One of the few on Capitol Hill who has supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s overtures, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said sending Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to underscore human rights concerns `` was exactly in conformity with the congressional position, which reflected the views of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. But Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the administration did what it told us they were not doing. `` Surely the Chinese would see it that way. If we send the national security adviser to the president, there is no sanction from the standpoint of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. I do n't buy that distinction at all,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> is ushering in the Christmas season with a bang. Several hundred children squealed with delight Tuesday night when a loud boom and burst of flames from an exploding hydrogen balloon signaled the start of the Lebanese-born professor's 20th annual Christmas science show. It's called `` Once Upon a Christmas Cheery in the Lab of <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON>,'' and he's taking his popular chemistry lecture this season to <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Standing on the stage of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> auditorium, <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> doffed his tuxedo jacket, black bow tie and ruffled shirt and set to work wearing a `` Science is Fun'' T-shirt. For the next hour, he captivated his audience of more than 600 kids and their parents with a demonstration of `` the beauty, the magic and the adventure'' of science, often using ordinary household chemicals found in vinegar, laundry detergent and disposable diapers. As <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> performed his scientific sleight of hand, bottles popped their corks, a metal can collapsed, a phony dollar bill vanished in a puff, a dishpan overflowed with fog, clear liquids turned into Yuletide greens and reds or glowed in the dark, and a gooey yellow stuff kept oozing out of its glass jar like a yogurt machine gone haywire. While a visiting <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> applauded from the front row, <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> delivered his show-stopping finale, shaking a flask containing silver nitrate, ammonia, sugar and other ingredients to produce a giant, shiny Christmas tree ornament. Then he made his pitch to the wide-eyed youngsters. Have fun and work hard in school, he said, and think about a career in science or mathematics `` because our country needs you.'' <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON>, whose first name rhymes with `` Shazam'' and means `` Smiley'' in his native <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, emigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with his parents in 1957. He is a chemistry professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at Madison on leave as assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an independent federal agency that awards grants to colleges and public schools for scientific education and research. It was at the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> campus that <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> delivered his first Christmas lecture `` for kids of all ages'' in 1970. He borrowed the idea from <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraday </PERSON>, the great English chemist and physicist whose Christmas science lectures for children were popular in the 1840s. `` I'm trying to share the excitement and joy of doing hands-on science,'' <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I do n't try to snow anybody with technical details. My idea is to capture their interest and not allow them to extinguish their flame of curiosity.'' <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> is disturbed by a foundation estimate that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> faces a cumulative shortfall of 450,000 native-born college graduates with bachelor's degrees in science, math and engineering by the year 2000, and a projected shortage of 8,000 scientists with doctorates by 2004. `` It's very, very alarming,'' he says. The nation desperately needs highly trained scientists to tackle such challenges as the superconducting super collider, space stations, human genetic mapping and the AIDS epidemic, he says. `` What's at stake is the pre-eminence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in science and technology and the global economy, and the quality of life not only in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but on earth,'' <PERSON> Shakhashiri </PERSON> said.

 It was a big bull, but it did n't sit well outside the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The 3-ton bronze bull sculpture, which turned up uninvited Friday outside the exchange, is being moved to a park in the Wall Street area, said city <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON>. The city yanked the sculpture from its spot outside the market last week, but it has changed its mind.

 A spy plane that was one of the mainstays of Cold War intelligence-gathering today was marking its 25th anniversary with a flight over its maker's once-secret plants. The SR-71 Blackbird was to take off from <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42 in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> and fly over <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plants in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> and Rye Canyon. An SR-71 first flew on Dec. 22, 1964. Since then, Blackbirds, which can fly at least three times the speed of sound and higher than 85,000 feet, have helped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence keep watch on sensitive areas around the globe. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week signed a defense appropriation bill that did not include funding for the SR-71. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials had advocated dropping the program. The Blackbird _ angular, with short wings and enormous engines _ replaced the U-2, a high-flying but slow craft.

<HEAD>Soviet Miners to Visit; Solidarity-like Support Promised</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> says it will host a nearly month-long visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by 10 Soviet miners seeking to form independent unions and promises to support the miners even if it has to defy the Soviet government. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, president of the 14.1 million-member labor federation, announced Tuesday that the delegation would arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Dec. 29 for a nearly month-long stay. The visit will begin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and bring the miners to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Jan. 3. A more detailed itinerary was not available, but the delegation plans to visit some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mines to study mining and safety practices, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. The miners will be the guests of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> but their trip is being paid for by through a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> exchange program. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has repeatedly refused torecognize visits by members of government-sanctioned Soviet unions, arguing those are little more than puppet organizations. The miners requested the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s support last month and <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, likening their struggle to that of Solidarity organizers in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the early 1980s, promised American unions would deliver. `` If necessary,'' was <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>'s response when asked if the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> would take the same steps it took to support Solidarity, which included the smuggling of printing and other communications equipment into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during the period in which Solidarity was outlawed. In all, the federation gave about $ 5 million worth of equipment and other assistance to Solidarity. Although it refused to allow the federation delegation into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> noted that the Soviet government had allowed two trade union activists to attend the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent convention and had granted exit visas to the miners, all members of strike committees which have been at loggerheads with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. Because of those steps, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said it was clear `` there is a measure of glasnost'' in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy toward independent union activity and said that made it unclear whether the Soviet government would move to block <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> support of the miners. `` I'm interested in testing its limits,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said of the Soviet government. The Soviet miners scheduled to visit were among the leaders of strikes by thousands of Soviet miners beginning last summer. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was critical of the strikers, accusing them of undermining his efforts to revive the Soviet economy.

<TEXT>
 Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says he is moving quickly to correct problems that caused a congressional study to say <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has an `` extremely weak'' ethics review system. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s pledge came Tuesday following the release of a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study that said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was failing to make sure consultants filed financial disclosure forms and was not reviewing the ones filed by employees. `` We found that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s system for obtaining and reviewing disclosure statements is extremely weak, for its own employees as well as for experts and consultants,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fact that the problems we are reporting have existed for so long demonstrates to us that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary has not held the -LRB- ethics officials -RRB- sufficiently accountable for developing and administering an effective financial disclosure system.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said there have been three <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> workers who have filled in as the agency's chief ethics officer since <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> took over early this year, and said there has not been a staff and resource commitment to policing for conflicts of interest. `` It appears that to a large extent it is business as usual at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., who requested and released the report `` I am faulting Secretary <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, through <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> General Counsel <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, acknowledged the problems. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would hire a new chief ethics officer by year's end and would soon fully staff an expanded ethics department. A new ethics manual also will be published by the end of the year and all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees are being required to attend ethics seminars, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` There are still things that need to be done but they are being done,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. `` No one is having to make a convert at this department on the subject of ethics.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said it reviewed the files of 62 consultants hired by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> from 1986 to 1989 and that 52 had not filed required financial disclosure forms. The agency, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, also said that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> received 62 disclosure reports from employees who are required to file them but that the agency had not reviewed any of them more than 100 days later. Ethics law requires that the reports, designed to uncover possible conflicts of interest, be reviewed within60 days. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said most have since been reviewed and the rest would be scrutinized by Jan. 15. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the problems date back at least seven years and persist despite <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s promises to rid the agency of mismanagement, political influence and other problems blamed for a number of agency scandals during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It is the second time <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s administration has come under some criticism in a study of agency management. The department's inspector general issued an earlier report praising <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s plans to reform the oversight of agents <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts to sell properties but said the department's regional offices were slow in implementing the changes

 Democrats are attacking Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> for handpicking candidates to challenge <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' Democratic congressmen next year, but they say the senator's record of choosing Republican losers gives them little to worry about. Calling those who complain `` wacko,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> says the Democrats are running scared because `` 1990 does n't look like a good year for them.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a first-term Republican, is running for re-election next year and is not believed to be currently facing a serious challenge. His only announced opponent is Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Parmer </PERSON>, a former mayor of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The filing deadline is Jan. 2. While <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s people say the senator is concentrating on his own race, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, claims <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> has handpicked challengers to Reps. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> of Sulphur Springs, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarpalius </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. `` He's going into the district, handpicking the candidate, forcing him down the throat of the local <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then the candidate loses and everybody has hard feelings,'' <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON> says. `` He's being a real Lone Ranger, causing problems in his own party.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> intervened this summer in a special election to fill the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> seat vacated by former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> when he released a name recognition poll conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, signaling to local Republicans they should rally behind the physician. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> lost a close race to Democrat <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>. In 1985, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> helped create a congressional opening by recommending Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for a federal judgeship. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> backed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Edd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargett </PERSON>, who lost the election despite outspending <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> 3-1. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, however, says he's not handpicking candidates, merely talking to people who are interested in running for office. State <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Koops </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agree and say the senator is a tireless worker for the party. `` I've talked to 200 people about running for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, state representative, county commission, county sheriff. People who are interested in running for office talk to me,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. But several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats say <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s intervention damages the congressional delegation's bipartisan unity. `` It creates schisms and divisions that we do n't need, as well as bitterness _ there's no way better way to alienate a person than to go out and solicit someone to run against him. It's one of the most personally offensive things anybody could possible do,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says. `` I wish he would reconsider and consider the effect on the delegation.'' Countered <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was elected running against a long-time entrenched incumbent. Did that tear up the delegation? I think what's happening is that the Democrats are getting scared.'' With the delegation's clout at low ebb from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation and other setbacks, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> says <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>'s interference is particularly unwelcome as Texans fight to preserve federal funding for several state projects `` It's very difficult to work with a guy who spends all of his time trying to create political problems for you,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> says. `` He does it every two years _ the opponents he recruits always lose, but it creates an enormous amount of ill-will in the congressional delegation. He's hard to work with anyway, a shameless headline seeker, and this just makes it worse.''

<HEAD>NTSB Blames Deaths on Lack of Coast Guard Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal safety investigators are blaming the boat accident deaths of four people in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> last year on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to require lifeboats and a signal beacon on the vessel that carried them. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has tried for years to get the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to toughen requirements for an estimated 4,700 small commercial vessels that are equipped to carry 300,000 passengers. `` There has been a long, documented absence of regulatory action,'' said board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s 3-0 decision Tuesday was the first time it has said the service's lack of regulations contributed to deaths in an ocean accident. The Sept. 15, 1988, incident off the coast of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> involved the sinking of the Cougar, a 46-foot vessel used to carry passengers on a fishing trip. After the boat took on water and sank, passengers and crew were left in the cold <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, clinging to float devices and debris, for 18 hours as searchers tried to locate them. The captain, a deckhand and two passengers died. A ship's mate and four other passengers survived. The last victim drowned 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued the others about 35 miles out into the ocean, west of <LOCATION> Depoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, investigators said. The board also blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for failing during inspections to confirm the watertightness of hatchcovers on boat's deck Its report said the probable cause of the accident was the captain's failure to ensure that his hatchcovers were watertight, that the bilge pump was operating properly and that rubber flaps designed to let water flow off the deck were correctly installed. The captain was not identified in the report. The flaps were on the wrong side, preventing water from flowing off the deck, investigators said. The ship sank in moderately heavy seas while returning from a fishing trip, after its crew and passengers tried for 90 minutes to remove water with buckets. The board for years has recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> require all passenger boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that emergency position indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers. In the last five years, the board has investigated five passenger vessel accidents, including two collisions, one fire, one capsizing and one grounding. In each case, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> survival craft requirements were found inadequate, but there has been no change in the regulations. The board recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> require that within five years all flotation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced by lifeboats, life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people out of the water. Passengers using flotation devices remain in the water where they can suffer from a rapid loss of body heat, or hypothermia. The board also advised the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to improve its testing rules and procedures and require all passenger vessel operators to file sailing plans before they set out.

 Mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire was heard in the capital Tuesday night as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks and truckloads of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops headed toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military headquarters.

 Machine-gun and cannon fire resounded through the capital Tuesday night as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks and truckloads of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops headed toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military headquarters in an apparent bid to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw 24 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks and at least four trucks carrying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops head in the direction of Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters on Tuesday night.

Channel 8, television station of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement by unauthorized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel was prohibited. The roar of planes and helicopters were heard over the city. Earlier Tuesday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces of violating its air space with `` observation planes and helicopters'' in preparation for military action. Frequent movements of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and equipment have been seen within <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations the past three days, and appeared to escalate Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls the Panamanian military and the country, since he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions have depressed the economy, but have not budged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and two coup attempts _ most recently in October _ failed to unseat him. An NBC News broadcast Tuesday showed what it said were C-141 Starlifter transport planes landing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the afternoon. It said one plane was landing every 10 minutes and that security had been tightened around the air base. Later Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter and a <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> reporter were detained for about an hour by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police when they tried to enter <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> air base to determine whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were landing. The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the two reporters were released without incident. An AP reporter who drove through <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> air base Tuesday night saw at least 10 large transport planes, an unusually high number. There also were six to eight helicopters parked there, in contrast to the usual three or four. It was not clear what kind of planes they were or whether they transported troops or cargo. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said earlier Tuesday `` no unusual military activity'' was taking place. Later he said he knew nothing about the reported arrival of C-141 planes. At <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, tanks were pulled into a circle in an open area and troops climbed on and off them in routine cleaning and exercises Tuesday afternoon. Trucks and armored personnel carriers also were moved into public view. Telephone lines to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> offices at <LOCATION> Quarry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and to officers' homes were busy late Tuesday. Access to Quarry Heights is limited, but a public road goes through <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Earlier Tuesday, C-141 planes were seen in the air around <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 82nd Airborne division. It was not known if they were connected to any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activity in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> spokesmen would say only that <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units there were taking part in a routine `` emergency deployment readiness exercise.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Feibel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the division, said he had no information on reports that some of the division had left <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division -LRB- Light -RRB- were mobilized Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, also for a readiness exercise, said base public affairs officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` As a matter of policy, we do not address destination, unit size, unit designation, or times of departure,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> added. Lt. <PERSON> Pascual </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, director of civil aviation, said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has `` a critical situation'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We think the level of aggression and intimidation will increase,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are helicopters flying during the night over our installations,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s declaration last week that a state of war existed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by `` indiscriminate and unprovoked violence against Americans, clearly increases tensions in <LOCATION> Panma </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> would not say what contingencies or options were under consideration. Panamanian officials say the American officer was killed when he and three others drove a car past checkpoints, then fired at <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military headquarters building, wounding two civilians and a soldier. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the four were unarmed, in civilian clothes, when they got lost near the headquarters. Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, 25, who had been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since September, was killed when the group fled civilians and soldiers who tried to force them from their car at the checkpoint, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said. On Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer wounded a Panamanian police corporal because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon, according to Southern Command. Police Cpl. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON>, who was shot once in the left arm, told journalists permitted to interview him in a hospital Tuesday the American had initiated the incident. `` I was merely standing there, doing my job, when this car went by at high speed and the driver fired two shots at me,'' he said. `` I never gave him a reason for it.'' Journalists also were permitted to interview another patient, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, who said he belonged to the security detail at military headquarters. <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said he was shot in the arm Saturday by the Americans. Southern Command officials have said repeatedly the only shooting was by Panamanian troops. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the drug charges.

 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchage </ORGANIZATION> reversed its early downswing and edged up Wednesday, while the dollar firmed against the Japanese yen. The dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen It started trading at 143.92 yen and ranged between 143.90 yen and 144.25 yen.

It lost 147.08 points Tuesday on rumors the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> might raise the nation's discount rate by the weekend. Market players, however, avoided making major moves amid uncertainties over the discount-rate increase, said <PERSON> Tomoyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Morimoto </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Many market players were reluctant to make major moves amid uncertainty over the discount rate hike,'' he said. `` Few people will be inclined to buy further until they find out what exactly will happen to the rate.''

In currency dealings, trading was quiet in the absence of fresh market-affecting news ahead of the Christmas holiday, traders said. `` Although the market was hectic yesterday due to the rumor about the discount rate, it no longer has any impact here.

<HEAD>Social Security Pushing for Faster Catastrophic Refunds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is supporting a plan under which the government early next year would mail monthly refunds to millions of elderly people overcharged for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premiums. If the plan goes through, Social Security beneficiaries who unavoidably will be overcharged by about $ 5.30 a month for their Medicare coverage early in 1990 will be simultaneously issued monthly refund checks. The overcharges are the result of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' late action in repealing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s catastrophic health-care program. Social Security contends its computers ca n't be adjusted by January to halt withholding of the extra Medicare premium for catastrophic coverage. As a result, nearly 27 million Social Security beneficiaries who have <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks are expected to be overcharged from January through May. Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Tuesday a panel of experts convened by the agency to study the problem suggested issuing monthly or bimonthly refund checks to offset the overcharges, or sending out lump-sum refunds late in the spring. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which actually issues Social Security checks, reported that lump-sum refunds were the most feasible option and that monthly refund checks would be `` much worse than the other two scenarios.'' However, Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> did not expressly rule out the possibility of mailing monthly refunds, so she will `` send back a signal that that would be our preferred option.'' She said she would ask <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to advise her on whether it can provide monthly checks. `` That option ... appears to be the best way to get money back as quickly as possible,'' Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in an interview. `` My purpose has been to try to make the beneficiaries whole. They should not have to pay for this problem. The question is how can we get them this money.'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency has been meeting with Social Security `` to identify the most expeditious way to achieve the refunds. At this particular point, nothing has been decided.'' Social Security initially had said it probably would issue the refunds in lump sums late in the spring. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s statement that she would push for monthly refunds came on the same day that two congressmen sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a letter asking him to support that option. Reps. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said retirees should not have to pay _ even temporarily _ for a program that wo n't exist `` For seniors, this is n't just a matter of principle _ it's a matter of meeting rent payments, buying food and paying utilities,'' <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated the cost of issuing monthly refunds at $ 25 million to $ 30 million, and said the first refund checks could be in the mail by February. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said each extra monthly mailing would cost about $ 10 million.

<HEAD>Many Long Distance Phone Rates to Drop in 1990</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many long distance telephone rates to points in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad will be going down after the first of the year, the three major long distance companies say. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> filed reductions with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> said they will take action to remain competitive. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> says it has about 70 percent of the long distance market, as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> is No. 2 with more than 10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> claims 7 to 8 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T reductions will take effect Jan. 1, barring an unusual action by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to block them. The company said the reductions were taken in line with an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> price cap which has been reduced because local telephone companies are charging long distance companies less for access to customers' lines <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's submission to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> called for $ 300 million a year in reductions on interstate and international long distance services used primarily by residential and small business customers. Other categories of service used by businesses, such as private lines and 800 and 900 numbers, are not affected. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON> said the No. 2 long distance company also will reduce its rates to pass on the savings in local telephone company charges. `` We will remain competitive with them,'' he said. `` I do n't know how much our total cost savings will be.'' <PERSON> Hauser </PERSON>'s counterpart at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pence </PERSON>, said, `` We are reviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive.'' The company said price reductions will apply to its `` Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' and optional long distance plans as well as to basic long distance service. A 10-minute call during daytime hours on a weekday, to anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, will cost $ 2.50 or less, a decrease of 1.3 percent on the average, the company said. Some of the increases would be greater. For example, a 10-minute daytime call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which now costs $ 2.30, would decline to $ 2.20. Daytime hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time Monday through Friday. In the evening, the rate for a call to anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will drop by an average of 2 percent, the company said. An evening call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, which now costs $ 1.67 for 10 minutes, would be $ 1.58. The evening period is 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday. Weekend rates are in effect all day Saturday and until 5 p.m. on Sunday and the same rates apply from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sunday through Friday. These rates will not change. The maximum for such a call is $ 1.32 for 10 minutes within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the company said. Discounts for subscribers to the Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 24-hour plan will be increased from 5 percent to 10 percent on weekday calls and from 20 to 25 percent on evening calls. Under Reach Out <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the evening period is 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Friday. International calls from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland to 25 of the most frequently called countries and overseas areas will be slashed by $ 104 million. The reductions will vary from country to country and the countries will include <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A five-minute call from anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> between 2 and 8 p.m., now $ 8.72 at the standard rate prevailing in those hours, will drop to $ 8.07. A similar call to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> between 1 and 6 p.m., when discount rates are in effect for such calls, will decline from $ 4.21 to $ 3.99. Calls to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will decline from 2 to 20 percent, depending on the time and the city from which the call is placed. A five-minute call from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, now $ 7.90 at the standard rate, will drop to $ 5.90. Five minutes from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, now $ 6.15, will cost $ 5.55. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said the reduction will be the company's 10th since 1984 and would bring total rate decreases to 40 percent in the six years since the breakup of the Bell System.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secret dealings with the repressive government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> suggest a double standard in the way the administration views <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the rest of the world in terms of human rights and aspirations for democracy. With the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for example, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demands that human rights stand as a centerpiece of the superpower relationship. Yet with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is moving to resume business with its aging, hardline leaders even though they remain doggedly unrepentant about the June massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators and continue to suppress their citizens. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approved the export of three communications satellites expected to be launched by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and he moved to end a ban that kept the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> from aiding companies doing business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Winston Lord, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until last April, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not have reversed course so swiftly if the killings had occurred in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Breaking with the administration because of its secret diplomatic missions to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overtures were a sign of `` cultural, if not racial, bias.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been an outspoken champion of democratic reforms that are toppling hardline communist regimes from power in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Along those lines, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday denounced the `` systematic denial of human rights'' in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and called on its government to cease the `` brutal repression'' that some witnesses say has left hundreds dead. It is a message that could be aimed just as easily at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has muted his criticism of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and he only reluctantly accepted sanctions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. An old <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hand, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken the position he knows better than his critics. It's hard to judge exactly what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing since he refuses to talk about it publicly. `` You see,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explained to reporters, `` I still believe that sometimes to effect change, you talk in confidence to people.'' He insists his secret dealings do not amount to condoning the repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` That is not a good rap and it is not true,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. As for the secrecy of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s actions, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> says the president's conduct of foreign relations `` will, from time to time, involve him in making trips, making contacts, talking to people and keeping it secret.'' The administration's actions have sharpened tensions between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on foreign policy and are sure to be an issue of contention when lawmakers return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There probably will be congressional hearings on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The flash point of dispute is the two secret missions to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by presidential emissaries <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, his deputy secretary of state. Reluctantly, the White House revealed that Scowcroft and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had traveled to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> barely a month after the crackdown. The purpose, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, was to tell Chinese leaders face to face that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> found their conduct unacceptable. The news provided fresh ammunition for opponents of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policies `` To have sent two of our highest level officials to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the president look like a wimp in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and a hypocrite in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, demanded that the administration make a full disclosure of its contact with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Even before disclosure of the July trip, Democrats were up in arms about an announced visit by <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in December. Toasting Chinese leaders with words approved by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to bring `` new impetus and vigor'' to the relationship. In language soothing to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, `` In both our societies, there are voices of those who seek to redirect or frustrate our cooperation. We both must take bold measures to overcome these negative forces.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked to identify the negative forces in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Tuesday, `` I do n't know.'' He suggested that the question should be directed to Scowcroft.

<HEAD>North's Testimony in Poindexter Trial to be Limited</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Restrictions on <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony will make it more difficult to prosecute <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, says a former chief counsel to the congressional Iran-Contra committees. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements at his own trial are off-limits for use in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. North testified in April that he saw the former national security adviser tear up a presidential finding retroactively legalizing <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> assistance for a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified last week that his recollection on that and other matters was influenced by <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s immunized appearance on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in 1987. Therefore, said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial testimony as it relates to <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> may not be used, unless it was a subject which <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> did n't address in his immunized testimony. The court's obligations require it to `` err on the side of protecting <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s constitutional right not to be convicted with the use of his own testimony,'' said the judge. Prosecutors `` may only elicit evidence'' from North based on his statements prior to July 15, 1987, the day <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> began testifying on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said the judge. By saying he was tainted, <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` has snaked his way around'' the issue of having to testify about the finding being torn up, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nields </PERSON>, former chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority staff in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings. Since <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not tell the congressional committees in 1987 that he saw <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroy the finding, he `` wo n't be able to testify to it at the -LRB- <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> -RRB- trial'' and `` I do n't think the government has any other proof of it,'' said <PERSON> Nields </PERSON>. The government still could elicit information about the finding's being torn up if <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> decides to testify in his own behalf at his trial, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 22. The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal charges against the former national security adviser. He is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and two counts of making false statements. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed the December 1985 finding on Nov. 21, 1986, the same day he allegedly told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until early 1986 that the shipment had carried Hawk missiles. The prosecution says the finding which <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> destroyed is `` the most critical document in proving the falsity'' of another document, a chronology which is an essential part of the government's case against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The chronology contains the same false information which <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> allegedly gave to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ that no one in the government knew about the Hawk shipment until 1986. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel, was present when <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> tore up the finding. But <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said in a deposition to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in August 1987 that he did n't realize at the time it was the finding that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> was destroying. `` One document we came to he ripped up ... saying ` This is no longer necessary' or ` this has no future,''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> recalled in his deposition to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` That document turns out to have been the finding.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he learned it was the finding when he saw <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> admit it on television in his immunized testimony. North was convicted in May of three felonies in the Iran-Contra affair. He is appealing the convictions on charges of altering and destroying documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The obstruction charge was related to a November 1985 shipment of <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which also forms the basis of some of the charges in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case.

But <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was the big loser in the election, gained through lies and falsehoods,'' <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. `` He will govern in favor of big business, the armed forces, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its allies will form a shadow government to prevent Collor de Mello from committing abuses.'' With 96.7 percent of the ballots tallied, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 33,898,190 votes, or 42.7 percent, compared with 30,546,337, or 38.5 percent, for <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The rest of the votes were abstentions or nullified ballots. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezek </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that was supervising the tally, said <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> would be declared the winner Wednesday, but an official announcement would only be made Dec. 29. The election was the first direct vote for president in 29 years. Current president <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> was selected in an <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> vote strongly influenced by the right-wing military government that ran the country between 1964 and 1985. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> has been secluded in his <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> mansion. Aides say he will only address the nation after election officials proclaim him the winner. TV Globo, the nation's largest television network, ran a previously taped interview with the president-elect Tuesday night in which <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> promised a government with `` dignity, austerity and character.'' The new president's first challenge will be harnassing inflation racing at over 1,500 percent this year amid growing poverty. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s campaign advisers have told the press he will seek to heal the wounds from the electoral campaign and call for a government of `` national unity.'' However, the wounds run deep. In the campaign's final week, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>'s campaign made vicious personal attacks on <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> and said his party wanted to impose a communist dictatorship in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. `` I would never sit at the same table with <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. The low blows he used caused me to lose all respect for him,'' <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said at the Tuesday press conference. He said <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, scheduled to take office on March 15, will face strong opposition from labor unions and six leftist parties. During the electoral campaign, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> promised to end inflation, privatize state-run firms, reduce the size of government, and sell <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister's mansions to reduce the public deficit. He also won the vote of a great part of the uneducated rural poor by pledging to increase spending for housing, education and health care. To realize these promises, <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> must seek allies in the country's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The new president's party has 24 senators and representatives, only 3 percent of those in congress. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said his party would back <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON> if he sincerely attempted to carry out social reforms in this polarized society, where the richest 1 percent receives almost half the national income. `` But I'm afraid his call for national unity is nothing more than a trick to keep the working class quiet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Three days of hearings on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee to head nuclear weapons production have sharply divided the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel weighing the nomination, but yielded few signs of whether he'll be confirmed <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, nominated as assistant energy secretary for defense programs last July 24, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to act as soon as possible, but the panel is not expected to vote until January or February. Stello appeared before the committee in a first round of hearings Nov. 15 and 16. Three of the 11 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the committee _ Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> _ are strongly opposed to Stello, but most of their colleagues have not publicly taken a position. Among the nine Republican members, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and others have charged that the Democrats are trying to kill the nomination by stalling and raising what they say are irrelevant and unsubstantiated charges about Stello's professional background. Stello worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and its predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for 26 years before going to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last summer as a special adviser on the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant. In a separate development Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a report showing that the new operator at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was given $ 3.9 million in federal award fees this year despite serious safety lapses, including two instances of reactor workers sleeping on the job. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> was applauded for making some important improvements at the plant since it took over last April, but the department cited numerous `` anomalies,'' including cases of radiation alarms being deliberately disabled by workers. Stello, in a final statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` it is our country that is suffering'' because of a leadership vacuum in the weapons program. He described the weapons production complex as being in `` a state of disarray.'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmound </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> is well suited for the job and that `` the real issue'' is whether opponents of nuclear weapons will allow confirmation of a man capable of rebuilding the production complex. Key production plants are shut down for safety upgrades, and many private groups contend the facilities no longer are needed for national security. <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, however, said Stello should be rejected because his record as a staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was spotted with evidence that he sometimes put nuclear industry interests ahead of assuring public safety. The department has been without a confirmed head of weapons production for more than a year. Of five former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> wo testified Tuesday, three strongly endorsed Stello's nomination and two raised serious doubts about his suitability. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrie </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and currently a consultant to nuclear utilities, said he has known Stello for 17 years and considers him `` a good manager and a natural leader. I recommend him to you in the strongest terms.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Asselstine </PERSON>, a commission member from 1982-87, said he has `` very mixed feelings'' about Stello. He called Stello technically qualified for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> job, but said <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> sometimes was too easy on those he regulated. <PERSON> Asselstine </PERSON> cited as an example a case in which Stello ordered his staff to rewrite proposed changes in fire protection standards for nuclear plants to satisfy objections from utilities. Stello later denied this allegation.

<HEAD>Exported No More, Steam Locomotives Now Arrive from China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Steam locomotives built in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area were exported to railroads around the world years ago. Now, two companies are importing from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 83-ton locomotives based on a 1918 American design. Two brand-new steam engines were unloaded from a freighter Sunday at the Beckett Street Terminal in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. New steam locomotives have n't been seen in this port since the 1950s, when the old <ORGANIZATION> Baldwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> went out of business It's been decades since efficient diesel locomotives made steam power obsolete on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> railroads, but steam engines have survived on short lines hauling tourists. Thousands of people visiting scenic and historic sites line up each year to ride on old-time trains, but even something as heavy-duty as a locomotive eventually wears out. `` The repairs we found necessary on our existing locomotives got the railroads thinking about new locomotives,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Railroad </LOCATION>, as he waited for the new steam engine at the marine terminal. The last place in the world that still makes steam engines is the <ORGANIZATION> Tangshan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, about 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Chinese still rely on steam locomotives because of their sturdiness, and because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has plenty of manpower and coal required by the old locomotives. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> went to the Chinese in 1986 to arrange a sale and soon afterward, the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> followed suit. <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> general manager, said the new engine would haul tourists through part of the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The main attraction of the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is the 300-foot-high, 2,053-foot-long <LOCATION> Kinzua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the highest in the world when it was built. About 17,000 people rode the <ORGANIZATION> Knox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> in 1988. The Valley Railroad carries about 130,000 passengers a year on its six-mile trip along the west shore of the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Valley Railroad President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrott </PERSON> said the $ 300,000 price for the new locomotive was worth it A delegation from Valley visited three locomotive factories in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and decided on the Class SY from <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> -LRB- SY stands for Shang You, Chinese characters meaning `` Aiming High,'' according to <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> -RRB-. Similar engines built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> early this century were nicknamed `` Mikados.'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> preferred the smaller model over a larger locomotive from a plant in <LOCATION> Datong </LOCATION>. He and his assistants also preferred <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION>'s construction methods and the willingness of the <LOCATION> Tangshan </LOCATION> engineering staff to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> boiler codes and railroad guidelines. When the new Chinese locomotive finally arrives in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Parrott </PERSON> said it will be their primary engine. She doubted that passengers would mind the locomotive was not an antique. `` The majority of people who come here just like to ride behind a steam engine,'' she said. `` Besides, the engine being new and coming from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may arouse some curiosity.'' After clearing customs, the locomotives are to be towed or hauled on flatcars by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> to their new owners.

<HEAD>US Officials Cite Progress in El Salvador, Despite Criticism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Responding to congressional unrest over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials say <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to that country is yielding substantial benefits in battlefield performance and in protection of human rights. A senior administration official who briefed reporters on Tuesday said leftist rebels were `` sadly mistaken'' when they assumed that the uprising they launched six weeks ago would produce a popular uprising. In addition, the official said, the armed forces are showing an increasing sensitivity to human rights concerns and, contrary to popular wisdom, there has not been a resurgence of rightist death squad activity. But Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, expressing skepticism about the wisdom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to determine if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid has been used effectively in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s long battle against the rebels. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the results of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigation will form the background of a congressional review early next year of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> The effectiveness of the large and continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid program is called into question by the strong rebel offensive mounted against Salvadoran government forces last month, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> with well over $ 3 billion in economic and military aid over the past decade. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he also wants to know if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel inside <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have any knowledge of the activities of right-wing death squads and whether they are required to disclose such information. A report issued over the weekend by <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based human rights organization, said rights violations in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> have been occurring at a `` breathtaking pace'' since the rebel offensive began. The report documents abuses by both government and rebel forces. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who briefed reporters on the condition that he not be identified, said the number of unexplained deaths, after a dramatic decline in the early 1980's, is still `` marginally down'' despite occasional `` blips.'' He said there is no hard evidence of a resurgence of death squad activities either as the result of the victory by the rightist party last March or of the offensive begun last month by the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> rebels. `` The offensive is falling apart,'' the official said, asserting that the rebels now are facing food and medicine shortages. He estimated that perhaps half of the rebel force of about 8,000 has been lost as a result of death, wounding, capture or desertions. The official said there is no conclusive evidence implicating either the military or leftist forces in the unsolved murder of six Jesuit priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> last month. But Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, D-Mass., a member of a special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating the murders, said Tuesday there is circumstantial evidence to implicate the Salvadoran military <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said this is the case despite the fact that during a week of questioning by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, a Salvadoran woman, Mrs. <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerna </PERSON>, withdrew her story that the night of the murders she saw armed men in military uniform near the priests' residence, heard their voices and heard heavy gunfire. This change in the woman's testimony did not justify claims by <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> officials that Mrs. <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>'s testimony has been discredited, thus proving that Salvadoran armed forces were not involved in the murders, <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said. `` There is other circumstantial evidence to implicate the military,'' <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON> repeated her original story to members of the special committee, declaring she had felt `` pressured'' to say she had actually seen nothing that night after her <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interrogators made it evident they did not believe her. `` She did change her story at that time but told us that she did so only to end the questioning of her,'' <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has denied `` absolutely and unequivocally'' allegations that she was mistreated during her interrogation.

 Defense planners are suggesting a possible two-thirds reduction in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as part of proposed drastic cuts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The options for troop cuts were presented to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, in a meeting Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, citing unidentified sources. No decisions have been made on the proposals, the newspaper said. Maj. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Super </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew nothing about the meeting reported by the newspaper. Overall in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the maximum amount of cuts contemplated in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing paper given to <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> would mean a reduction of 80,000 people from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> by the end of the 1994 fiscal year for a savings of $ 3.6 billion, the newspaper reported. Currently the Army has 32,052 people stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and options presented to <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> would cut that to a 5,200-person brigade and another 6,550 in support, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Construction Companies Pay in Bid-Rigging Settlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is being paid $ 32.7 million by 99 Japanese companies to settle bid-rigging charges that officials say raised construction costs of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base by 25 percent. The cartel of 140 companies had bid on construction of the base at <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Fair Trade Commission, which administers that country's antitrust laws, earlier had fined 69 companies 1.5 percent of the value of each company's contract, for a total of $ 2.2 million, and had warned 70 unsuccessful bidders not to continue in the bid-rigging arrangement Some companies offered to negotiate a settlement as a result of threats of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lawsuit in the Japanese courts and also in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts against 26 companies also doing business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the department said. The settlement, which involved 99 firms, was negotiated in November, the agency said. Japanese construction companies frequently collaborate on bids in a system called `` dango'' where the bidders decide who gets the winning bid. The 140 companies bidding for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts at <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION> formed an association in 1984 that called itself `` Seiyukai,'' or `` Friends of the Stars,'' a reference to the American flag.

<TEXT>
 The unrest in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> may be the beginning of the end for strongman <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who was hailed 24 years ago as a Soviet bloc maverick but is increasingly denounced for his repressive policies. `` We are definitely in the twilight of the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> era,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Larabee </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The Soviet foreign minister and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> both condemned <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s use of violence to crush demonstrations in the Romanian city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, where according to some reports as many as 400 people died. But <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with an iron hand since 1965, `` is going to be a harder nut to crack'' than communist leaders swept from power in the Soviet bloc nations of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a specialist in East European affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has been a maverick in the Soviet camp for decades _ boycotting <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact exercises, trading with the West against <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> wishes and most recently balking at the democratic reforms of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> may be able to survive in the short term, his days seem numbered, said <PERSON> Larabee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and other analysts. `` This incident or some other might open up an explosion of popular dissent, or some group in the leadership, such as the military, may decide to get rid of him. Sometime or another, something has to give,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Garthoff </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and now a senior scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The current unrest in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> began as a reaction to repressions against the Hungarian minority in the nearby cities of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arad </LOCATION>, along with the more distant city of <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, but reports indicate that ethnic Romanians may have joined the demonstrations. Experts say that is bad news for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was once a favorite of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders because he refused to allow Romanian troops to join <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> military maneuvers, was the only Soviet bloc leader to maintain full relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and traded with Western nations against the wishes of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In 1969, then-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> state visit to a Soviet bloc nation. <PERSON> Ceausesu </PERSON>'s widely reported human rights abuses chilled U.S.-Romanian relations, however, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year withdrew trade favors from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, costing that nation as much as $ 250 million annually. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> harshly criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemns the brutal use of police force by the Romanian government against protesters in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and other cities,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that if the reports of bloodshed were true, `` I can only express my very profound regret. We are categorically opposed to the use of force.'' <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has been a maverick since the late 1950s when <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s predecessor rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> plan to more closely integrate the Romanian economy into Soviet bloc by selling <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and its allies oil and other natural resources. Instead, the Romanians sold their oil to the West and used the money to industrialize. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> became party leader in 1965 and refused to allow Romanian forces to take part in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact exercises. He was the only <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leader to refuse to take part in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. He denounced the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 and refused to join the Soviet bloc boycott of the 1984 Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Throughout that period, the Romanians took advantage of the Sino-Soviet dispute, playing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> off against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. As reforms have swept <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has kept close ties with conservatives in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and counts as his closest allies hardline communist leaders in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who once called his opponent's bullets `` kisses,'' has been a shrewd and ruthless survivor who reveled in power and in thumbing his nose at what he called `` the colossus of the North.'' At about midnight Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces bent on toppling the military strongman engaged Panamanian troops less than a week after his rubber-stamp assembly named him head of state and declared a `` state of war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had eliminated political opposition, nullified the May 7 elections when they were going against him and repeatedly defied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which indicted him on drug trafficking charges in February 1988. It had long been known that `` Tony'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enjoyed a crisis and it was widely said that he would prefer death to losing power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who comes from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district where <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is located, has survived and created a mystique that won him the nickname `` The Man,'' the English word his initials spell. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it was part of the historic mission of his generation to take control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to take over the canal by the year 2000. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claimed his enemies were plotting to abrogate the canal pact. On Oct. 3, elements of the 15,000-man <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> he commanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him, but troops loyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally accepted the rebels' surrender. During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped his candidate the annulled presidential elections, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was seen standing alone before the tomb of his patron, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. The epitaph on the tomb is: `` I do n't want to enter heaven. I just want to enter the Canal Zone.'' <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accord with former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to turn over the canal. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> died in a plane crash in 1981, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became commander of the Defense Forces in 1983, giving him de facto control of the government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was raised by foster parents and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention of <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, then an ambitious young officer. In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to Colombian cocaine cartels. Less than a year after <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> took power in 1968 coup, he made <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was like having the keys to the city. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> immediately began compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The job also gave him close contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, and he formed powerful alliances. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who dealt with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at the time, on drug enforcement efforts, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was polite but when it came to something he wanted, he was `` the coldest man I ever met.'' After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired a fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood. His financial interests reportedly included a vast array of businesses including hotels, casinos, a television station, radio stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and prostitution. Rumors about his personal life were plentiful, but there were few facts. Even his age was disputed. The general has said he is 51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54. He is married and has a daughter who lives in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Although his private life is that of a rich man, he worked hard to develop a populist image modeled on the revered <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in this nation of 2.2 million. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his domestic opponents as rich and white. `` The humble, the poor and the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the people,'' he once said. As the standoff with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dragged on, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enjoyed underlining what he termed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s helplessness, despite the 12,000 troops it has stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> exercised power with ruthless assurance. He closed newspapers for months at a time, and presidents served at his pleasure. Rumors of opposition inside the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were met with purges and reorganizations. `` Kisses,'' was how he described the bullets fired in an attempted coup in March 1988. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, long his ally, began to distance itself after the headless body of one of his opponents, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadadora </PERSON>, was found in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mailbag in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in 1985. A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed crippling economic sanctions. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did n't budge. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, through his control of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, was named chief of government on Dec. 15 by a rubber-stamp assembly. It said his leadership was needed to confront a `` state of war'' caused by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general. He claims <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to oust him to make it easier for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. Shortly after the indictments in <LOCATION> Floria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> delivered a speech. He brandished a machete above his head, then brought it crashing down on the podium. `` Not one step back!'' he shouted.

 Statehouse races in 18 states will be targeted next year by Democrats who hope to control state legislatures when congressional districts are redrawn for the 1990s. Democrats will try to raise $ 3 million to help candidates for the legislatures in those states next year, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, who heads the party's Project 500 program, said Tuesday. Democrats are particularly concerned with states likely to gain or lose congressional districts as a result of population shifts that will come to light in the 1990 census.

The ads ran within the last five years. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to create an advertisement designed to educate consumers about home insulation, especially the importance of having heat-resistance information when making a purchase, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` The violations were technical in nature and did not result in any consumer complaints,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` There was no misrepresentation or deception involved.'' The settlement must be approved by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Q. Has <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> been captured yet? A. This operation began at 1 o'clock. The situation on the ground is such that we are not at liberty a this point to comment on the military undertaking. The operation is ongoing. We do n't know how long it will take. But that is our ultimate objective. It has not happened at this time. Q. On what legal basis was this operation undertaken? A. The legal basis was: First of all, the president's responsibility and duty to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens We have laid out in the past the number of threats to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. There have been literally hundreds of cases of harassment, of abuse and of situations that have caused us to believe very greatly that there is a threat to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens, there is a threat to our rights under the canal treaty, and the president has acted on that basis. Q. Was the president acting under intelligence reports that this operation has a guarantee or a certainty of success? A. The certainty of an undertaking like this is something that we obviously have confidence in. We would not undertake a military action that we did not believe was well planned and had a high degree and high chance of success. Q. Is this being done in conjunction with any of the Panamanian Defense Forces? Are any of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> forces joining in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? A. As I indicated, this operation began just less than a half an hour ago. There are no indications of those kinds of changes in the conflict that I can report at this time. Q. Was there any planning in conjunction with the Panamanian Defense Forces or is this solely a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation? A. I ca n't comment on those kind of planning operations. Q. The Organization of American States is urging the president not to do this. He has gone ahead and done it. Have you talked to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-? Have you had any change of heart from the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, any indications of how they're going to feel about this? A. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, as you will recall, considered this matter considerably following the May elections in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Those elections, as you also know, were thwarted by Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. All of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> saw the bloody shirt and body of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and the others who were beaten by Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the aftermath of that election. And the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> was very forceful in their consideration of this issue. And they sent a mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to try to urge the termination of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. And they passed a resolution urging that it be ended by Sept. 1. This evening, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are calling various leaders of Latin American countries, members of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> as well as allied leaders and others. We believe we do have support of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and the Latin American countries.

 Q. Is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the Panamanians is scheduled to occur on Jan. 1 have anything to do with the timing of this operation now? A. I do n't think is has to do with the timing, but it certainly has to do with the substance. We do have a responsibilty under the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> for its safety and security, and we do believe there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty. And that is one of the aspects of our purpose here. Q. Can you give us any details of A, how it's going, B, what the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force that was amassed for this was and how long you think this operation might take? A. I really ca n't answer any of those questions in any great detail. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committing forces we believe are adequate to the task. It is a major undertaking. There are numbers of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task. But I just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of logistical characterization of the size. The president has been considering this matter for several days. As you all know, he was quite disturbed by the events of last weekend involving the killing of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and the harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife. The president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a plan and the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action. Since then there have been any number of meetings. I will not go into details of when and how they were conducted. But the president has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since Sunday. And there really has not been any question about our willingness or our readiness to proceed since that time. Q. What are the troops' orders with regard to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? Were they ordered to try to take him alive? And if they do, what do you want them to do with him? A. Their orders are to apprhenend Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and our purpose is to return him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution under our laws regarding drug trafficking. Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the southern district of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the northern district in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. And we want to bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution under that indictment. Q. Who swore in <LOCATION> Endara </LOCATION>, under what legal authority and where is he now? A. I do n't know who swore him in. The legal authority of course was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the May elections and they are assuming office on that basis.

 Q. Where are they now? A. I do n't have their exact location. Q. Since this is a declaration of war, why did n't the president come out and announce it himself? A. The declaration of war was set by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, not by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so do n't get that confused. The president is acting here to safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives, to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty, to secure the person who is under indictment for drug trafficking. But the only declaration of war has been on the side of the Panamanians. Q. Casualties. A. I have no information. Q. What's the legal basis here in terms of a declaration of war ... and how had <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> been informed? A. We are basing this on the actions outlined in this statement, which is a pattern of agression in recent days which we think is quite threatening to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. There are some 35,000 Americans there as I recall, roughly 35,000 Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ in a pattern of harassment and threats going back almost a year that involves literally hundreds of cases. I'll try to provide you some details on that later. And on the president's strong feeling that we need to uphold the indictment and to move in this fashion. Q. How has <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> been informed? A.

 Q. Do we know the whereabouts now of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces under strict orders not to shoot him or to injure him in any way? A. I just ca n't comment on the location of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or what we do know about him. That would jeopardize the mission. I just could not offer any comment. Q. What about the question of whether there are strict orders not to shoot him or injure him, to make sure that he is apprehended alive? A. The orders are to apprehend General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. I would not go beyond that. Q. Is President <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> in this country or in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? A. He's in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Q. While the Panamanian Defense Forces perhaps may not measure up to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, nevertheless they're 6,500-strong. They're not necessarily a pushover by any means. Yet you said tonight that there was pretty much assurance on the part of the administration that this mission would be successful. That indicates that there may have been some communications with PDF Forces to either participate or perhaps not resist. Was there any kind of communication with PDF forces beforehand? A. I did not use the word `` assurance.'' I said that we would not undertake such a mission if we did not feel confident that we could carry it out successfully. I'm not aware of any communications directly with the PDF. Q. You said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will be withdrawn as quickly as possible. They will not be withdrawn until we have captured <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? A. We are not willing to specify how long or in what circumstances they would be _ remain there. Q. Who's got operational control? A. Operational control is in the Pentagon. Let me just do one last thing on briefings, that I would expect the next detailed briefing to be operationally oriented and related to logistics and that will come from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>. We do not have a time yet. I would not anticipate it soon, probably later in the morning. I do n't think there's any need for you all to stay here the rest of the night, but you might want to hang around for a while anyway. One final question. Q. You're sending massively troops in to get one man? A. There are four objectives to this. Getting General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out is certainly one of the main ones. It certainly is an objective, yes. Thank you very much.

 Soldiers from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deployment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were mobilized Tuesday night for transport to an unannounced location, while <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, units were on placed on alert, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division -LRB- Light -RRB-, which in some deployments includes artillery and aviation units, were ordered to report to the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base for an `` emergency deployment readiness training exercise,'' <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He said he could not comment on the number of soldiers, their destination or time of departure. Spokesmen for the 82nd Airborne Division and 18th Airborne Corps early Wednesday stood by a statement issued Monday that the exercise at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> was strictly routine. `` Periodically the Army exercises the readiness of selected units,'' said Sgt. 1st Class <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, an 82nd Division spokesman. `` At this time, certain units at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> are undergoing a validation of their readiness and state of training.'' Nineteen buses and a truck loaded with troops arrived at <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, late Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> KCRA-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. But a base spokesman said he could not say where the soldiers came from or where they were going. `` We can not comment on any military operations at this time,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taranto </PERSON>. `` We ca n't comment on anything on the operation.'' <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, was enveloped in heavy fog, and no planes had taken off by late Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> KCRA-TV </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, several thousand soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division were dispatched to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for a prolonged training exercise. The move was interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military might during the burgeoning dispute with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> During last year's mobilization, troops from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> Ord were bused to <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, where they were airlifted to <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to extradict <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls the Panamanian military and the country, since he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been on maximum alert and restricted to base since Panamanian soldiers killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant Saturday.

 Q. Is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the Panamanians is scheduled to occur on Jan. 1 have anything to do with the timing of this operation now? A. I do n't think is has to do with the timing, but it certainly has to do with the substance. We do have a responsibilty under the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> for its safety and security, and we do believe there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty. And that is one of the aspects of our purpose here. Q. Can you give us any details of A, how it's going, B, what the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force that was amassed for this was and how long you think this operation might take? A. I really ca n't answer any of those questions in any great detail. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is committing forces we believe are adequate to the task. It is a major undertaking. There are numbers of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task. But I just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of logistical characterization of the size. The president has been considering this matter for several days. As you all know, he was quite disturbed by the events of last weekend involving the killing of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and the harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife. The president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a plan and the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action. Since then there have been any number of meetings. I will not go into details of when and how they were conducted. But the president has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since Sunday. And there really has not been any question about our willingness or our readiness to proceed since that time. Q. What are the troops' orders with regard to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? Were they ordered to try to take him alive? And if they do, what do you want them to do with him? A. Their orders are to apprhenend Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and our purpose is to return him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution under our laws regarding drug trafficking. Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in the southern district of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and the northern district in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. And we want to bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution under that indictment. Q. Who swore in <LOCATION> Endara </LOCATION>, under what legal authority and where is he now? A. I do n't know who swore him in. The legal authority of course was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the May elections and they are assuming office on that basis.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index regained its early losses today while the dollar edged up against the yen on news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had been sent to seize Panamaniam strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen It started the day's trading at 143.92 yen and ranged between 143.90-144 .25 yen Earlier trading was quiet as market players made small position adjustments ahead of the Christmas holidays. But the dollar edged up later in the afternoon on news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were attacking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered troops into action following several days of tension triggered by the shooting death in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer. `` Japanese market players were waiting to see how the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market reacts to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation tonight,'' the trader said. Participants were also held back by uncertainties over <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s discount rate increase, the trader added `` Although the government yesterday denied a hike any time soon, the market expects a 50 percent chance of a hike by the end of the year,'' the trader said. Local news reports speculated the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> might raise its key lending rate to commercial banks by 0.5 percent to 4.25 percent, but the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> denied the increase would happen any time soon. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank will begin negotiations with the government in an attempt to raise the discount rate soon, citing sources from within the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. An estimated $ 6.3 billion traded hands in spot trading, down from $ 10.8 billion the previous Tuesday. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> regained 72.90 points, or 0.19 percent, ending at 38,512.00. It lost 147.08 points Tuesday on the discount rate rumors. The index, which lost 128.57 points by the end of morning trading, rose back toward the end of the afternoon as speculative investors bought spot issues to collect profits from the spread between the spot and futures markets, said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>, a senior dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market adjusted the index's speed of increase, inspired by the rumor of the discount rate hike yesterday, and the market needed a rest,'' he said. `` Although the market was basically stable and was gradually getting ready for the discount rate to happen, market players were still a bit cautious,'' <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> said. Trading was active with first-section volume estimated at 1 billion shares, up from 900 million Tuesday.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON> dons a blue hospital gown once a week and does for strangers' children what she used to do for her son. She feeds them, talks to them, sings to them and holds them. She is one of a growing number of hospital `` cuddlers,'' who try to provide emotional support and a healing touch to sick children whose parents either can not or will not do so. Nearly three decades ago, <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON> spent as much time as she could at her son's bedside at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> as he lay suffering from rheumatic fever. `` In those days, visiting hours were very restricted, but now parents are allowed to visit day or night _ but some of them do n't,'' <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON> said. `` Some of the parents just ca n't face the severity of a child's -LRB- medical -RRB- problems.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodner </PERSON>, the hospital's director of volunteers, characterized the children as `` medically fragile,'' adding: `` This is their home for several months or even years, and their parents ca n't be here all the time. That's where the cuddlers come in _ to provide an extra pair of hands for the nurses and to provide the children with extra attention and love.'' When <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> began its cuddler program in 1986, hospital officials were looking for `` the grandmother type,'' <PERSON> Kolodner </PERSON> said. The first cuddlers came from a retirement home up the street. `` At first, I said, ` I ca n't do that. I do n't have time,''' said <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbs </PERSON>, a retired nurse who lives at that home. `` But I was so impressed with their orientation program and with the nurses. ... When I left, I was signed up for Tuesday mornings and I've been here every Tuesday morning for the last three years.'' The program has since expanded to include volunteers of all ages. The 60 current cuddlers range from early 20s to 84, <PERSON> Kolodner </PERSON> said. Once Mount <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s cuddler program was established, other area hospitals were swamped with calls asking about similar volunteer programs, said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangledorf </PERSON>, volunteer programs coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and Hopkins Children's Center `` We kept getting requests from people saying, ` Do you have a cuddler program?' so we sat down and said, ` Hey, let's do it,''' <PERSON> Bangledorf </PERSON> said. `` It's been an overwhelming success.'' Other hospitals have started similar programs, in part to deal with the growing number of children born to drug-dependent mothers. Addicted at birth, the children require extra attention and nurturing to calm them. `` Sometimes it will take two hours just to get a baby to drink a few ounces of formula,'' said <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON>. `` The nurses each have to take care of up to four patients. They just do n't have the time to sit for two hours with one baby.'' <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a nurse at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the babies quickly learn to associate their nurses with the sometimes painful treatments they administer. `` But they get to know the cuddlers and you can see their faces light up when a cuddler comes in,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. `` They do n't associate the cuddlers with pain They associate them with loving and playing and cuddling. The cuddlers are a major, major help to the babies.'' `` They know when they see us that we're not anybody who's going to act on them,'' said cuddler <PERSON> Rochelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetman </PERSON>. `` We never hold them while they're getting shots or medicine. ... We're just company for them.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said parents also are grateful for the cuddlers' services. `` They feel better knowing that if they ca n't be here, there is someone who will watch over their children and give them comfort,'' she said. `` People say this is one of the most giving things you can do,'' <PERSON> Gephart </PERSON> said. `` But it's definitely a two-way street. I get so much out of it _ just to see a child who has been unresponsive smile, or to get a child to eat something or to sleep. I get as much out of it as they do.''

<HEAD>New York High Court Throws Out State Harassment Law</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court ruled the state's harassment law unconstitutional, saying speech that may be abusive is still protected by the First Amendment The decision may spark challenges against such laws in other states, attorneys said. Civil rights advocates applauded the decision and said it would prevent police officers from arresting people, especially demonstrators, for using language that could be considered offensive. `` I think it's clear now that you ca n't prosecute someone for cursing someone out on the street,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The case involved a dispute in which a woman called a neighbor a bitch and her son a dog as they passed by her door. The woman, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Raymondville </LOCATION>, also allegedly threatened to `` beat the crap out of'' the woman. <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON>, 19, was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined $ 50. On Tuesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in a 7-0 decision, threw out her conviction. It ruled 5-2 that the law was unconstitutional. The court said the harassment statute `` prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression.'' Judge <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the law needed to be undone `` because its continued existence presents a significant risk of prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech.'' `` Casual conversation may well be abusive and intended to annoy. So, too, may be light-hearted banter or the earnest expression of personal opinion or emotion,'' <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said. `` But unless speech presents a clear and present danger of some serious substantial evil, it may neither be forbidden nor penalized.'' Most states have anti-harassment statutes similar in intent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hellerstein </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist on the First Amendment, said the decision was bound to spur challenges in other states. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has not addressed the issue of whether words _ unless representing a direct threat to safety _ can constitute harassment, <PERSON> Hellerstein </PERSON> said. `` This should be a victory for all of us in protecting liberty,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasdon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, of Tuesday's decision. `` We do n't want to become a society where people get intimidated for being creative or eccentric. `` I guess the standard now is ` fighting words,''' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, spokeswoman for state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who was on the losing end of the case. `` You can not say something that is going to incite someone to an immediate act of violence.'' <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON>'s words drew tears from her neighbor, <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> denied using the language cited in the court case and said that the incident with <PERSON> Lazore </PERSON> stemmed from a feud over a boyfriend. <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> said she was `` relieved'' that the case was over. <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballan </PERSON>, said that while the decision may expand freedom of speech, it could also have another impact. `` There are people who are quite obnoxious and are in the habit of using foul language,'' <PERSON> Ballan </PERSON> said. `` These people are going to feel like they can be as obnoxious as they wish. `` But those are the effects of freedom,'' he said. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> did not return telephone calls. Prosecutors had maintained that <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> stepped over the line of acceptable behavior and that the Constitution does n't apply to abusive language.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops fought Panamanian forces early Wednesday in a bid to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, surrounding his headquarters in a blaze of cannon and machine-gun fire. Opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> proclaimed himself president. `` We have many dead and wounded caused by the attack on the city of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' national radio said. An doctor at the city's <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said there were about 50 dead at the hospital and hundreds wounded. It was unclear how many of the victims were civilians and how many were soldiers. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s whereabouts were not known. However, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, head of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' press office, said on Mexican television that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been warned and was safe in another part of the country. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces -RRB- have destroyed the headquarters because they thought <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was there,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is in another part of the country and is on top of the situation.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were on a mission `` to apprehend <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` We are there to apprehend him and bring him back to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to prosecute him,'' he said. Late Tuesday, mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire echoed across the capital as truckloads of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops headed from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases toward the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces headquarters. `` We're kicking ass tonight,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who stopped reporters along a road about two miles north of the headquarters. The <ORGANIZATION> Britich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday morning that the headquarters was in flames. By 3:45 a.m., the fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> generally had quieted down although there was sporadic gunfire, including the booming of artillery and anti-aircraft fire. The main fighting appeared to take place around the defense headquarters at the western tip of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, in the poor and densely populated neighborhood of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION>. Fighting also was reported near <LOCATION> Paitilla </LOCATION>, a small airstrip along the coast three miles to the east of the headquarters; near the <LOCATION> Marriott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, about six miles east of the headquarters; at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION>, just over 20 miles east of the city; in <LOCATION> Colon </LOCATION>, 50 miles to the north; and near an airport in <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION>, about 200 miles to the west. On Tuesday night, planes and helicopters roared over <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At the Marriot hotel on the capital's eastern edge, armed Panamanians took 12 foreigners hostage. Among them were three reporters, including from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency. They were released unhurt about two hours later. `` A lot of Panamanians have died and we could kill you. Do n't think they wo n't,'' one of the Panamanians told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said there was a report of a fire at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with economic and political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions depressed the economy, but did not budge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and two coup attempts _ most recently in October _ failed to unseat him. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the drug charges and claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cede control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> by the year 2000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been on maximum alert and restricted to base since a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant was killed by Panamanians on Saturday in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an unprovoked incident. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military transports flooded into <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bases in the country. Early Wednesday, government-controlled radio said, `` The general headquarters is being bombarded with heavy artillery ... We are being invaded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in a synchronized plan.'' A man on the 16th floor of a building with a view of the military headquarters in the poor residential neighborhood of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION> said: `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION> is in flames,'' he said. `` You can see a mountain of flares.'' Two ambulances were seen heading for <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base, from the combat zone near Defense Forces headquarters about an hour after the fighting began under a full moon. In a radio broadcast shortly after the fighting broke out at about midnight Tuesday, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> called on Panamanian forces to surrender peacefully and accept his electoral victory in May 7 balloting. Those elections were annulled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Men of honor of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> will have an important role in a democratic <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that will belong to all Panamanians,'' said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, the national radio station, was still under control of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists and broadcast an appeal for all doctors to go to <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tomas </LOCATION> hospital, a hospital on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> about two miles east of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> and near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. It said the headquarters had been `` cruelly bombarded.'' Fighting also was reported east of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, about seven miles east of the headquarters, where a Panamanian cavalry unit is based. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw 24 armored personnel carriers and at least seven trucks carrying <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops head in the direction of Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers surrounding the main Panamanian military installations yelled over megaphones for the Panamanian troops to surrender, residents living near the installations said. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said: `` Panamanian radio is reporting that military planes and helicopters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> are bombing the central part of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... At different points of the Panamanian capital armed clashes have begun between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Panamanian units.'' `` There is all kinds of hell loose out there,'' three young Panamanian soldiers told an AP reporter. Channel 8, television station of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement by unauthorized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel was prohibited. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 12,000 troops based near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The Panamanian Defense Forces, controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, come to about 15,000 men. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also has armed citizen `` Dignity Battalions'' of his loyalists. Further aggravating tensions after Saturday night's shooting of the American, another <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer wounded a Panamanian policeman because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon, according to Southern Command. On Tuesday evening, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter and a <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> reporter were detained for about an hour by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police when they tried to enter <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> air base to determine whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were landing. The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the two reporters were released without incident. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> attack was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military invasion of another nation since Oct. 25, 1983, when a U.S.-led force invaded <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, southernmost of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Windward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isles </ORGANIZATION>, six days after Marxist Prime Minister <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was executed following a coup by radical army officers. More than than 6,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers participated in the assault, which cost the lives of 19 Americans, 42 Cubans building an airport on the island and 24 Grenadian civilians. All <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have left the island.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made up his mind Sunday to launch the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, barely 24 hours after the slaying of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer outside <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the White House said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials kept their plans secret until Tuesday evening when news organizations began reporting heavy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military flights into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 12,000 troops based to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Even as the Pentagon was preparing the effort to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and allow Panamanian opposition leaders to take over the government, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went as planned Tuesday evening to a White House Christmas party for 300 friends, administration officials, White House staff and reporters. The president maintained silence Sunday when asked for his reaction to the killing of the unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant, who was trying to escape a Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> checkpoint after a wrong turn brought him and three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers close to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in an early morning briefing today announcing the move against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has been considering this matter for several days.'' He said the president `` was quite disturbed'' by the killing of the Marine officer and harassment of a naval officer and his wife by Panamanian soldiers at the same checkpoint. `` The president reviewed this issue with his national security advisers on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a plan and the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He added that there had been `` any number of meetings'' since Sunday, but emphasized, `` there really has not been any question about our willingness or our readiness to proceed since that time.'' The White House on Sunday deplored the killing of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and said the incident was a `` consequence'' of the outlaw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime, imposed on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> against `` the will of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people'' who voted in May to elect opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> to the presidency. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military commander and de facto ruler, nullified those elections. On Friday a legislature of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> cronies declared the country in a state of war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and named <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> its `` maximum'' leader. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an interview Monday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other wire services, expressed `` enormous frustration ... that the democratic system that was voted on in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was totally put down by force.'' He called the killing of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> `` an enormous outrage,'' and pointedly refused to rule out a military response. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no public events on his schedule Tuesday except the Christmas party, where he and wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> gaily posed with each guest for pictures in front of an enormous tree, decorated with dolls from children's stories and fables. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed to hear an Army chorus sing carols in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, hoisting up 3-year-old granddaughter <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON> in his arms for a better view and extending a hearty handshake to former White House press secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt against former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, military public information officers also sought not to tip their hand. Most left their offices at the regular quitting time Tuesday evening. National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, his deputy <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> all put in brief appearances at the Christmas party Tuesday night before shuttling back to their offices to wait for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed in the Oval Office until 4:05 a.m. EST, when he retired to his personal residence for a brief sleep before a 7 a.m. address to the nation from the Oval Office.

Troops from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> were airlifted to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who praised President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the decision to send to the Central American country. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is `` up to his eyeballs in the drug traffic,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who nullified his country's May elections, was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges in February 1988. The senator's comments followed the mobilization Tuesday night of an undetermined number of soliders from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, about 80 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and their transfer, apparently to <ORGANIZATION> Travis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>. Soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division -LRB- Light -RRB-, which in some deployments includes artillery and aviation units, were ordered to report to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION> for an `` emergency deployment readiness training exercise,'' some time Monday, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, public affairs officers for the Army. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, however, said that as a matter of policy, he could not comment on the number mobilized, their destination or their time of departure. By early today, military convoys were seen heading north on Interstate 680 toward <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, according to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol. Nineteen buses and a truck loaded with soldiers arrived at <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> late Tuesday, according KCRA-TV in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. More buses and trucks were reported going into the base about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But a base spokesman said he could not say where the soliders came from or where they were going. `` We can not comment on any military operations at this time,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Taranto </PERSON>. `` We ca n't comment on anything on the operation.'' <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> was enveloped in heavy fog, making flights difficult. Earlier Tuesday, C-141 planes were seen in the air around <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 82nd Airborne division. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> spokesmen would say only that <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units there were participating in a routine `` emergency deployment readiness exercise.''

 Redoubt Volcano's eruption subsided, allowing scientists to get their closest look yet, and holiday travelers got off the ground as fears eased that volcanic ash would clog jet engines. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volcano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> said no more ash reached <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> after a plume consisting mostly of gas gushed from the volcano early Tuesday. `` The plume appears to be moving primarily toward the southwest and west,'' observatory geologist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> said. He said the volcano, about 115 miles from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, sent forth little ash. Redoubt erupted Thursday after 23 years. The fallout brought <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> air traffic to a virtual halt Saturday as the hectic Christmas travel season opened. Geologists made a research flight over Redoubt on Tuesday, but clouds obscured the top of the 10,197-foot volcano, and observations were limited, <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> said. He said earthquake activity beneath the volcano appeared to slacken early in the afternoon. `` It's too early to tell whether this indicates a significant change in the volcano's behavior, or whether it's just a short-term fluctuation,'' <PERSON> Brantley </PERSON> said. The main carrier serving the Anchorage-Seattle route resumed regular operations Tuesday and added flights to deal with a backlog of about 1,200 passengers in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` We're moving them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cancelmi </PERSON> said. `` We are also moving post office mail, and we've got additional freighters scheduled. It's going pretty well.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aiport </ORGANIZATION>, the operations office said crowds awaiting flights thinned as airlines began flying, although some interstate carriers with relatively light <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> schedules did not resume service. Carriers serving <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> points from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> were back in the sky, but some international lines continued to divert flights to airports elsewhere, airport officials said. About 70 of 240 passengers with tickets for <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 25 remained in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> on Tuesday for what they said were safety reasons, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION>'s customer relations manager in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The others left aboard a Korea-bound flight early in the day. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 operated by <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fell about two miles after it passed through volcanic ash and lost power to all four engines. The engines were restarted and the plane made an emergency landing at the <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> passengers who stayed behind would be put aboard the next available plane to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, `` but we do n't know when that will be at this point. It depends on the climatic conditions.'' Aside from passengers, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> continued to charter aircraft to haul the usual upsurge in holiday mail between <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. By Tuesday morning, 60,000 pounds of mail waited to be flown from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, some of it left from Monday and the rest deposited overnight at the airport's 24-hour post office, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. About 90,000 pounds awaited transportation north from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Officials expected the backlogs to be cleared up by today.

 The four children of <LOCATION> Ecclesia </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are returning to their father's care for the first time since their 8-year-old sister was beaten to death by four of his followers. `` I want them home in time for Christmas,'' Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said in setting today as a deadline for the children to be released to their parents. `` It will be good to get my children back,'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> told reporters at the conclusion of the four-day custody hearing. A <ORGANIZATION> Clackamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge agreed last month to allow custodial visits to resume between <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, his wife and their surviving children. The <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> children, ages 5 to 11, have been in state care since the sensational child abuse case erupted. Thirty-three Ecclesia children remain in foster homes, according to the state Children's Services Division. On Oct. 14, 1988, the body of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was taken to a rural fire station by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a religious and athletic training group founded by <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> in the Watts section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The next day, state juvenile authorities were dispatched to <LOCATION> Ecclesia </LOCATION>'s farmhouse east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, where they found 55 hungry, abused children crammed into four bedrooms. The youngsters were loaded onto buses and turned over to the Children's Services Division. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at the time of the beating, defended the four Ecclesia staff members charged with first-degree manslaughter. He denied that he was a cult leader and that the Ecclesia children had been mistreated. But during the trial, four of the children testified how they had witnessed young <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s punishment for taking food from another child's plate. They said they were forced to watch and count the blows _ more than 800. In May, three men and a woman were convicted in the killing, and they were sentenced to maximum 20-year prison terms in June. Later, a fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment for beating other children. By that time, the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had disbanded and <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who once defended his group on <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>'s television show, had begun to fade from the public eye On the anniversary of the beating death, 40 of the children remained in foster homes. Children's Services Division officials said their parents had refused to admit past abuses or to promise they would be safe from abuse. The following week there was a turning point in the case, when <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> appeared at a custody hearing for his 3-year-old nephew. For the first time, he acknowledged that Ecclesia members had been culpable in his daughter's death. The response was immediate from <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who ruled the boy could be returned to his parents by year's end. The following month, <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> and his wife returned to court to request custody of their own children. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> broke into tears while defending his assertion that adult Ecclesia members put group concerns ahead of the children's needs <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> he was moved by his show of emotion. `` Maybe it's says something that has n't been said before,'' said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. `` Everyone is sorry it happened. It's now history. We must look ahead.'' On Nov. 16, the Broussards' custody request was granted. The parents were given a list of 11 conditions to meet, among them that corporal punishment would be forbidden and that the children must attend public schools and undergo regular mental health counseling. State Children's Services Division spokesman <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that the Broussards were give the final go-ahead on Dec. 13, but he declined to reveal further details of the family's plans.

 More people than usual are expected to hit the nation's transportation routes during the Christmas weekend, and safety officials are urging motorists to be extra careful. Some 35.8 million people _ the highest number in five years _ planned to travel at least 100 miles away from home during the holiday weekend, according to a national survey. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> surveyed 1,500 nationwide for the <ORGANIZATION> AAA-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. About 5.2 million people planned to travel by car, the survey found. The holiday officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 25. With so many motorists on the highways, between 320 and 420 people could be killed in car accidents, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said. Another 15,000 to 19,000 people could suffer disabling injuries, the council said. During the Christmas holiday last year, 386 people died in car accidents and about 17,900 were injured. Travelers should gas up their cars early because about two-thirds of the nation's gas stations will be closed on Christmas, <ORGANIZATION> AAA-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said.

<DATELINE>MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The woman who won control of seven frozen human embryos in an unprecedented custody dispute has remarried, and lawyers for her ex-husband say that could help them when the case is appealed. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has been living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since the August divorce trial, married <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> last week. Attorneys <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said the remarriage could bolster their case of <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> before the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The lawyers said the remarriage renders moot two of Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' contentions during the trial: that the seven embryos created by her and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> fertility clinic last year might represent her last chance to become pregnant and that fertilization clinics would not take her as a client if she were single `` My client always maintained this was n't her last chance,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. `` If the court of appeals adopts the reasoning we'll ask them to, to balance the interests of the two adults, then I think the remarriage would affect the balance. That was not, however, the reasoning adopted by the trial judge, <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Young ruled that the embryos are essentially unborn human beings with rights of their own, and decided the case based on what he felt was best for the embryos. `` Based on that ruling, this does n't affect his reasoning at all,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. But, she said she believes Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' remarriage `` makes a psychological difference to the court.'' She said it will be the spring before the appeals court hears the case.

 <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Wampanoag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> over a prime beach-front property that the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> say contain the graves of a chief and his wife may soon be resolved, lawyers for both sides say. Wampanoag lore holds that Chief <PERSON> Moshup </PERSON> and his wife, Squant, are buried on the disputed <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard land. <LOCATION> Moshup </LOCATION>, according to the oral tradition, threw his children into the sea when he saw the white man approaching. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> bought a 17 percent interest in the <LOCATION> Gay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION> beach property in 1980 from a Wampanoag family that has owned the property since the state surveyed and divided up Gay Head in 1870. A hearing expected to settle the matter of the 264-foot stretch of coastal property was set for Feb. 2, <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There have been negotiations but we're not quite there yet,'' he said. The beach is held in undivided interest by more than 25 individuals, including Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>. But since she purchased her part of the beach, the widow of President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has fought the matter in court. Her private 380-acre retreat surrounds the beach. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulla </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney and Gay Head resident representing the Indians, said a settlement was close. He declined to discuss the terms. The Wampanoag are descendants of the island's first settlers. Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> bought the acreage for her home in the mid-1970s and since then has brought a series of legal actions in an attempt to clear the title on the adjoining land. In turn, the <LOCATION> Wampanoag </LOCATION> sued Mrs. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> to retain access to the property.

<TEXT>
 Four top <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials are among 11 people under indictment in a broad corruption probe in the gambling resort, but the grand jury was silent on the mayor, who had been arrested in the case. `` It's an active, ongoing investigation,'' the state attorney general's spokesman, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Florentz </PERSON>, said Tuesday. `` It does not conclude with today's indictments. The charges at this time have not been dropped.'' <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> had no comment, said <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Norrell-Nance </PERSON>, an aide. `` City government can continue to march,'' said business administrator <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, who runs the resort's everyday affairs. Among those indicted Tuesday were <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Collette </PERSON>, Councilman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Zoning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kaleem </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabazz </PERSON>, who are all accused of accepting bribes to use their positions to obtain zoning breaks and other benefits for private businesses. Another councilman, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsatti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was charged with participating in the conspiracy. A state police sting hit the top echelon of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s government with arrests and corruption charges on July 27 Besides the 11 indicted, <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> and two others were arrested in the sweep that culminated an eight-month investigation. <PERSON> Usry </PERSON>, 67, was led away from his home by police in a roundup of suspects. Authorities said $ 6,000 in cash was found in his home, but the mayor's attorney said the money was a contribution from a businessman that <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> was to relay to a children's charity. The arrest was an embarrassment to state Republicans, including Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who had helped put <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> in office and make him one of the most prominent black Republican officials in the nation. Including <PERSON> Usry </PERSON> _ who was elected as a reformer _ four of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s last seven mayors have been arrested. The indictment also named <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, former director of the city's housing authority; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, a former jockey and partner in a liquor store; <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosee </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> and a former councilman; and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. State Police Superintendent Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> is charged with accepting a $ 1,000 bribe in May by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, who was cooperating as an undercover agent for the state police. Authorities said the investigation began when <PERSON> Black </PERSON> approached them with reports that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had solicited a bribe from him. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> became a key source for investigators, but his account of the complex of alleged bribes and influence was questioned by one suspect Tuesday. `` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> has altered the facts and corrupted the truth beyond recognition,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` The Salem witch hunts prove that in the end, truth will win out.'' Authorities suspect <PERSON> Collette </PERSON> accepted the bribe in exchange for influencing a zoning variance that would enable <PERSON> Black </PERSON> to operate a car wash. <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> was accused in the indictment of taking a $ 7,500 cash bribe from Black to obtain a zoning variance for a gas station <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> were also charged with soliciting and accepting $ 3,500 in bribes from Black for influencing <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Am </PERSON> to give <PERSON> Black </PERSON> a gift shop concession at <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. All 11 defendants will be arraigned in January in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>.

 Ice clogged more than 200 miles of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and people across the country bundled up today against an arctic blast that dropped temperatures to record lows from the Plains to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` You'd have to take extra care if you're going to be out for any length of time,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Merzlock </PERSON>, a weather service forecaster in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's certainly a danger.'' Since Friday, at least 40 deaths have been blamed on the weather, including traffic deaths on slippery roads and hypothermia. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, high temperatures today were expected to be no more than 15 below to 25 below, with winds of 15 to 25 mph producing wind chills of 55 below to 80 below, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is way below normal for December,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, a weather service meteorologist at <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, which recorded Tuesday's coldest reading for the Lower 48 at 35 below `` It will be the worst cold we've had this season.'' A 203-mile stretch of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was closed to barge traffic by ice and low water, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. About 60 percent of the 195 miles of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, to the Gavins Point Dam was frozen Tuesday, forming ice jams that reduced the amount of water flowing downstream to towns and power plants. The river level was within one foot of the level at which some power plants would be unable to operate because their water intake systems would no longer work, said <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Worm </PERSON>, chief of the reservoir regulation section of the <LOCATION> Corps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. About 300,000 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> customers in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> soon may have to ration water if the cold weather keeps freezing the river and causing ice to form on water intake valves, officials said. In such brutal weather conditions, officials advised people going outside to dress with extra layers of clothing and to carry emergency survival kits when traveling. Farmers and ranchers also were warned to take precautions to protect their animals from the bitter cold. In Grand Forks, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, the local humane society put to sleep 40 animals on Monday to make room for a high number of animals brought in because of the bitter cold, said the society's executive director, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Toay </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> outreach centers pleaded for donations of warm clothes to help the needy stave off the unusual cold. The average mean temperature in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for the first 18 days of December was 14.1 degrees, compared to the month's norm of 23.5 degrees. `` There are people coming in here with just tennis shoes on their feet. It's cold, so cold out,'' said <PERSON> Floria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s Outreach in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Ice on roads was blamed for accidents around metropolitan <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and police blocked off several interstate highway ramps that were littered with cars and trucks unable to cross slick spots. Record low temperatures for the date Tuesday included 8 at <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; 6 at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; 10 at <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; 26 below zero at <LOCATION> Dickinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; 6 below at <ORGANIZATION> Elkins </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; 19 below at <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, Neb; 5 at <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; 20 below at <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.; 24 below at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>.; 7 below at <LOCATION> Wheat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; and 3 below at <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 Passengers said it felt `` like a nightmare'' when a collision between a truck hauling chocolate syrup and the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train in which they were riding killed three people and injured 55. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, a passenger from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said Tuesday's crash `` felt like somebody had dead-stopped us. Then we hit three times. ... My head was clobbered each time.'' `` I was collecting tickets and then all hell broke loose,'' said conductor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` I wound up flying into the next car.'' <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> said Tuesday that investigators were trying to determine the accident's cause, including the dense fog which was blamed for a couple of multi-car pileups in the region. The crash killed the truck driver and two train crewmen. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said the truck driver seemed to be responsible for the crash. `` Evidently the vehicle ignored the lights and went right in front of train,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said. But Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who toured the scene, said the three people killed in the crash may be the only ones who really know what happened. The 70-mph speed of the train was within the limit for the area, according to federal transportation officials. People aboard the train, which carried at least 142 including five <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> crew members, described nightmarish conditions during the crash and its aftermath. No one said they had seen the truck or warning devices at the crossing before the collision. `` It was like a nightmare,'' said passenger <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>. `` I was sitting there reading the paper and then crash, fire. I was thrown to the floor. Seats crumpled ahead and behind me. Everybody was screaming and yelling. One woman was yelling for her baby.'' Several passengers said the train and ground were so covered with chocolate from the truck that they slipped as they tried to leave the train. `` It hit hard, harder than anything I've ever felt,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who was in third of five passenger cars behind the engine. `` I was thrown forward. `` I was looking out the window and I could see the flames -LRB- of the burning truck and train engine wreckage -RRB- coming toward us... I just braced myself and watched it, but it stopped, thank God.'' The 34-year-old <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> woman said she was not going on to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to get on another train,'' she said. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office identified the dead truck driver as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskell </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>. The other two victims were identified only as the train's engineer and fireman, pending notification of relatives. Of the 55 injured, 24 seriously injured people were taken by ambulance to hospitals, <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> said. Buses took 31 others to various medical facilities for examination and treatment of minor injuries. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> said 87 uninjured people were taken by bus to the <LOCATION> Riverbank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amtrak </LOCATION> station, about 20 miles south of the crash site. The train was southbound from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> route when the crash occurred at 9:38 a.m., about nine minutes after leaving the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> station The <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> locomotive overturned and burst into flames, which took more than an hour to extinguish. The truck was demolished, broken into hundreds of small pieces, and carried 300 feet down the tracks by the train's engine. The truck's load of chocolate syrup coated two of the train's five passenger cars. The investigation into the cause of the crash by transportation officials continued Tuesday night as <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> crews pulled luggage from the wreckage. Cleanup and repair of 900 feet of damaged track was expected to take several days.

<TEXT>
 Is Shylock, the infamous moneylender of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>,'' victim or villain? <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> opts for mild-mannered victim in <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s straightforward, ungimmicky production of the play which opened Tuesday at Broadway's 46th Street Theater <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was the reason this problematic comedy was a hot ticket in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last summer and why it was brought to Broadway for what looks like a sold-out 12-week run. The star's fans wo n't be disappointed, but his almost genial approach robs the play of much of its emotional depth and Shylock of his complexity. Dressed in a flowing robe, his long hair pulled back tightly under a skullcap, the bearded <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> jokes and grins in a manner that would not be out of place in the current <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> revival of <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chayefsky </PERSON>'s `` The Tenth Man.'' His voice, flavored with an appropriate Jewish accent, is strong and projects well. Shylock's impassioned speech defending his Jewishness is delivered quietly with a somber dignity that is <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s best moment in the play. His Shylock is an accommodating man, especially when he agrees to lend money to <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> in exchange for a pound of flesh if the borrower defaults. Shylock meekly suffers humiliation. If revenge is on his mind, he does n't let anyone know, at least until he thinks he can win. Hall clearly sees Shylock as a survivor of persecution in a society where antisemitism was rampant. The Venetian Christians are the real villains of the piece, louts who spit in the Jew's face, steal his daughter and even force him to become a Christian before the final curtain. If Shylock's plight is heavily underlined in <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production, his tragedy is never fully explored or realized by the star. The loss of his daughter to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, a Christian, and even the forfeiture of his own faith do n't seem like the devastating blows they should be. There's no sense of tragedy when the defeated Shylock walks out of the courtroom to the jeers and harassment of the crowd. At the same time, his villainy during the famous courtroom scene seems unemotional, almost perfunctory. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> earns laughs rather than hisses when he sharpens his knife to collect the pound of flesh, and cheers on the judge when he appears to be winning his case. Hall has better success with the lighter, more romantic aspects of the play. The scenes in which the three suitors must pick the right casket if they are to win the fair <PERSON> Portia </PERSON> are staged as pageants, complete with a stage full of extras, strange music, exotic costumes. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, in the play's real star role, is a radiant <PERSON> Portia </PERSON>, witty as well as intelligent, and with a charming competitiveness that would endear her to the most ardent feminist. Her interpretation of the `` quality of mercy'' speech _ one of the best known in the Shakespeare _ is a revelation and the heart of the play. She speaks these lines as if she's giving a bit of sensible advice rather than commanding the stage for a star turn. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> is a sober-sided but not morose <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, the merchant whose life is nearly lost for friendship. Most of the younger performers in the large cast perfectly capture the gaiety of what are some of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s best romantic scenes. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> is properly impassioned as the lovestruck <PERSON> Bassanio </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Siberry </PERSON> is a terrific Gratiano, turning the usually long-winded boor into a funny, well-meaning best friend. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>'s setting is impressively adaptable, a series of reddish-brown pillars that can turn quickly from a Venetian street scene to idyllic Belmont to the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>'s palace by the dropping of a curtain or the unfurling of a long red carpet. `` The Merchant of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>'' makes a lot of modern audiences uncomfortable with its episodes of virulent prejudice, alternating with a love story that seems almost like a fairy tale. This production captures the lighter, sunnier hues of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s romance, but the darker shadows of the play elude both <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> The play opened to general praise from Broadway critics for <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production, and also for <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. All said <PERSON> James </PERSON> gives the best performance. <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> `` triumphed _ a deliberately modest triumph, but his own.'' He also praised <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production for being `` refreshingly simple,'' making <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> a pleasure <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Winer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> questioned <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production, saying it was difficult to understand the balance between tragedy and comedy. But she said <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was `` the best thing'' about the play. The Daily News' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> was the only critic to flatly criticize <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. He said if <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> were an unknown actor, he would not have won the part. He also faulted <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s production, calling it abrasive. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the production is unexpected because romance and comedy are restored, making it highly watchable. He said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s Shylock does not dominate as would be normal in the play, but <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s performance is `` a character actor's polished gem.''

For the next 4 -LCB- hours, the men held us hostage, told us about their comrades who had already fallen in the battle and threatened to kill us. `` A lot of Panamanians have died, and we can kill you,'' one of them told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruson </PERSON>. `` Do n't think we wo n't. I had just checked into the hotel and come down to the sunken terrace when I saw armed men running in a crouched position by the swimming pool. Right about the same time I heard gunfire. It was about midnight, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assault had started. I made for the hotel's main building with several other reporters when a man with an assault rifle appeared and said, ` Hit the floor.' He herded us over into the lobby, which was full of people. The gunmen took peoples' passports, they searched my bag. About a dozen of the men took charge of me and 11 other foreigners, including two other correspondents. I never saw more than 20 armed men in the hotel. They told us they had surrounded the building. ` We're being invaded, so we're taking hostages,' the man who appeared to be their leader said. They did not threaten me personally, but they made it clear that they could kill us all. There were about eight Americans in our group. <PERSON> Gruson </PERSON> and I tried to persuade the men to let us call our offices to tell the story of the invasion. We saw them herding the guests and staff into the grand ballroom. A man in a silk bathrobe kept saying to the captors, `` I'm Chilean! I'm Chilean!'' The armed men eventually let me retrieve my bag and notebook _ my money had been taken _ and they let me remain in the lobby. <PERSON> Gruson </PERSON> went upstairs where he said he was threatened by one of the gunmen, who kept pointing his assault rifle at him. At one point, the gunman put the muzzle of his weapon against <PERSON> Gruson </PERSON>'s mouth, he told me later About 1:45 a.m., a few other hostages and I were herded into a red van at gunpoint and driven to a private home in the wealthy neighborhood where the Panmanian leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, lives. We were ordered into the service area off the kitchen and made to sit on the floor. Our captors let us have water and smoke cigarettes. We were there until 4 a.m. I kept hearing aircraft passing low overhead, sporadic gunfire from automatic weapons. Things were tapering off. Between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m., the phone rang three times. More hostage-takers showed up. Then a man who appeared to be their leader said, `` We're going to let you go. We do n't want to kill you. Tell the truth about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. We're not killers.'' `` There are hundreds of dead in the Central Barracks.'' The men seemed very sad. One was crying. They put us back into a van and let us out in the street. I raced to a private home and called the AP office.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE GOVERNMENT _ The government had been nominally headed by provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who took office Sept. 1. But the real leader was <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who last week assumed the title of head of state. He inherited command of the military from Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who seized power in 1968 and died in a plane crash in 1981. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February 1988. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has continued to recognize <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, imposed economic sanctions on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power.

<TEXT>
 THE CANAL _ The 51-mile <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, connecting the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans, was built by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1904 to 1914 on territory leased from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Treaties signed by then-President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> in 1977 transfer control of the canal and its defense to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE ECONOMY _ <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was a leading international financial center with about 120 banks holding an estimated $ 30 billion in assets. But a flight of capital caused by the political struggle over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule has sharply reduced assets to about $ 8 billion, according to government figures. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have complained that secret bank accounts the country offered as business enticements helped make <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a haven for illegally laundered drug money. Opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled to 23 percent. The country's main crops are bananas, pineapples, cocoa, corn, coconuts and sugar. The official currency is the dollar, but it is called the balboa.

<HEAD>Man Kills Self, Trying to Donate Heart to Ill Brother; Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMARAC, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who felt he was a failure committed suicide outside a hospital in an effort to save a brother with heart disease. But the body was found too late, and his heart could not be used for a transplant. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 46, drove his van Monday evening to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION> and parked outside the emergency room, authorities said Tuesday. Then he put a gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger. Ten minutes passed before a nurse on her way home noticed <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> slumped over the steering wheel. An emergency medical crew administered heart massage, but he died less than an hour later. Police found suicide notes in the van in which <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> complained of `` too many downs and no ups for me on this roller coaster ride of life.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> wrote that he wanted his heart donated to his 56-year-old brother, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who has been on a waiting list for a heart transplant for nearly three years. `` His main purpose for -LRB- committing suicide -RRB- at the hospital was to make his heart available for his brother,'' said <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON>'s Detective <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> `` Unfortunately, he failed.'' `` It made me feel like someone special,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Belvedere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` He thought of me in his last thoughts. He wanted somebody benefiting from his death. `` I love my brother,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> added, sobbing. `` I'm going to miss him.'' The elder <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who was diagnosed as having cardiomyopathy, which causes an enlarged heart, and other relatives said they recognized <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> did not succeed in life as he might have wished, but they said they had no idea he might be suicidal. `` I think he probably was capable of doing anything he wanted to do. If he'd only gone and done it,'' said <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 58, who lives in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, said of his younger brother. Instead, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> worked in lounges and sold bar supplies. He was unemployed in recent months. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION> about eight years ago to help a sister after her husband died of a heart attack, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> said. But three weeks ago, she asked her brother to move out, according to <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>. `` She thought it was time for him to stand on his own two feet,'' the detective said. Since then, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> had lived in his van, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said. On Sunday, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> recorded a tape. An <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> fan who named his daughter <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, same as the singer's daughter, he sang `` I'll be Home for Christmas,'' and in two letters asked that the song be played at his funeral. To his daughter, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> wrote: `` I'm so sorry it had to come to this Honey, but lately there's been too many downs and no ups for me on this roller coaster ride of life! `` I'm tired of everyone saying how much talent I've got. Uncle <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s got everything to live for! And if they find out he can use it and Uncle <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> wants it, I'm going to be his donor <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>! I figure I could do more good for him than myself!''

<HEAD>Buchwald Says His Movie Idea `Stolen, Raped' by Studio</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Art <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> amused court spectators with his wry humor but said there was nothing funny about what he called <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>' theft of his idea for the film `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` It's very hard for a humorist to be taken seriously in something like this,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist testified Tuesday in his $ 5 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>. `` I feel this is a very serious matter. I feel my property has been stolen, raped, whatever you want to call it.'' Paramount contends there are no similarities between <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s idea and the hit movie starring <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> The trial was to continue today. Asked by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> if the studio's chairman, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, is a good friend of <LOCATION> Buchwald </LOCATION>, the humorist said, `` He used to be. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not seem to know about the breach-of-contract suit until the two encountered each other at a party last year. `` The next thing I know a bottle of <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perignon </PERSON> arrives at my desk with a copy of a recording called ` Sue Me,''' <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> recalled. `` I sent him back a note that said, ` Anyone who sends a bottle of <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perignon </PERSON> is guilty.''' <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> said Paramount optioned his story, `` It's a Crude, Crude World'' in 1982, then changed its title to `` King for a Day'' and spent nearly $ 500,000 trying to develop it as a movie for <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. Paramount abruptly dropped its option in 1985 and <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> and his co-plaintiff, producer <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernheim </PERSON>, took the idea to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> on Tuesday, his second day of testimony in the non-jury trial. But <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> dropped the idea in 1987 when word spread that Paramount was producing a similar story. <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> said he has decided against calling <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> as a witness in the case because of the `` circus atmosphere'' that accompanied the appearance Monday of late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> testified that he and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> conceived the idea for `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' in which <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> also starred. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> testified likewise in a deposition. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s 2 -LCB- - page script idea and `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' were about an <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> prince who comes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, lives in the ghetto, falls in love and takes a bride back to his country

<TEXT>
 For the second time in seven months, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> has been declared president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and once again it comes amid violent clashes between his supporters and those who back Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a portly, affable lawyer and former law professor, was sworn in as president today after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, in a bid to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, launched an assault on the country. His opposition activities date back more than two decades, to when he served in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s grand old man of the opposition. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1988 in self-imposed exile. He used to speak, amost dreamily, of the day when <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> would return `` as a sign of providence'' to lead the country. In May, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> himself was chosen to lead the country in a presidential election. Exit polls showed <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice-presidential candidates with an edge of about 3-1, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified the results, ignoring the outcry at home and abroad. Three days after the vote, men wearing T-shirts of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` Dignity Battalions'' battered <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his two vice-presidential candidates in a bloody street scene captured by foreign cameras <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed, recovering from the attack. `` They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied guayabera, a short - sleeved, smock-type shirt favored by many Latins He staged a hunger strike to press <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to accept his victory and urged his supporters not to accept the military man as their leader. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a veteran member of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, ran very much in the shadow of <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> lost control of the party in December to <PERSON> Hildebrando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicosia </PERSON>, who ran as a third-party candidate in May and finished third. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> adopted <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, and the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> ran him for president. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> served twice in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and was <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days as president <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> went into hiding, was jailed for a time and eventually fled to exile. When <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> reorganized his party as the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panamanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> helped. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who studied at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lacked <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' charisma and spent most of his time behind the scenes of the opposition's seemingly endless attempts to replace the de facto military power that began its iron-fisted rule 21 years ago. In a pre-election interview he put faith in the hope that the democratic process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would prevail, electoral fraud or not. He said if he won <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be given a chance to leave gracefully and be fired if he refused. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hired and fired presidents pretty much at will after taking over the military in 1983. His last victim was <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the general was indicted on drug charges last year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Even so, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he trusted the democratic process. `` Remember <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in very different circumstances,'' he said. `` He was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984. That's the price you pay for not being a democratically elected person. You are subject to the decisions of the military.'' He and his wife, <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>, have one daughter, also named <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>, outlining the policies of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s new government, said today there would be no compromises in tackling seccessionist campaigns by Sikh and Moslem militants. In a speech prepared by Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s government, <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> told a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that new efforts must be made to halt religious strife and corruption. The president, whose post is largely ceremonial, also said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> would retain friendly ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, seek to solve a border dispute with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and strengthen economic ties with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose centrist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> took office after forging a coalition with Hindu right-wingers and secular communists, listened attentively in the front row of the Central Hall of Parliament. <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, whose five-year tenure as prime minister ended in the November election debacle for his <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, took notes. <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>, noting that voters had given `` a clear verdict in favor of change,'' said the new government would strive to meet the challenges ahead. `` The <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> problem has defied solution so far,'' he said, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> separatist movement that has claimed more than 7,000 lives in the past six years and triggered the 1984 assassination of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. `` There will be no compromise with separatism and no yielding to extremists, but there is admittedly a compelling need for a national endeavor to resolve the problem,'' the white-haired president said. He said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s government would broaden the discussions it has already initiated on finding a political solution for <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s most prosperous farming state. The nationally televised, 15-minute speech set out a course of action for government but gave few specifics. It was delivered in the same Parliament hall where <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s independence was proclaimed at midnight on Aug. 14, 1947. Turning to <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, where pro-Pakistan Moslems seek to secede from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> vowed: `` There will be no compromise on the country's unity, sovereignty and integrity.'' The 2-week-old government of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> has already had its first serious challenge from <LOCATION> Kashmiri </LOCATION> militants. On Dec. 8, militants kidnapped the daughter of Home Minister <PERSON> Mufti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayeed </PERSON>, also a Kashmiri Moslem. The young woman, a hospital intern, was released unharmed after six days when the government freed five Moslem extremists. In a reference to Hindu-Moslem riots that claimed more than 300 lives this fall in other states, the president said: `` Violence has no place in the land of <PERSON> Mahatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, the apostle of non-violence.'' He was referring to Indian independence leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> said that under <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose chief campaign pledge was to eradicate government corruption, legislation would be introduced to appoint an ombudsman, or watchdog, whose jurisdiction would include the prime minister.

 Waves of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops attacked <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military bases early today in an all-out bid to capture Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and break his tenacious hold on power. Mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire crackled across the capital, and one hospital reported 50 dead and hundreds wounded. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was not captured and his bodyguard said he was in hiding, directing his forces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were backed by warplanes and armored personnel carriers and fighting raged into the mid-morning before Panamanian resistance was quelled. By dawn, a pall of smoke lit by the flames of dying fires covered the capital. Only sporadic firing could be heard, but residents were warned to stay indoors and away from the fighting. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that nine Americans had been killed in action, 39 were wounded and one was missing. Opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, winner of May elections the Noriega-controlled government nullified, was sworn in as president and given immediate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a nationwide broadcast in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in hiding and `` the action is not over yet.'' `` Tragically, some Americans have lost their lives in defense of their fellow citizens, in defense of democray,'' he said. `` We also regret and mourn the loss of innocent Panamanians.'' The invasion by American troops is the violent climax of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s long battle with the cagey military leader, who had set up a succession of puppet presidents while running a military empire that purportedly trafficked in Colombian cocaine. The bellicose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> survived two coup attempts, a losing election, and tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions while brashly flouting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s futile attempts to break his grip on power. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, where about 30 ships cross the isthmus daily, was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting, according to <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrellon </PERSON>. He said landslides had caused the only previous canal closings. The capital's sky was bright with the light of gunfire for hours; blacked-out planes and helicopters roared overhead under a full moon. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assault began about midnight as forces dispatched from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases attacked <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military headquarters, which witnesses in nearby apartments said was in flames at 12:40 a.m. and virtually destroyed by 2 a.m. American troops from bases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were airlifted in on Tuesday to augment the 12,000 soldiers based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said another 9,500 troops from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases were sent to augment the force. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` reckless'' behavior had `` created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> base <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the capital. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s main bodyguard, Lt. <PERSON> Asuncion </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, spoke on the national radio network after dawn to say that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` well and in a safe place.'' `` Do n't anyone give up your positions. In the provinces, prepare to resist. The attacks are going to continue when they find we are not going to cede,'' he said. <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, who is well-known as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s prime bodyguard and is with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> whenever the general is seen in public, then gave a series of messages using code names and instructions. The codes mentioned names like `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>,'' or said, `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, take the man to the hangar and <PERSON> Yeyo </PERSON>.'' Others were more comprehensible. One was a reference to the so-called civilian Dignity Battalions of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists. `` Dignity Battalions operate in small operations during the day or look for positions and mix with the people who support you and at night move and act against the enemy positions in the periphery of the city,'' ran one. Meanwhile, casualty reports were climbing. Dr. <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said wounded had been coming in all night and the number increased with daybreak. `` There are many more than 50 dead and an enormous number of wounded,'' he said. Earlier, doctors had said there were at least 50 dead at the hospital. Hospitals were short of blood, surgical materials and other supplies and were issuing international appeals for help, he said. Fighting after dawn was still continuing in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, just east of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, a poor district hill district northeast of the city center where some of the strongest Dignity Battalions are based. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were apparently trying to take the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> barracks at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> and helicopters were buzzing the area. On Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rubber-stamp declared that the country was in a `` state of war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and named the general head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer was shot to death by Panamanians in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an unprovoked attack.

 Thirty-eight Latin American stablehands seized at a racetrack a year ago have taken the Fifth Amendment, challenging the government to prove they are illegal aliens. The government says it does n't have to to deport them. While illegal immigrants often do n't know their rights and prefer to go home rather than fight to stay, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> cases are being regarded as a test of aliens' rights. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` is saying the government does n't have to come up with any evidence at all,'' said attorney <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Akram </PERSON>, who is orchestrating the aliens' defense. `` The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has never brought a shred of evidence.'' `` It's a test of what the government burden is,'' said <PERSON> Akram </PERSON>, head of the Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project. `` Can the government haul anybody in off the streets and deport them if they refuse to answer questions based on their constitutional right not to do so? This is ridiculous.'' The defendants were among 83 Salvadoran, Mexican, Brazilian and Cuban stablehands rounded up Oct. 21, 1988 at <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Downs </LOCATION> during a dawn workout. Of the 83 people, six were found to be in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lawfully. Some went home, while others admitted their illegal status and applied for asylum. The rest invoked their Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination at their deportation hearings. They want the government to prove they are here illegally. That is n't happening. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> attorneys are using an argument allowed in civil cases: that silence alone is ground for deportation. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION>' Rights in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, called this development alarming `` It's disturbing if the immigration judge is making an inference from their silence that a person is an alien,'' he said. `` It reverses the whole idea that you are innocent until proven guilty.'' But an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> official says the government is following precedent well-established in civil cases. `` The government does n't have to do any more,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Creppy </PERSON>, acting deputy counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` This is nothing new. The law is pretty clear in this matter. To me it's just a tactic to be able to stay here. Among the 38 aliens who invoked the Fifth Amendment was 21-year-old Salvadoran. His story is typical, said <PERSON> Akram </PERSON>, who requested the man be identified only as <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>. One of 10 children in a farming family, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> is from the mountains of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where the army and the anti-government guerrillas have been waging war. He said both sides terrorize the inhabitants. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> told his attorney that by age 19, he was forced to act four times as a lookout on a guerrilla patrol. He knew better than to object after seeing a friend's face shot off for refusing to act as a guerrilla informant. Last year, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> fled, taking a bus to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. From there, he crossed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border undetected and made his way from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Two months ago, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> had his day in Immigration Court. The attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> questioned him about where he came from and how he got here. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> replied in Spanish, `` I refuse to answer under the protection of the Fifth Amendment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because my answer could incriminate me.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> lawyer then asked the judge to deport him. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>'s case is on appeal before the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON> said the use of the Fifth Amendment in deportation cases is rare but crucial. `` It's an important defense and it would be a tragic betrayal if this was taken away from aliens,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Creppy </PERSON> said the agency feels it will win. `` When you weigh the public interest versus the aliens' interest, this is a case that is clear,'' he said

 Opposition politicians said they hoped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would bring democracy to the country, but supporters of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called it `` genocide against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to `` remove the obstacle of the dictatorship was serious news, but we grasp it with hope,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, who was sworn in as first vice president shortly after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort began. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who spoke on the radio, was a vice presidential candidate in the May 7 elections that were voided when results showed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents winning. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was sworn in as president, and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was sworn in as vice president along with <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. `` Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to celebrate the era of democracy with justice and freedom,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. He urged the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, `` Do n't resist, accept instead the peace that they offer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the military action `` grieves us because it involves mourning and pain, but we pray to God that it will be the new awakening of this nation we love so much.'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he hoped `` with this action we can achieve the Panamanian objectives, among them to immediately establish democracy with full respect for the will of the people.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> held an emergency meeting at an undisclosed site, said the government national radio, broadcasting as the national resistance network. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s presidential candidate in the May 7 elections, called on all `` nationalist parties'' to join in the struggle. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has just committed the biggest error and is going to pay for that,'' he said. <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON>, another party leader, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action an `` infamous invasion.'' He asked Latin American countries to tell the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to stop this genocide against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` We are not going to surrender,'' he said. Not all those outraged by the invasion were <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> backers. A woman in Diablo, just south of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, said: `` This is humiliating. I feel completely impotent. My blood is boiling.'' She said she does not support <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but also does not support the idea of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. As she spoke, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trucks passed on a nearby road and fighting raged near Defense Forces headquarters. `` They are not going to enjoy it,'' she said.

 Here is the text of statements at the Pentagon Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, and questions they fielded at a news conference. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: I think all of you have seen the president's statement explaining the action that he ordered and explaining the background and the rationale for it. Obviously, we've tried for more than two years to resolve by peaceful means the difficult relationship that had developed with the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. This past week it came to a head with the declaration of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a maximum leader and his statement that a state of war existed between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That was, of course, followed by the shooting death of an unarmed American off-duty Marine officer on Saturday and the brutal treatment of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and dependents. On Sunday, the president made the decision to order <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, specifically, as he indicated earlier, with the mission of protecting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives, of protecting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests in connection with our responsibilities under the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty, with the effort being made also to restore democracy and to bring Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice, should we capture him. The order went out late on Sunday to implement a plan that had been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I was briefed on when I became Secretary of Defense last spring. The plan was developed to deal with various contingencies that might arise in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. We have always been concerned for several months by virtue of the fact that there are large numbers of Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, not only those that are there because they've been assigned there, because of their military role and responsibilities, but also American civilians who live in the area The operation is continuing at this time. Some of the reporting we have, obviously, is still fragmentary. It's our intention this morning in this briefing to give you as much information as we reasonably can, given the fact that the operation continues. At this point, of course Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is still at large. He is no longer the maximum leader in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A democratic government has been reestablished with the duly elected officials selected by the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last May. He is, at this point, a fugitive. As Secretary, I want to thank all of those individuals who participated in the operation. It has been carried out in an extremely professional manner. I think they have performed superbly in carrying out their duties and their responsibilities. And, at this point, I'd like, to turn the briefing over to the Chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. Powell: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Let me add my own caution that the operation is only seven hours old and it is still ongoing and may be continuing for some time to come. So we're going to give you as much as we possibly can, but please understand that there will be details that I can not get into for purposes of operational security. As you know, at the direction of the president, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> armed forces undertook operations in combat in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> just prior to 0100 hours this morning, or roughly just before 1 a.m. this morning. The participating units include in-place forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the 193rd <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, which in recent months had been reinforced by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> units, by a battalion from the 7th Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by a mechanized battalion from the 5th Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, as well as additional supporting forces to include military police. In the course of the evening additional forces have been added, and I'll describe how they have been added. Those additional forces include a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, two Ranger battalions, selected special operating units. All of this, of course, was supported superbly by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and there are additional reinforcing units that will assist in stability operations coming from the 7th Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, as well as from the 16th MP brigade at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. As you know, our purpose, as stated by the president, is to protect Americans, to protect the integrity of our treaty, to restore democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and bring to justice the fugitive Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> We conducted operations this morning, beginning just before 1 a.m., in three general areas that Gen. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> will point out on the map. First, in the central <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> zone area, to the east of that, near the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION>, and to the west down by <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. Let me now turn to the larger map and discuss each one of these pieces in turn. Let's start up on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> side, with <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>. Task Force Atlantic consisted of a battalion from the 7th Infantry Division and a battalion from the 82nd Airborne Division, which was in the Jungle Operations Training Center in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Their mission was to secure several critical sites in the southern portion of <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AO </ORGANIZATION> _ the prison at <LOCATION> Gamboa </LOCATION>, which was secured in the course of the morning and within which there are some PDF personnel who had been put in jail as a result of the coup attempt earlier in the fall, and we now have some 47, 48 very happy prisoners who have been released; the electrical distribution center at <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> is now secure; and <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>, a critical facility, is also secure. Other elements of <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> also ensured the security of our installations in the Colon area, and they neutralized the 8th Infantry Company of the PDF, which did not take too active a role in this operation, as well as neutralizing the naval infantry unit, located up toward the north. There is still some sporadic firing up there. The situation is n't completely resolved, but for the most part, <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> has completed its assigned missions.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Criticizes Party's `Negligence'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Urbanek criticizing his Communist
Party for making mistakes. No pickup.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> today said the party leadership had made mistakes marked by `` negligence and irresponsibility'' that led the organization into its worst crisis. Speaking to 1,500 delegates at a special party congress, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> also admitted his own guilt as a member of the ruling Politburo in allowing hated hard-liners to remain in the party leadership. The party was expected to purge its ranks of many discredited party leaders during the two-day meeting. The Communists have been rocked by two shake-ups in the leadership to remove hard-liners and the loss of thousands of members since the country's peaceful pro-democracy movement began four weeks ago, changing the political orientation of the country. The congress, called to determine the party's future in the wake of a revolution that swept a government led by non-Communist into office, scrapped all its party statutes, which could pave the way for a comprehensive organizational reform. Party spokesman <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hora </PERSON> told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> also decided to divide the leadership duties between a general secretary and a party chairman. Former Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who resigned earlier this month after failing to reach agreement with the opposition on a new government, was thought to be a contender for one of the posts, according to congress observers who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Nov. 24, the party ousted hard-line leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and others responsible for the crackdown on the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968, and <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> as party chief. The much despised <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss, <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, was ousted two days later in a further leadership reshuffle that brought unknown Communists to the top. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>'s ouster was demanded by massive protest rallies. Both <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> were later expelled from the party for `` serious political mistakes.'' They had refuted assertions by a parliamentary commission that they were politically responsible for a Nov. 17 police crackdown on peaceful student demonstrators that ignited the ensuing democratic revolution. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said the `` party leadership manifested negligence and irresponsibility worthy of punishment.'' `` With self-criticism, I admit my part of the guilt in'' leaving <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> on the Poliburo, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said, adding that the decision was `` an extraordinary, politically serious mistake.'' Outlining the crisis now faced by the party, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> noted that it had lost 66,290 of its 1.7 million members in the last month. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> also revealed that the party faces bankruptcy, disclosing that party dues were used to build recreation facilities for the top brass `` about which the rank-and-file only learned today.'' The speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds itself following the triumphs of the pro-democracy movement. The most recent victory came on Tuesday as the Communist-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> gave the new reform government a vote of confidence, and endorsed opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> for president. `` There is no doubt that the congress delegates have the duty ... to take the party out of its deepest crisis ever,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Rude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravo </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial today. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a former dissident who emobdies the democracy movement, said on the eve of the party congress that the party should become `` a modern political party which would participate as an equal among equals in the pluralistic system ...'' <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> delegates Tuesday night that new elections to the Politburo are not expected, but suggested it could be replaced by a 21-member `` political executive committee.'' Among the non-voting guests at the congress are former party members expelled after the Soviet invasion of 1968 that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' Communist-led reforms. There are also 40 delegates from the new reformist Communist Democratic Forum, a potential splinter group challenging <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON>'s leadership which submitted a seven point list of demands Earlier this week, the Democratic Forum spokesman, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevratil </PERSON>, said `` the congress will show whether the movment can live within the party.'' The party was also likely to discuss the presidential elections. Communist Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON>, who left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today and was therefore not attending the party congress, gave an unprecedented endorsement to <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s candidacy. The parliament's presidium voted late Tuesday to reconvene the house Dec. 29 at the presidential <LOCATION> Hradcany </LOCATION> castle to cast a public vote for president. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is essentially the only candidate.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: assigned missions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Let me turn now to <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelis </ORGANIZATION>, which is essentially a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> rifle company and a light armored Infantry company, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> as well as some additional MPs assigned to Task Force <PERSON> Semper </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidelis </PERSON>. Their principal mission was to secure the Bridge of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, insure the security of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and environs around <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Task Force Semper Fi has completed their mission successfully. Let me turn now to <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION>, which is off to the west down by <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. For those of you who were here on the third of October, you'll recall that that was the location from which the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> launched their operation to come to the assistance of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during the coup attempt in October. Because of the criticality of that facility as well as two companies located there, a Ranger battalion parachute assaulted onto that location at H-hour, just about 1 a.m. All the things I'm describing so far all took place simultaneously about H-hour, 1 a.m. In the course of their activities there, they succeeded in neutralizing <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. It is under our control. Some of the members of the 6th and <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> have dispersed away from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, but we also took a number of prisoners. So it is neutralized and Task Force Red has accomplished its mission and is sweeping up in the area. If I could now turn into the Task Force Bayonet area in the central section, the narrowest zone there. Task Force Bayonet consisted of a Mechanized battalion, the force of the 6th Mechanized. It also was supported by a platoon of light tanks as well as the 5th battalion of the 87th Infantry. And the mission of Task Force Bayonet was two-fold really: to provide security for our major facilities in the Task Force Bayonet area of operations and the principal combat mission performed by the Mechanized battalion was to seize the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the PDF, Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters, and that was also done beginning at about one in the morning. They have accomplished that mission. The headquarters has been reduced. There has been considerable burning. I'm not quite sure how much of it has been burned out, but there has been quite a bit of fire down there. But they, for the most part _ most part have accomplished their mission. There is sporadic firing that continues in the area, and some of the PDF members who were in the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION> have now slipped out and are mixing in with the general population. And so there will still be a need for mopping up and stability operations in support of the new government. The forces that were opposing them in the vicinity of the Comandancia are shown under the Comandancia listing, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, and elements of the Sixth and Seventh Infantry, which I mentioned were out at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. Then we also mentioned that as part of Task Force Bayonet, another unit was flown across the entrance of the canal in order to block the <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> which is at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, and at the moment there is continuing work down there to completely neutralize the Fifth Infantry Company. But for the most part, Task Force Bayonet has accomplished its mission and is undertaking stability and sweep-up operations. Let me turn now to the East to Task Force Red. Task Force Red consisted of another Ranger battalion which parachutists assaulted in at H-hour. Their mission was to take over the international airfield, get it ready for follow-on forces coming from the 82nd Airborne, and begin to block access for Battalion 2000, which as you know, also played an instrumental role in the events of Oct. 3. The <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> landed on the ground, quickly seized the airport, began to put out patrols to the East. They were assisted, and I might add that throughout the area of operations, the special forces group elements belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> have been performing reconnaissance and surveillance, and some of those reconnaissance and surveillance efforts cut out to the <LOCATION> Pacora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> early and blocked that. here was some fighting out there but no main elements of <ORGANIZATION> PDF </ORGANIZATION> units came down the road in the direction of the city, and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> are now out in that location as well. Beginning 55 minutes after H-hour, or about 1:55 this morning, the first element of the 82 Airborne Division Ready Brigade arrived, 10 C-141s, and they conducted a parachute assault onto the international airfield in that vicinity. Ten C-141s arrived several hours later and at 0515 the second half of the 82 Airborne Division parachuted in. And their mission is sort of depicted by the arrows. They will move, one arrow going out to make sure battalion 2000 stays where it is.

In order to continue our stability operations and to make sure we really accomplish our mission of protecting Americans and assisting the newly inaugurated government, additional forces are being brought down from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the 7th Infantry division, a brigade, and as I mentioned earlier, the 16th MP brigade will be sending additional elements down. In the process of these operations we also took special actions to immobilize the PDF navy. They have a small fleet of boats which were immobilized. And we also took actions to immobilize aircraft that could have been used for escape purposes. All of these actions that I have mentioned were marvelously supported by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> gunships; magnificent support from the military airlift command, <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, and refueling tankers from the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, Special Operations units as well as Special Forces reconnaissance and surveillance units. Let me mention a few specific events that I know are of interest to you. There are reports of hostages. We are chasing these reports. In some cases hostages were taken and then released. And I do n't want to go into any numbers or details because this is an ongoing operation, except to let you know that we are looking into every one of these and we believe we have adequate resources in the area to deal with that situation.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sensing an opening brought about by a series of events last weekend in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, moved to end almost two years of frustration by sending in the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> from power. The operation may answer critics who ridiculed the decision to stay off to the side during the failed October coup attempt, but the early hours of fighting showed the attack was fraught with military and diplomatic risk. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial concern is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be found by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces quickly, with minimal loss of life, and brought to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for trial on drug trafficking charges. In the early going, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was elusive and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers _ at least nine of them _ died. Some 7,000 soldiers and Marines were sent overnight into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to bolster the 12,000 Americans already stationed there. Substantial bloodshed could turn political and public opinion against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> operation, especially if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was to remain at large. It was n't clear from the initial reaction whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public would support an operation that involved extensive bloodshed and drags on inconclusively for days or even longer. If the operation seems more like <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in trouble. Most of the initial congressional reaction was supportive. But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Personally, unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> or against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people or installations, I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without the support of other Central American nations. The administration braced for criticism from many in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, given the aversion throughout the hemisphere to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unilateral action. Officials believed some would argue the operation was a direct violation of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> charters, both of which stress the importance of non-interference in a country's internal affairs. In <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s view, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had to go and nothing else had worked. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had used an impressive array of weapons _ diplomatic, economic, political _ against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for almost two years but he seemed to be able to laugh off everything <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tried. Unlike Chinese leaders, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was held in such ill repute that he never was a candidate for a we-can-do-business-together visit from national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seemed entrenched, surviving repudiation by neighbors and growing economic deprivation among his countyrmen. He called an election, then threw out the returns when the results did n't please him. When rebel officers had him in their clutches last October during a coup attempt, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> managed to talk his way out of it. Since February 1988, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had been saying, `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go.'' But he would n't, and did n't. One key question mark is the degree to which President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is perceived as the legitimate leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. His strength is that he is seen as the winner of the May elections but his burden is that he was sworn in as president an hour before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations began in earnest this morning. Another potential risk is that the 35,000 Americans living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, may be the targets of resentment _ or worse _ from Panamanians who believe the invasion was uncalled for. Is it possible the outrage among some Panamanians will be such that acts of sabotage will be carried out against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>? The irony of today's action is that when the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took office, there seemed to be a greater disposition to try to work in concert with other <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries to solve the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> problem. A U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediation effort begun last spring with the aim of achieving a democratic transfer of power collapsed in August. The impetus for direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action seemed to gain in October when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was widely criticized for not acting more assertively in support of the rebel insurrection against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was looking for an excuse to act, a series of events starting last Friday gave him his opening. One was a Panamanian government declaration of a `` state of war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Another contributing factor was the tense situation which ensued, marked by the death of one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman and the harassment of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> couple. In both cases, members of the Panamanian military were involved. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had had enough, and the stage was set for the most controversial decision of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s capture would enable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges brought against him in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The indictments against the Panamanian leader were unsealed Feb. 5, 1988, and marked the first time federal charges were filed against a foreign leader who was not in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Fifteen other people also face charges in the case. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than $ 1.1 million in fines if convicted. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment charges <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with conspiracy, racketeering, importing drugs and traveling to further the conspiracy. It accuses him of: _ Accepting a $ 4.6 million bribe from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel to protect s augment the force. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` reckless'' behavior had `` created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> base <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the capital. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s main bodyguard, Lt. <PERSON> Asuncion </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, spoke on the national radio network after dawn to say that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` well and in a safe place.'' `` Do n't anyone give up your positions. In the provinces, prepare to resist. The attacks are going to continue when they find we are not going to cede,'' he said. <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s prime bodyguard, then gave a series of messages using code names and instructions. The codes mentioned names like `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>,'' or said, `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, take the man to the hangar and <PERSON> Yeyo </PERSON>.'' Others were more comprehensible. One was a reference to the so-called civilian Dignity Battalions of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists. `` Dignity Battalions operate in small operations during the day or look for positions and mix with the people who support you and at night move and act against the enemy positions in the periphery of the city,'' ran one. Meanwhile, casualty reports were climbing. Dr. <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Santo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said wounded had been coming in all night and the number increased with daybreak. `` There are many more than 50 dead and an enormous number of wounded,'' he said. Earlier, doctors had said there were at least 50 dead at the hospital. Hospitals were short of blood, surgical materials and other supplies and were issuing international appeals for help, he said. Fighting after dawn was still continuing in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, just east of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, a poor district hill district northeast of the city center where some of the strongest Dignity Battalions are based. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were apparently trying to take the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> barracks at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> and helicopters were buzzing the area. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> prepared to meet in emergency session Wednesday morning to debate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attack. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> requested the emergency meeting. On Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rubber-stamp declared that the country was in a `` state of war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and named the general head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer was shot to death by Panamanians in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an unprovoked attack.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today swiftly condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assault to seize <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, while <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> praised it as a `` courageous decision.'' `` Someone has to uphold democracy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. Reactions contrasted sharply as news flashed around the world that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had ordered troops to capture Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988. Among other Western allies, Dutch Foreign Minister <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> said in a radio interview that he sympathized partly because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had been endangered recently in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> zone. Tensions had been rising in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian forces after Panamanians killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant on Saturday in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an unprovoked attack. Foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> conferred by telephone on the situation, then agreed to meet in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> tonight to discuss the developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and issue a declaration, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was part of the so called <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION> but was excluded after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in 1988. The group has condemned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, but it has also advanced a consistent rejection of any direct intervention of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> expressed regret today about the use of force by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but was sympathetic to the American action under the circumstances. A statement from External Affairs Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> also said that `` intervention by force is a dangerous precedent,'' adding that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> notes that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> relied on force as a last resort after failing to resolve the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> peacefully. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> said he `` deeply lamented'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. He said the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government, `` which always has been opposed to foreign military intervention, expresses its hope that the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people can decide their future in freedom.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said he hoped the confrontation would end soon. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has long been expressing its hope to see a democratic government established in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that reflects the will of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service quoted <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> as telling Japanese reporters. `` We hope this takes place as soon as possible.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said, `` These actions, a violation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter and generally recognized rules of state relations, should be condemned by the international community. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must immediately stop its armed intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Perfiliev, quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action, `` whatever its motivation, has provoked a feeling of serious concern in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of invading <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in what in called `` an act of aggression.'' <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> also said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action was unacceptable. `` <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> has always considered as unacceptable any foreign _ and especially a military _ intervention under any excuse, as it represents a crude violation of sovereignty,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> spoke to reporters on the steps of her 10 Downing Street office after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned at 7 a.m. -LRB- 2 a.m. EST -RRB- to tell her the military assault was under way. They spoke for 10 minutes. `` I said we would fully support him in the action he was taking to bring an end to this rule of terror,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` I believe he was right to do so. I believe this is what friends are for, to give support at this time. It was a courageous decision.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> called on other world leaders to declare support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying, `` Every action has a risk and it is important that it be successful.'' `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is wanted on drugs allegations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We are fighting terror and the battle against drugs as well. The rule of democracy should be upheld,'' she added. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s warm response contrasted with her sharp criticism of the U.S.-led invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983 to topple a leftist administration in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island. <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> is a former British colony that regards <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as its titular head of state. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action, saying it had `` nothing to do with democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and everything to do with protecting the American interests in the canal zone.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: that situation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 With respect to General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, as you know, we're only seven hours into this operation. We have not yet located the general. He has a habit of changing locations in normal times four or five times a night. But we will continue our efforts to locate him. But, as a practical matter, we have decapitated him from the dictatorship of this country and he is now a fugitive and will be treated as such. With respect to the embassy, the American embassy did take some fire in the course of the evening. Nobody was injured. There was some minor damage to the embassy. And we have <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> forces in strength at the embassy to secure it. As you know, there is a new government in place. And I will talk briefly about the casualty figures. As you know, this is preliminary, and I want to reemphasize that the numbers I'm about to give you are preliminary and are subject to change as we move in the course of the morning and get better information. At the moment, the figures I have from the Southern Command provide the information that nine Americans were killed in action. Thirty-nine Americans were wounded in action. One American is missing. Several aircraft were damaged. They include several C-130s and some helicopters and I have no information that I'm comfortable with PDF casualties to provide at this time. That concludes my briefing. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, do you see the need to send further reinforcements or are we seeing all of the forces that are going to be necessary? Powell: The forces I mentioned that are being sent in now for reinforcement, the Seventh Division and the MPs, I think that'll do it. I think that'll bring it up to around 24,000 and that's really not for sustained combat but for stability operations to make sure that we are truly controlling the situation. Q: ... 24,0000, you're sending in or does that include ... <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: No, that's total including those that were there to begin with. Q: So that includes the ones that are in now, Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> ...? Powell: Yes, total. Q: or the ones that will be in? Powell: That includes all that we are planning including those that are in the reinforcement package coming. And that is, as you know, a number that can float around as we adjust our plans in the course of the day. Q: How many have been sent in so far? Powell: There were 13,000 to begin with _ <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: who were already there. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: who were already there as part of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> assets before the operation began overnight and so far we have introduced close to another 7,000 and we have roughly 2,500, I believe, on the way, from the Seventh Division and the 16th MP Brigade. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, what about members of the 82nd Airborne and some of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> who were brought in. I know you say you want to get them out as quickly as possible. When can we expect that they will be sent home? Powell: Well, the primary mission right now is to make sure the situation is under control and we have satisfied our objectives and then as soon as that is as we would like it to be and we're sure that things are settled down, we will start to retrograde those soldiers as quickly as possible, but I do n't have a specific timeline yet. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> ... Do you have any evidence that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was about to threaten the operations of the Canal? Powell: I have heard those reports. He has been saying this for years and years so those reports would not surprise me. But I do n't know that I want to get into specific reports Q: -LRB- Inaudible -RRB- <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: Nothing that came to my attention that caused me great concern. We had deployed our forces in a way that provided, I believe, adequate protection of the Canal. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, can you tell us where President <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was sworn in, who did it? I mean, tell us a little bit about that scenario. Can you? <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: He was sworn in shortly before the operation. I do n't have the details and I think I'd better _ I need to refer you to the State Department for those kinds of answers It was a Panamanian. He was sworn in by a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> justice of some kind and it was done an hour before, but with respect to ... Q: At an American base? Powell: Yes. But I really need to refer you to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, because it was handled by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, what assurances do you have that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is n't going to escape into the countryside and organize some kind of guerrilla operations to keep harassing <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> forces down there Powell: Oh, he can do that, and we will chase them and we will find him. Q: Do you know that he's still in the country? Powell: No, I do n't know that. We _ he is a very canny individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to survive catastrophe. And we'll see over time whether he survives this catastrophe. Q: General, now would n't he make life miserable for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces down there? Powell: I doubt it. No. I do n't think, one, it's been some years since General _ Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the fugitive, has been seen in the jungle, living in the jungle. He's used to a different kind of lifestyle, and I'm not quite sure he would be up to being chased around the countryside by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and Light Infantry units of the Joint Operations Training Center. But you might _ I ca n't rule that out, but I think that's rather far fetched.

 Lithuanian Communists overwhelmingly approved a resolution today calling for an end to their subordination to the Soviet Communist Party. A final vote on formally establishing a fully independent <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was delayed by several hours of debate on procedural questions. By a vote of 838-142, the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress _ meeting in the capital, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> _ approved a resolution calling for `` relations of equal partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, other progressive parties, public organizations and movements.'' Lithuanian Communists, who supported a legislative move Dec. 7 to strike the leading role of the party from the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s constitution, are spurred by the need to compete with the grass-roots political movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> and other newly formed parties in local elections Feb. 24 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has appealed to Lithuanian Communists not to break away, saying a split will damage his reform efforts. A formal break would run counter to more than 80 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> practice and policy. Since before the 1917 Russian Revolution, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> demanded a unified party covering the entire territory of the czarist empire. In 1921, the party outlawed the existence of factions. Sajudis observers say local Communist Parties in other republics such as <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> could follow <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s example soon and present <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with a splintered party when he convenes the 28th national party congress in the fall.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: the actions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: Well, when you went into <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> you had _ we had support right at the outset, the people were brought in to say they supported this action. But here, you're not able to say that at this point? <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: Well, this was a different situation. Q: Why? Cheney: I mean, there's always a tendency to want to compare this operation with the last operation, and obviously, both are military operations. But in the case of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, there were no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces present on the Island; we were invited by the governments of the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to come in and provide support. In the case of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, there is a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence there; we are in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with significant military force because we have a right to be under the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties. It's just a different set of circumstances. In this case the president felt very strongly, and this was the basic justification for undertaking the operation, that it was necessary in order to safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives and, at the same time, to restore democracy to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Q: Will this hurt us, though, with other <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> countries _ once again, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> imposing his will? <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: Well I would hope not. I would hope that other Central American countries would recognize that what we have done is to participate in the removal of a drug trafficker, a man who was a dictator, a self-described Maximum Leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a man who had brutally treated not only Americans but also Panamanian citizens, a man who had annulled the last election and defied the will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be governed by Mr. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, and that our action is justified and will produce a democratic government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I think that's a _ the way for it to be viewed, and I would hope that other governments in the hemisphere recognize the reasons why the president took the action and the result that will come from it. Q: Mr. Secretary, following the failed coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, you came into this room and you made a number of arguments justifying our decision not to get more heavily involved. You pointed to the risk of inserting American forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and you said it was n't up to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, I think as you put it, `` To the willy-nilly around the world knocking off governments, this was something the Panamanians would have to do for themselves. Why is your earlier assessment, which you made in this room two months ago not valid anymore? Cheney: No, I am not sure I'd agree with your assessment of my earlier assessment, but I think that there were significant changes as a result of the actions of the past week, and that what was different was that on Saturday, for example, an unarmed American officer was shot and killed by the PDF, that this came about after Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had had himself declared Maximum Leader and then indicated that a state of war existed between <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I think we as a government bent over backwards to avoid having to take military action. I think the record is replete with the patience and forbearance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government in this instance. When it reached the point however, when it was clear that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives were at risk, when it reached the point where it was clear that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had created an environment in which his troops felt free to terrorize and brutalize Americans who had every legitimate and lawful right to be in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, that was a fundamentally different set of circumstances. Q: Mr. Secretary ... what sort of threat do the ` dignity battalions' now pose for these operations? Cheney: I'd defer to the general on that. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: Well, we're watching them carefully. It's not clear _ it's not clear how many of them are real battalions and how many are just thugs and rabble rousers that would simply melt away. They have not caused us any difficulty yet, but they have the potential of sniping and things like that. Q: Is n't the fact that there are so many _ there are 23,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, some dependents, some of military personnel living there, there, do you think this is a particularly dangerous operation, and what was done to protect them?

<HEAD>Important Records Missing in Detroit Police Fund Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators looking into what happened to $ 1 million paid out of a <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> undercover operations fund said important documents on a former deputy chief suspected of stealing from the account have vanished. The missing documents detail <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s involvement with the fund, Executive Deputy Chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He's gone. The records are gone. ... He was last known to be the custodian'' of most of the documents, <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said. Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, a former civilian deputy police chief, stole from the fund, which finances undercover operations of the narcotics division. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> was in charge of sensitive security work for the police from 1980 to 1986. He resigned in 1986 after an investigation into a precious-metals investments deal in which several Detroit-area investors lost several thousand dollars. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> has not been seen or heard from publicly since the federal and city investigations began several weeks ago. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has refused to discuss the scope or any other details of its investigation into the fund. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office are trying to determine whether <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund for personal use. <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON> said a substantial number of documents were gone, including some subpoenaed under federal and city orders. He said a theft report was filed. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> subpoenaed financial records from 1985 to 1987, and city auditors began examining documents Tuesday. Release of the records averted a court battle between Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and the council, which had issued a subpoena demanding a chance to review the records. `` The mayor's concern all along was to protect the integrity of the grand jury process and the integrity of the secret service fund,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. Young, who initially said he never would give the documents to city auditors and the council, refused to say why he changed his mind.

 A lawyer for Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader would die rather than surrender to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sent to bring him to this country to face drug charges. Panamanian exiles here celebrated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug charges in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> in 1988. Attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said he talked with the general Monday evening. `` We discussed various things, including this very real possibility -LRB- of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action -RRB-,'' the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> lawyer said in a telephone interview. The attorney said he had planned to fly to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> this evening to meet with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. This morning, he spoke with members of the general's staff who did n't know his whereabouts. `` He's a fighter,'' <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said. `` I feel unhappily secure in my belief that he will be killed, he will not be captured. Should that occur, the truth will never come out.'' <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> questioned news accounts that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had declared war on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which he described as `` just some more propaganda that's come across again out of context.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>, assigned as the trial judge in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment, said today: `` If General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is apprehended and brought here for trial, he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused of a crime _ no more, no less. All his rights will be protected.'' Also closely following events were members of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Panamanian exile community, including <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, cousin of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who won the country's May election but was blocked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from taking power. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> declared himself president shortly after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action began. `` I can assure you 99.99 percent of all Panamanians are up. I know of at least five parties going on -LRB- in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in an early-morning telephone interview. He added that he had been in telephone contact with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Many of the opposition's key people have taken refuge in safe places since we had reports way back from before the elections of May that the dignity brigades -LRB- armed citizens who support <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- had lists of key opposition people to attack should something like this happen,'' he said. Convinced the military action would be a success, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> predicted many Panamanians living in this country would return to their homeland afterward. `` Exiles will probably return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> once everything is back to normality,'' he said. `` We will probably see for the first time an emigration back to a country that has been liberated.'' Another Panamanian in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said that if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is captured, he will have to `` face all the things that he has done to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people.'' `` I think he owes to the Panamanians many things and this is the first thing we have to face,'' said <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, founder of the National Civic Crusade in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We would like to find the truth of all the cases pending and try him in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: protect them?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>: Well, I think a key part of the plan that Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> may want to address was to wrap up the PDF as quickly as possible, if you will, and to provide security for the Americans living in the area. We reached the judgment that, in the long run, Americans were going to be more secure, that their safety was likely to be greater, the risk likely to be reduced if we acted now rather than if we waited and let the situation continue to spiral out of control. Q: Mr. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> ... do you think there will be additional casualties as the mopping up continues? Cheney: I do n't have any way to know that. I do n't have any way to know. Q: What are the last pockets of resistance? Can you run over that, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON>, and tell us? Powell: Oh, there is a little bit at the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION>, just some sniping coming out, and we still have a slight problem down on <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> area with the 5th Infantry company. But that's pretty much it. There's a little bit of firing out by the <LOCATION> Pacora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, but it's really not ... Q: The MO has basically been for resistance, and then they sort of break up and fade off into the neighborhoods? Is that ... Powell: That's what we have seen. Q: How do you deal with that, in the days or hours ahead here, if you have a lot of armed people who at least formerly were pro-Noriega. Powell: What we have to find out is whether or not they are an armed resistance force or just individuals who now are just criminals and thugs running around the countryside. We'll just have to wait and see how it plays out. Q: Do you have large numbers of PDF now willing to work with you? Have you begun the liaison? Powell: We'll still sorting out the pieces. We have a fairly significant number of detainees, I'll call them for the moment, and we'll sort that over time _ sort that out over time. You've just got to bear with us. We're only a few hours into this. Q: Gen. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, you've said several times that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally is a fugitive. Yet Panamanian broadcasts suggest that he's still running the show militarily. What have you got to indicate that he is in fact a fugitive on the run? <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: Because he is a fugitive. We're looking for him. He's not running anything, because we own all of the bases he owned eight hours ago Q: How convinced are you that you will get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and will you call this operation a success if you do n't? <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: I'm not a fortune teller as to whether we will get him, or when we will get him. I think the operation is a success already because we cut off the head of that government and there is a new government that was elected by the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, waiting, willing and ready to take over. And I hope that's what will happen. I hope what we will do is assist them in standing up and taking over, and I think the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will rally to this government. Q: General, would you say that the operation has lasted more than what you expected? Did you intend it to be a more a surgical strike, or do you think ... <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: I had no set timelines in mind. I really was n't sure. It could have been over quickly. It could linger for days or weeks. I just do n't know, and I'd just be wildly speculating with you at this time. I'll know better later in the day, I think. Q: Does that mean the operation _ the operation is n't over and we need to get _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- Q: Have we communicated with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and did they protest? Cheney: I'll direct you to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Q: Thank you all very much. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>: Could I just say that I hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was, and how competently it was carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We all, the Secretary and I, all of our associates, deeply regret the loss of American life. But that's sometimes necessary in pursuit of our national interests and in the fight for democracy. Thank you.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said today that there will be fear among Panamanians until Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is captured or otherwise removed from the scene. `` Having him loose does raise the potential that he might raise more mischief,'' said <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires. `` I have the concern that until he is in custody, there is still going to be a great deal of concern and fear among the Panamanians.'' <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> made his comments to a group of reporters at a heavily guarded fort on the outskirts of the city. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may take to the hills and be very hard to find ... -LRB- but -RRB- he would n't have a significant force to actually do anything,'' <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said. `` He will get very little support from the people.'' The news group from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was shuttled to the fort by helicopter from <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base only 10,000 yards from where the briefing was held because the military considered it unsafe to drive. The reporters were given six copies of a videotape of the swearing-in of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s newly elected leadership. The officials themselves were in hiding because it was still too risky for them to appear anywhere in public, <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said. He would not disclose their whereabouts. The three Panamanian leaders _ considered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have won an election last May _ met with <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> on Monday evening and were told of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military plan. They approved of it in a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said. The officials _ President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, and Vice Presidents <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Guillermo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> _ were sworn in at an undisclosed site early Wednesday as the military action was getting under way. The oath was witnessed by two officials of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s human rights association, because no Panamanian government official could be enlisted to participate. <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> raised the possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could slip into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` He may be in the embassies right now, hiding,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was hit by one or possibly two rounds believed from a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in Wednesday's fighting. The new Panamanian government was hoping to go soon to the presidential house once the fighting is over. The leaders were welcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help they had eschewed earlier because of the experience and aftermath of the Oct. 3 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` There were n't too many Panamanians left with guns who were willing to do it,'' <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said. `` When <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is captured, there will be an immense sigh of relief.''

 The leftist Sandinista government put its armed forces on maximum alert today, mobilized troops and tanks and called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` a serious threat to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Large howitzers were set up in the center of downtown <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and Red Beret special forces in camouflage uniforms were posted at the international airport. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Orgega </PERSON> declared a `` state of national alert'' and asked for an urgent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> agreed to meet in emergency session today. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also sent messages to the <ORGANIZATION> Non-Aligned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> saying he was `` deeply concerned by the invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it is a threat to the peace and security of all <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and especially constitutes a serious threat to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a communique read on <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio. The army was put on a `` state of combative general alert.'' The communique said that implied immediate deployment of land, sea and air combat units. Reserves and civilian militia also were called up. Reporters saw Soviet-made T-55 tanks moving through the capital. At least 20 howitzers were set up in the old shell of the city center, flattened in the 1972 earthquake and fires, and never rebuilt. `` When the world is demanding dialogue, peaceful solution of conflicts and renunciation of the threat and use of force ... actions like those that are causing destruction and death in our sister state of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> threaten the security and precarious stability of the Central American region,'' said the communique. In declaring the state of alert, the government mentioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasions of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> earlier this century and continuing confrontation over U.S.-supported Contra rebels in the past 10 years.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address to the nation Wednesday on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Fellow citizens, last night I ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. No president takes such action lightly. This morning, I want to tell you what I did and why I did it. For nearly two years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, nations of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> have worked together to resolve the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The goals of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been to safeguard the lives of Americans, to defend democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, to combat drug trafficking and to protect the integrity of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty. Many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and negotiations. All were rejected by the dictator of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, General <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, an indicted drug trafficker. Last Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> declared his military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and publicly threatened the lives of Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The very next day forces under his command shot and killed an unarmed American serviceman, wounded another, arrested and brutally beat a third American serviceman and then brutally interrogated his wife, threatening her with sexual abuse. That was enough. General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an immminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. As president, I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and to bring General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I contacted the bipartisan leadership of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last night and informed them of this decision, and after taking this action, I also talked with leaders in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, and those of other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. At this moment, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, including forces deployed from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last night, are engaged in action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to withdraw the forces newly deployed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as quickly as possible. All forces have conducted themselves courageously and selflessly, and as commander-in-chief, I salute every one of them and thank them on behalf of our country. Tragically, some Americans have lost their lives in defense of their fellow citizens, in defense of democracy, and my heart goes out to their families. We also regret and mourn the loss of innocent Panamanians. The brave Panamanians elected by the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the elections last May, President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and Vice Presidents <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, have assumed the rightful leadership of their country. You remember those horrible pictures of newly-elected Vice President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> covered head to toe with blood, beaten mercilessly by so-called `` dignity battalions.'' Well, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today recognizes the democratically elected government of President <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. I will send our ambassador back to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> immediately. Key military objectives have been achieved. Most organized resistance has been eliminated. But the operation is not over yet. General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is in hiding. And nevertheless, yesterday, a dictator ruled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and today, constitutionally-elected govern _ elected leaders govern. I have today directed the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the secretary of state to lift the economic sanctions with respect to the democratically elected government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and in cooperation with that government, to take steps to effect an orderly unblocking of Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I am fully committed to implement the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION> and turn over the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the year 2000. The actions we have taken and the cooperation of a new democratic government in <LOCATION> Pamana </LOCATION> will permit us to honor these commitments. As soon as the new government recommends a qualified candidate, Panamanian, to be administrator of the canal, as called for in the treaties, I will submit this nominee to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for expedited consideration. I am committed to strengthening our relationship with the democratic nations in this hemisphere. I will continue to seek solutions to the problems of this region through dialogue and multilateral diplomacy. I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were in grave danger. I hope that the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will put this dark chapter of dictatorship behind them and move forward together as citizens of a democratic <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with this government that they themselves have elected. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is eager to work with the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people in partnership and friendship to rebuild their economy. The <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people want democracy, peace, and the chance for a better life in dignity and freedom. The people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals. Thank you very much.

 A campus detective says he waited five years for the other shoe to drop _ make that shoes, dozens of shoes. That's what happened Tuesday when <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> police questioned a 33-year-old <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> man who admitted taking side trips to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for five years to steal shoes from students at campus libraries. Most of the shoes taken were men's penny loafers and deck shoes that students had kicked off while working. The man, identified as an assistant business professor at a private college, said he took shoes from libraries at UW-Madison, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Normal </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> at Champagne-Urbana, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> would not identify the man but said he had been convicted of theft in a missing shoe case at <LOCATION> Illinois-Normal </LOCATION> in July and is seeing a therapist. During six weeks in 1988, 12 pairs of shoes were stolen from the two UW-Madison libraries. Typically, a student would get up to get a drink of water and return to find his shoes gone. Police stepped up patrols in the libraries with no success. The break in the case came after shoes was stolen from a student Dec. 9, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. The victim and a friend saw a man hanging around at the library with a pair of shoes sticking out of his backpack and questioned him, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said. The shoes were not the student's, but the man identified himself with an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> driver's license. When two more thefts were reported the same day, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> tracked down the man. Police found 80 pairs of shoes in his apartment. The man claimed he had purchased 60 of them. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said the man told him if the shoes he took fit, he kept them. Others he donated to charities. No charges were immediately filed. At least 34 unsolved shoe theft cases are pending in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tried to reassure opponents of German reunification today and said their fears of an evil German empire based on past horrors are `` absurd.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, during a news conference closing a triumphant two-day visit, also said he expects a treaty expanding East and West German ties to be completed by May. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met with Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> on Tuesday, and the two later announced plans for the treaty and a number of other changes: _ The famed <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, isolated in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was built in 1961, will be reopened by Christmas _ Germans will be allowed to travel without visas between the two states beginning Christmas Eve _ <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will free all political prisoners, with many to be released before Christmas <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> pledged to take into account the concerns of other European countries as the two German states, created after World War II, move closer together. `` It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live together,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> pledged to avoid `` destabilization,'' a reference to the power vacuum in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that has followed the virtual collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control here since a popular revolution began in the fall. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> added: `` Fears based in the past are understandable, but there is nothing to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk about a Fourth Reich.'' East German Communists and other opponents of reunification have said joining the two states could create a `` Fourth Reich,'' and have reminded people of the atrocities of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. In meeting with several opposition groups, including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, Democratic Awakening, and others, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he heard none of them voice opposition to eventual reunification. New Forum representative <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaatz </PERSON> told the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> he found `` broad agreement'' with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and that his group was `` thankful'' for the results of the summit. Earlier today, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinelt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterzinsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sterzinsky </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Reinelt </PERSON> explained their views on future cooperation with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the meeting with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sterzinsky </PERSON> said he expects <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to `` treat us as a partner and help with our renewal.'' He viewed the visit by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, as `` entirely positive,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted unidentified officials in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> as saying <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> will be open to pedestrians Friday. The newspaper said its report would appear in Thursday's editions. It was sent in advance to other news media today. The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of German unity to millions and was a centerpiece of a major <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> thoroughfare before the wall was built 28 years ago. Under the pressure of massive pro-democracy demonstrations starting in October, openings have been made in the wall, two sets of Communist leaders have been ousted, and free elections are scheduled in May. At the same time, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has warmly accepted all East German refugees and offered to help revive its neighbor's struggling economy. At a joint news conference after their summit, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> said their talks had made progress toward what the two nations refer to as a `` treaty community.'' Such an arrangement would safeguard the sovereignty of both states. Talks leading up to the planned bilateral treaty could focus on improving traffic connections, telecommunications and pollution problems, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. Both leaders agreed to meet again in late January or early February in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> stressed the `` right of self-determination'' for citizens in both <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the issue of reunification, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> called for the continued existence of two German states. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> joined his host in counseling caution and patience. Later, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> received an emotional welcome from a crowd of about 20,000 at an outdoor evening rally. People repeatedly burst into wild cheers, applause and chants of `` Unity!'' `` Unity!'' as <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> addressed them as his `` countrymen.'' Many waved West German flags, outnumbering those carrying signs insisting on East German sovereignty or attacking <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>.

 A Soviet rocket blasted off today carrying the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific experiment to the Mir space station. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said the Progress M-2 cargo rocket lifted off on schedule at 6:31 a.m. and was functioning normally. It is scheduled to dock with the Mir in two days. Along with food, water and 90 pounds of New Year's presents for two Soviet cosmonauts on the Mir, the rocket carries an experiment for growing protein crystals in space, developed by Payload Systems of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Flights of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle are too short to grow many kinds of crystals, whereas on Mir, the Soviet orbital platform launched in February 1986, they would have months to develop. Such research has applications in the development of pharmaceutical products and the improvement of existing drugs. The crystal-growing experiment is to begin aboard Mir on Dec. 25 and run for 56 days. It will be returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> Feb. 24 in a Soyuz-TM capsule.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people today that he sent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces into a surprise overnight assault in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to end a `` dark chapter of dictatorship'' by <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and forestall a `` grave danger'' to the 35,000 Americans living there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered American forces to apprehend <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> so he could be put on trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking, but he acknowledged that <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> remained at large. `` We will chase him and we will find him,'' vowed the nation's top military officer, Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> He said reinforcements flown to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and those on the way would bring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force there to 24,000. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said nine Americans were killed in action, 39 were wounded and one was missing. He said he did not know how many Panamanians had died. The Pentagon codenamed the mission `` Operation Just Cause.'' In a nationally televised Oval Office speech at 7:20 a.m. EST, a somber <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were in grave danger,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The White House said the decision had been reached Sunday, after an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer was shot and killed outside <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military headquarters <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered this explanation: `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. As president, I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and to bring General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But while key military objectives had been achieved and most organized resistance eliminated, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` the operation is not over yet. Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is in hiding.'' `` Nevertheless, yesterday a dictator ruled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and today constitutionally elected leaders govern,'' the president said. One intelligence source on Capitol <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said there had been reports in recent months of a deterioration in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s mental state, including increased paranoia and constant drinking. But the source cautioned that the reports were not based on hard evidence and he discounted their importance as a factor in the launching of today's military action. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials noted that leaders of a failed coup attempt last October had said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been drinking heavily and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he had heard reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been threatening operations of the canal. After his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed an order lifting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and directing `` an orderly unblocking of Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Separately, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a memo to the Pentagon specifically authorizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to apprehend <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` and any other persons in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> currently under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug-related offenses'' and to turn them over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement officials. However, his declaration that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had so far eludd the grasp of American forces left the overall success of the military mission in question. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who won last May's election in results that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> refused to accept, was hastily sworn in as president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And he said he was committed to implement the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties and surrender control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the year 2000. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s swift action stood in contrast to his inaction last October, when he kept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces on the sidelines while some Panamanian generals sought to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in a coup. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew heavy congressional criticism at that time. As evidence, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last week declared his `` military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He also recited a series of events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past few days, including the fatal shooting of an American military officer. `` Tragically some Americans have lost their lives in defense of their fellow citizens, in defense of democracy,'' the president said. He expressed his condolences to their families and said he regretted that some innocent Panamanians also had been killed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the forces flown overnight to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> would be withdrawn `` as quickly as possible.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said nearly 7,000 additional soliders and paratroopers had arrived from stateside bases and 2,500 were en route this morning to supplement those troops based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he informed congressional leaders and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies about his decision. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, predicted, `` The majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will feel good by this turn of events.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action `` was made necessary by the reckless actions of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without the support of other Central American nations. At an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, called at the request of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s envoy, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> issued a statement asking the organization to recognize <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON> as its ambassador to the OAS. The statement was faxed to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, according to the sign-off. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s representative, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, stayed in the chair designated for his country. `` I am the representative of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and I denounce this criminal aggression,'' he told a reporter. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration sent a cable to Soviet officials informing them of the action. The Soviets swiftly condemned the move as a violation of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> charter. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had tried repeatedly _ but unsuccessfully _ to use diplomacy and negotiation to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and that it was now recognizing the `` democratically elected government.'' The president spoke after only a few hours of sleep. He had stayed in the Oval Office until a few minutes after 4 a.m. to monitor developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and was in time for his speech that began shortly after 7 a.m. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other top aides also were at the White House for much of the night. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> were in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s military command center Beginning with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the administration did what it could to preserve secrecy of the operation before <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s dramatic announcement about the military action. The president hosted a White House Christmas party attended by reporters, but gave no hint of the impending action. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a tradition of long standing _ including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to invade <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983 and overthrow a leftist government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had hinted at military action earlier in the week, when he told interviewers, `` I think a president, all presidents, have options, but they do n't discuss what they might be.'' First <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have been trying to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since 1988, when the Panamanian leader was indicted in this country on federal drug trafficking charges The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed stiff economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in hopes of dislodging him from power. The situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been jumpy for days. Tuesday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier used an unauthorized weapon when he shot a Panamanian police officer Monday. He called the incident `` very regrettable'' but said it had to be considered in the context of a deteriorating situation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said today that plans for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, carried out today in the predawn `` Operation Just Cause,'' had been in the works since before he took office last spring. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and other administration officials called the 1 a.m. EST invasion a success even though its initial attempts to capture <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had failed. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s orders, sent 7,000 paratroopers and other soldiers from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to this country to face drug-trafficking charges. Nine American servicemen were killed, 39 injured and one reported missing in the operation, which pulled together more than 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infantrymen, paratroopers, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, airmen and sailors. `` I think this operation was a success already because we cut off the head of that government and there is a new government that was elected by the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, waiting, willing and ready to take over,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. He added that he believed the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will rally to support the new leaders installed under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auspices. `` We have not located the general. But as a practical matter, he is a fugitive and will be treated as such,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told reporters at the Pentagon. `` This reign of terror is over.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, `` The order went out late on Sunday to implement a plan that had been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I was briefed on when I became secretary of defense last spring.'' `` We hope to be wrapping up General <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> in the future,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` As the president has said, we have achieved the bulk of our objective.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the nation's top military officer, said sporadic sniping continued from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s former headquarters and that there was `` a slight problem'' near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> where the Panamanian 5th Infantry was located. Most of the remaining action consisted of putting down the remaining forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We're into mopping up and chasing down those ... who have not yet decided to give it up,'' the general said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were determining whether the firing was coming from `` an armed resistance force, or just individuals, who are now just criminals and thugs running around the countryside.'' In a nationally broadcast address from the White House shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had ordered the invasion to protect American lives and install an elected government in place of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who faces drug-trafficking indictments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said 7,000 troops had been sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> overnight to augment the 13,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and that 2,500 more were arriving later in the day. Some forces parachuted into action. The general said the invasion, dubbed `` Operation Just Cause,'' simultaneously used airborne <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, paratroopers, infantrymen, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and light tank units to attack the central headquarters of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, as well as several other military bases and airports. The bulk of the forces came from the 82nd Airborne Division from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the 7th Light Infantry Division from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. They were transported in south by huge <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 transport planes, which had been landing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> throughout the night. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces encountered opposition from local forces `` throughout the area of operations,'' but that the invasion went smoothly. `` I hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was and how competently it was carried out,'' he told reporters. Asked whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would become a fugitive leader of rebellious troops that would harass <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said: `` He can do that, and we will chase him and we will find him. He is a very canny individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to survive catastrophe, and we'll see over time whether he survives this catastrophe. `` It's been some years since General _ <LOCATION> Mister </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the fugitive, has been seen in the jungle. He's used to a different kind of lifestyle. I'm not quite sure he would be up to being chased around the countryside by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and light infantry units,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The general said the American deaths came `` as a result of firefighting,'' but could offer no further detail. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` deeply regret the loss of American life.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he did not have a reliable number for the number of Panamanian troops killed in the overnight invasion. He said that in addition to the American casualties, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo planes and helicopters were damaged. The general said there had been reports that some American civilians had been taken hostage and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were looking into each incident, but that he had `` no numbers or details to provide'' about them. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> detailed the parachute drops and assaults that resulted in American forces occupying `` all the bases'' that had been manned by the Panamanian military. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> met with reporters after a night-long vigil in the Pentagon.

 A woman who says she was forced to go outside her office to speak Spanish has filed a discrimination suit, charging her former employer's English-only policy insulted Hispanic employees. <PERSON> Ivette </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a former probation counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, contended she was forced to resign in 1986 for failure to abide by a ban on speaking of Spanish during breaks. `` They said the only way I could speak Spanish during lunch was to go outside the building,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 34, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` I felt humiliated.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the policy caused heart palpitations and emotional distress.

 A team of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents was dispatched to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today to help American forces round up fugitives wanted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criminal charges, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, there are a number of other fugitives from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` We will round up as many people as we can who are wanted in this country on charges, many of them drug-related,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> told reporters. A team of more than 10 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents was being sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities make the arrests, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 16 associates were named in two 1988 federal drug-trafficking indictments returned by grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> is accused of making $ 10 million by shipping cocaine and marijuana from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is captured, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would try him first on the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> charges. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment, returned Feb. 4, 1988, accuses <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of receiving more than $ 4.6 million to protect cocaine shipments from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, that were shipped to this country through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Under an opinion issued last month by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces overseas have the power to arrest and detain criminal suspects The opinion, which <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said was not issued in response to preparations for a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invasion, will empower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to help round up criminal suspects such as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, meanwhile, offered a legal justification for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` believes there is a legal basis for this action being taken under <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. law.'' The attorney general met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to discuss the operation and give his legal advice, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> cited the `` inherent right of self-defense'' in Article 51 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> and the right of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to protect its citizens, military installations and institutions under Article 21 of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> also empowers the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to protect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Dec. 18 <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- Star-Telegram on military cuts: As the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> budget shrinks in response to the improving climate of superpower relations and the unravelling of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s satellite system in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, intense internecine warfare already has erupted among the different branches of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military over the available bucks. That is evidenced in the reaction of <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> planners to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> plans to trim down and tailor its forces. ... The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contends that the Army would be trespassing upon its mission and attempting to do something that the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> can do better. ... By 1995, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> personnel would be reduced from 764,000 to 630,000. About 70,000 of the 220,000 troops now stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would be brought home. More emphasis would be placed on airborne, air assault and light infantry divisions, effectively transforming the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> into a contingency force capable of being deployed worldwide. Far beit from mere civilians to decide which point of view is the more correct militarily. But it does n't take a general to figure out that the real quarrel is about how the reduced <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> pie will be sliced. Over the years, interservice rivalry has bedeviled defense budgeting. With the cutbacks that are coming, however, the separate branches may be forced to take a more comprehensive view of national security needs and learn to fit their plans into the big picture.

 Dec. 14 The Free Press, <LOCATION> Mankato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on U.S.-China relations: When it comes to diplomacy, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes in the personal touch. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared for the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit with a series of telephone calls to other world leaders, and it's generally conceded that the president's penchant for handwritten notes, phone chats and informal get-togethers has eased the frictions that are inevitable even between allies. But sometimes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> puts too much stock in such methods. Such is the case with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the envoy to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a while in the 1970s, and he believes that he and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders are personal friends. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s eagerness to overlook the bloodshed under the nose of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiao-Ping </PERSON> is pathetic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is all too eager to forget about this spring's violence in Tiananmen Square.

Acting under unfortunate aplomb, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saw a need for our country to inform <PERSON> Chna </PERSON> on the happenings of the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit. And apparently that need eclipsed the memory of June's massacre: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s move comes off as a slap in the face of the student protesters who lost their lives on June 4 and in countless executions since <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not continue to cry democratic wolf. As a nation, we support and defend democracy and human rights around the world _ in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. ... Yet our top officials also take tea with top-level Chinese officials, a move that sends a worldwide message that all is well on the Chinese-American front. The President can not undo his diplomatic lapse of reason, but <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can try to temper the negative ramifications of this visit. We can continue economic sanctions begun last June against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill that would have allowed Chinese students fearful of returning home to stay in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can keep his diplomatic officials out of Chinese conference rooms. Otherwise, what's to prevent the rest of the world, particularly as the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> cut their democratic teeth, from doubting the sincerity of our support?

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

 A new church chime that rings and plays hymns during the day frightens dogs and birds and wakes small children from their naps, says a neighborhood group that wants the electronic bells silenced. `` It's like having a grandfather clock with monster speakers put in the middle of your home without your permission,'' said <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON>, who lives two doors away. <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> said Monday the three couples who sued tried to negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> Bellshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for two months but could not reach a compromise. He said he regrets the holiday timing of the suit, but he wants the Christmas hymns and other melodies toned down. The carillon was installed in September with $ 7,700 donated by a former church member in memory of her son, said the Rev. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, pastor at <LOCATION> Bellshire </LOCATION>. The bells are played from four speakers each day until early evening. They strike the hour six times a day and play hymns three times. `` We have half a dozen people who live as close to the church as these people do, who love the carillon,'' he said. `` We could raise the volume a lot higher, but we're respecting the neighbors,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We did respect the neighbor who goes to bed early, and we quit striking the hour at 7 p.m.'' A letter filed with the lawsuit from <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a public health environmentalist, said a test in September showed the bells were louder than a typical freight train heard from a distance of 100 feet. A court hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3.

 Dec. 19 The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on personal saving habits: One discouraging aspect of the remarkable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic boom of the 1980s was the decline of personal saving among wage earners. Fortunately, that trend is slowly being reversed. As a percentage of gross national product, the personal savings rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has risen from less than 4 percent in the mid-1980s to 5.4 percent this year. But Americans still lag behind other industrialized nations in their saving habits. During the presidential campaign, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to encourage saving, and now his administration is considering a number of proposals to fulfill the pledge. They may be onto something. The proposal currently floating around the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, for inclusion in the 1991 budget, is tentatively called the Family Savings Account. It would allow people of all incomes to contribute as much as $ 5,000 a year to their account; after 10 years, the interest and dividends would be tax-exempt, although the money could be ... withdrawn. ... The plan should be attractive to policy-makers. Because exemptions would n't begin for 10 years, loss of revenues to the government would be incremental and more easily predictable. The $ 5,000 ceiling would draw more money into the savings pool than other plans, including the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which sets a $ 2,000 limit per year. And unlike IRAs, in which savings are n't released until retirement, the family accounts would allow acxcess to savings much sooner. If the plan has a fault, it's that it does n't go far enough. ... We know how <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hates to lose money. But if greater personal saving is the goal _ and it's a good one _ bolder ideas may be in order.

In the midst of the coup, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration provided limited military support for her beleaguered government. Since then questions have been raised about whether it's wise for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to strongly ally itself with <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s troubled administration. It should be noted that there is a difference between support for <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and support for democracy. The point of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid to the Aquino government is that it backs a popularly elected government in the face of an attempt to overthrow it by military force.

 Dec. 18 <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>: As Newsweek magazine once told the story, after <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s only son died, she sued his poor widow to get a ring returned Reportedly, the billionaire hotel queen also would secretly drop bread crumbs on the dining room floor of her mansion to test the efficiency of the cleaning staff. And she would fire other workers with little provocation or sympathy. Most notoriously of all, she once told an employee: `` We do n't pay taxes Only little people pay taxes.'' It's easy to see why the self-anointed hotel queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has developed into such a despised person across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she finally got what she deserved. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> to four years in prison and to 750 hours of communited their blood ties, yet spontaneously saw something else in him, calling him `` Lamb of God'' who atones for human wrongs. Although protesting his unworthiness for it, <PERSON> John </PERSON> baptized <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, who insisted on it. As he emerged dripping from the water, a heavenly glow `` like a dove'' descended on him, the account says, and a voice sounded, `` This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'' Eventually, as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' ministry began, agents of <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Herod </PERSON> <PERSON> Antipas </PERSON> seized <PERSON> John </PERSON> the Baptist, imprisoned him in a dungeon, and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the king's dancing step-daughter. Gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s attacks on Herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage, but ancient Jewish historian <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> says <PERSON> John </PERSON> also was suspected of inciting insurrection While in prison, <PERSON> John </PERSON> had begun to wonder about <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' ministry and sent followers to ask, `` Are you he who is to come or shall we look for another?'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> responded, `` Go and tell <PERSON> John </PERSON> what you hear and see; the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear ... and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.'' This hinted at possible rivalry between them, but <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> went on to extol the baptizer. While Christianity generally has minimized <PERSON> John </PERSON> as simply a forerunner of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, the record shows lingering ties between them. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s influence lasted long afterward in many places as related by the missionary-apostle <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, in his preaching, often referred to <PERSON> John </PERSON>, asking challenging questions about him to stump critics. Some contemporaries saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s successor, thinking <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was the baptizer raised from the dead. Indicating the bracketing of their work, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' apostles once asked, `` Lord, teach us to pray as <PERSON> John </PERSON> taught his disciples.'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> then recited _ under pressure of <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s example _ that famous prayer known to all Christianity as the `` Lord's prayer.'' Yet there was a poignant note as <PERSON> John </PERSON> watched his own star fading and that of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> brightening. `` He must increase, but I must decrease,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> told his followers. Yet `` this joy of mine in now full.'' Grasping the `` historical solidarity between <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' writes New Testament scholar <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION>, `` has become an essential first step toward an understanding of the mission and message of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' The baptizer, says the fourth gospel, `` was not the light, but came to bear witness to the light.''

The team had expected officials would turn down their request to anchor the balloons on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory, but the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> granted permission, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` We have the luck to experience this new epoch of peace and understanding,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Culas </PERSON>, the head of the team. `` We simply wanted to be there and bring our message with the balloons to everyone.'' It was yet another sign of relaxed rules along the once-dreaded <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION>, where dozens of souvenir-seekers continue hack away on the western side gathering souvenirs. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said they had taken into custody two Americans and a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man who had broken out seven sections of the wall, each measuring 8 feet high by more than 3 feet wide. The unidentified men apparently wanted to sell the sections as souvenirs and had loaded five of them onto a truck before they were caught, police said. Police said they were cited for theft and released.

<UNK>650,000 Strike in Belgrade to Protest Austerity Measures</UNK>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 650,000 workers staged a brief warning strike Wednesday after the Serbian republic rejected a package of reforms proposed by the country's reformist government headed by Premier <PERSON> Ante </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>. Laborers in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, which is both the national and the Serbian capital, stopped working for half an hour to protest the government's austerity measures, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Drivers, store assistants and others gathered at their workplaces to read a demand by <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> trade unions for easing new austerity measures. The unions said the strike was designed to warn the federal government to pay more attention to `` impoverished people,'' who may find their low standards of living dip even lower with the proposed reforms. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s program calls for a six-month wage freeze and creation of a convertible dinar, along with other unprecedented sweeping economic and political reforms designed to pull <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> out of its economic slump. The program, which requires approval by the legislature at its current session slated to end later Wednesday, also calls for an end to state subsidies to money-losing companies which may result in laying off of at least 150,000 workers, according to official government sources. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s officially controlled media unanimously condemned the proposed reforms. <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> <PERSON> Grujic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s vice premier, told the Serbian parliament Tuesday the program will `` drastically imperil the position of the most impoverished people in the entire country.'' All five other constituent republics, however, gave green light to <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s proposed reforms and plans for political pluralism in the country. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is calling for short-term measures to curb inflation, such as price freezes. Such price freezes have previously succeeded in holding down consumer costs, but when the restrictions were lifted, inflation soared to record levels. A prolonged dispute between the leaderships of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s constituent republics over the country's political and economic future came to a head in November when the conservative Serbian government broke off all business and political ties with liberal <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>

 Two American news producers were seized from a hotel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today, prompting the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and White House for more protection for Americans and journalists, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> confirmed that some Americans were seized at the Marriott Hotel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and taken away as hostages. `` We will make efforts to take care of that,'' he said. The networks' request came after CBS' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyersohn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> were seized by rifle-carrying men said to be followers of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> The two producers had been in the hotel lobby, discussing satellite transmission to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of video of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, and were about to leave when four or five heavily armed men pulled up in a truck and took them hostage, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> Adde </PERSON> said. It is n't known where they were taken, Adde and a CBS spokesman said. About 100 journalists who have been trying to cover the fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> but are unable to leave because of gun-carrying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists roaming the streets outside, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinones </PERSON> reported by phone from the hotel during a newscast today. <PERSON> Meyersohn </PERSON>, 33, is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and is a producer for the `` CBS Evening News.'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, 31, is based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and works for various ABC News broadcasts. The two are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> declined to say whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops were moving on the hotel, citing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> practice of not detailing military movements. Asked why <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had not taken steps earlier to protect Americans at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` There are 23,000 Americans down there. There are a lot of other places there, too.'' He said he had no information on the number of Americans that had been taken hostage from the hotel.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> activated a news media pool that arrived in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today alongside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops dispatched by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The pool was developed after the controversy over secrecy surrounding the 1982 American military operation in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. `` The purpose of the pool is to be there at the beginning of the operation,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. He said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> pools are usually disbanded after the first several days as other reporters arrive on the scene. Notifying and assembling the pool takes place under terms of secrecy that are unusual for the press. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> requires that pool members not tell others about their assignment. `` We ask them to tell their families that they have been called to work. That is not that unusual late at night for journalists. We ask them not to have their spouses drive them to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, but to drive themselves or find some other way of getting there,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> source. The Pentagon pool in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is made up of journalists from the following news organizations: The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News. The initial writer's report was received at midmorning Wednesday, but news organizations were still waiting for photography from the pool well after noon. News executives receive short notice when a pool is being activated and assign the staff members who provide coverage. Their material is made available to other media organizations that do not take part. Participation in the pool is rotated several times a year. News executives notified that the pool has been activated are also sworn to secrecy. The first pool was formed in April 1985, and they have been assembled on average of twice a year since then, officials said. One pool accompanied <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships escorting oil tankers through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in July 1987, but most times reporters receiving the midnight summons have watched military maneuvers. The most recent previous pool also went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, in May 1989, a 12-member group that accompanied the first extra detachment of Marines sent there in Operation Nimrod Dancer. That pool was not kept secret, because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the operation earlier in the day.

 Thee more people were killed in factional fighting in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, police said Wednesday, and a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member said <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest hospital for blacks should be declared a disaster area. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlewood </PERSON>, who represents a <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> district for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that the escalation of violence around the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> has aggravated already critical problems at King Edward VIII Hospital. She said the hospital staff is treating 20 to 30 gunshot victims a day, and patients were exposed to `` squalor, overcrowding and humiliation.'' `` The pressures on -LRB- operating -RRB- theaters and staff means that other patients requiring surgery must be bypassed, which has resulted in many unnecessary deaths,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Charlewood </PERSON> wrote. `` Patients also are dying because the intensive care unit facilities are hopelessly inadequate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Health Minister <PERSON> Rina </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON> was aware of the problems at King <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> and giving them appropriate attention. Scores of blacks have been killed in and around the Durban-area township of <LOCATION> Inanda </LOCATION> this month, one of the worst surges of violence during a three-year power struggle in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> between members of the relatively conservative Zulu organization Inkatha and supporters of militant anti-apartheid groups. About 2,500 people have been killed in the feud. The police unrest report Wednesday gave few details about the latest killings, saying one man was shot to death in the Durban-area township of <LOCATION> Molweni </LOCATION> and two killed in their home by attackers near the town of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> toured battle-scarred sections of <LOCATION> Inanda </LOCATION>. He was accompanied by <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION> and chief minister of the semi-autonomous black homeland of <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told reporters that poverty, high unemployment and `` appalling'' living conditions were a major factor behind the <LOCATION> Inanda </LOCATION> violence. But he said peace was unlikely unless `` there is a change of heart, away from hating one another.'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> says he is as firmly opposed to apartheid as more militant groups aligned to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But he opposes the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence and its advocacy of confrontational tactics such as strikes, sanctions and demonstrations.

 ` Tis the season for human folly, or, as the sign in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bus depot puts it: `` The holidays are here. PLEASE!

With that in mind, we present our nominations for the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Ebenezer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scrooge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awards </ORGANIZATION>, given just this once to those who best exemplify the seamy underside of the Christmas spirit. These are nominations only; there will be no winners. As will become appallingly obvious, everybody loses.

The heckler reportedly had shouted, `` How about giving me your mother as a present this Christmas, <PERSON> Santa </PERSON>?'' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> was arrested after attacking him, but proudly told police, `` I gave that bum what he deserved.'' _ The elderly <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, who made off with cash from a convenience store after threatening to pour hot coffee on the clerk. For Worst Treatment of a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, the nominees are: _ Either the employees, the custmers, or both, at the Capital Plaza Mall, in suburban <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, Md. A black <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> at the mall quit after complaining of harassment by co-workers who thought <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> had to be white. The mall management blamed customers, black and white, who `` expressed concerns with having a black <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>.'' The mall later issued a public apology and asked <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> to come back. _ The <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marshalltown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which fired a female <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> because she was _ you guessed it _ female. `` Parents tell children that <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> is a man, and the mall tries to get as close to that image as possible,'' mall manager <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> explained. The mall told Ms. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON>, 28-year-old <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medberry </PERSON>, that she could go to work as an elf. _ The boy from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> whose letter to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> contained a bomb threat. Either Santa brings a computer, the child wrote, or the chimney goes kaboom. For the Best or Worst Performance by a <ORGANIZATION> Grinch </ORGANIZATION>, Depending on How You Look at It, the nominees are: _ Whoever took the nativity scene from <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s front yard in <LOCATION> Pinetops </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The only thing left was the North Star, still hanging from a pine tree. `` When I saw what happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> remarked later, `` I said, ` I hope <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> does n't come to see them.''' She apparently had n't heard about the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. _ The burglar who stole more than $ 1,000 worth of toys from the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lufkin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. _ The man, described as a `` wino,'' who chopped down the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> family's live Christmas tree in front of their house in <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and sold it to an unsuspecting neighbor for $ 7. `` It's awful,'' said another neighbor, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Frias </PERSON>. `` Especially at this time of year, and to steal that kind of thing.

<HEAD>Climbing Mount Everest May Cause Brain Damage</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People who climb <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> and other lofty peaks may suffer oxygen deprivation that damages their brains and results in temporary memory trouble, according to a study. The research on 35 mountaineers found mild impairments of long-term memory as well as difficulty spelling and following simple commands. While the problems showed up on psychological tests, most were too modest to hinder the climbers' daily lives. While the research suggests the impairment eventually eases, the researchers were unsure whether it always goes away. `` When you go to extremely high altititudes, you are getting close to the threshhold of oxygen lack that can cause an impairment of brain function,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbein </PERSON>. `` It looks like most of it is transient in most people, but some are more susceptible than others.'' <PERSON> Hornbein </PERSON>, an anesthesiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, outlined the results in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. The study was based on tests administered to 34 men and one woman before and after trips to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> or Tirich Mir from 1981 to 1984. Reports of memory loss and other apparent brain damage among mountaineers first surfaced following British journeys to <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> in the 1920s and 1930s. `` There is a lot of individual variability,'' said <PERSON> Hornbein </PERSON>. `` One would expect that repeated exposure will produce greater and longer-lasting impairment. But there are probably people who can go high and not have any problem whatsoever.'' He noted that the brain has tremendous capacity to recover from injury and is probably able to compensate for most of the death of brain cells that apparently results from temporary oxygen deprivation. <PERSON> Hornbein </PERSON>, who climbed <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> in 1963, said the possibility of temporary brain damage should be kept in perspective, considering all the hazards of mountaineering. `` Most climbers would consider this a pretty trivial risk in comparison with all the others,'' he said.

However, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should not have sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers into action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> without the support and aid of other Central American nations. `` Personally, unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> or against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people or installations, I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action,'' said <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said he would support the administration until the attack aimed at unseating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was completed, and he hoped for `` as few deaths as possible to soldiers.'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., issued a harshly critical statement, calling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action `` a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy that continues our mindless 100-year abuse of small Central American nations. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on the Constitution, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had violated the provision which requires <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' consent to go to war. `` There was no danger to our national security from this weak, small country, nor was the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in real peril,'' he said. And Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It seems to me that what the president is doing is trying to correct for his failure to back up the insurgent forces in the Panamanian Defense Forces back in October. And I think he was wrong on both occasions. He did n't provide sufficient support last time and he's doing overkill this time.'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the action `` an overwhelming success because democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` The canal is safe, Americans are safe,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said, adding that the operation was `` a very important moment in the presidency of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It is a time when the president asserted his own leadership and did so effectively.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision and praised the action as a `` blow against the international drug trade. `` We need to see how it plays out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in a telephone interview with the AP. `` I would guess there would be widespread bipartisan support for the president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to apprehend <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial on drug-smuggling charges, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The move also was intended to protect American lives as well as the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, he said. `` I think the president has done the right thing and I suspect he'll have pretty widespread support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash., said in an interview with Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> KIRO-TV </ORGANIZATION> White House officials said top congressional leaders had been briefed on the mission to seize <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by force. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, also was briefed about the operation He said on `` CBS This Morning'' that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had talked to `` are standing by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on this decision.'' <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his followers `` simply lawless bandits who broke up a free election and are ruling as nothing more or less than a drug cartel, and have constantly escalated their provocations against Americans and the security of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- Canal.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` a murderous thug'' who should be brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for drug-smuggling <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on narcotics smuggling charges by grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was requested to intervene with armed force by the duly elected president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, President -LRB- <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, whose administration was denied from taking office by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s thugs after being elected,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in a statement his office delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bureau <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and other elected <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> officials Dec. 10 and `` they were in effect pleading with us to do something'' about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Study Calls For Greater Teaching of Non-European Languages</HEAD>

 Although Japanese is the most rapidly growing foreign language course on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> college campuses, a major national program is needed to offer non-European languages to more students, said a study released Wednesday. The study, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> foreign language specialist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, said traditional West European languages are still the heavy favorites among university students. The study showed 20.4 percent of college students were studying Spanish, 16.8 percent French and 7.1 percent German in 1986 at 13 institutions surveyed. Italian was the choice of 2.4 percent and Russian the choice of 1.8 percent of university students surveyed. Japanese was picked by 2.2 percent of the students at 11 universities that offered it but `` has tripled in the last three or four years,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I was surprised by the spread of the less commonly studied languages, particularly Japanese, Chinese, Russian and a little bit of Arabic,'' he said. Mandarin Chinese was being studied by 2.1 percent of students at 10 universities. Arabic was the choice of one-half of one percent of the students at five universities offering it. `` While you still get the bulk of students coming in and continuing in French, German and Spanish, you are getting some diffusion in the colleges, and in high schools,'' he said. `` Maybe 300 high schools teach Japanese and more teach <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and Chinese.'' One of the problems, <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> said, is that students `` take language in the 9th and 10th grades and then it goes fallow in the 11th and 12th grades and is not built upon at the college level.'' `` You have got a lot of students getting a little bit of language,'' he said. `` What is clearly needed for collegiate level foreign language teaching is a major national effort dedicated to introducing major change and upgrading the system.'' Federal funds for foreign language instruction, he said, go almost exclusively for programs to teach <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel and other government employes. `` It is high time the nation invested the necessary private and public resources needed to advance foreign language instruction at the collegiate level,'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> wrote in the study. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> is a cluster of educational organizations and institutions. The study was funded by grants from the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the Pew Charitable Trusts.

<TEXT>
 Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> today blamed `` fascist, reactionary groups'' for anti-government protests in his country and confirmed that the army had to intervene to restore order. In a 25-minute address on national radio and television hours after he returned from a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> made no mention of casualties in the west Romanian city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. Witnesses coming out of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have suggested that hundreds of people were killed when security forces opened fire on anti-government protesters on Sunday. Reports today suggested the unrest had spread to other cities. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said the army had to restore order in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> after unrest was provoked by `` fascist, reactionary groups who wanted to destroy the independence and to stop the construction of socialism in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' The address, monitored by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, did not say what steps would be taken to prevent continuing unrest. Troops and police were reported patrolling <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and other Romanian cities today in an apparent attempt by the hard-line Communist authorities to stamp out any further protest. About 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets today in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, 30 miles from the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders, the Yugoslav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> quoting the Yugoslav Consul in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. Demonstrators reportedly passed the Yugoslav Consulate, chanting slogans against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. The group passed Romanian army tanks, but soldiers watched without intervening, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> report said. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> did not mention that reported protest, or unrest said by Romanian emigres and other sources to have spread to other cities in the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has been in power 24 years and is the longest-serving Soviet-bloc leader, refuses to adopt democratic reforms sweeping the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. He has forced hardships and rationing on his 23 million citizens, who have become increasingly dissatisfied with his harsh rule as the once-rigid nations around them adopt reforms. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted unofficial sources in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> as saying that `` a state of full alert has been introduced across <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as protests and unrest continue in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and other towns.'' Witnesses have reported hundreds died during the recent unrest, but an Austrian traveler, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who returned from <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> today said the death toll in anti-government demonstrations was `` more than 1,000.'' `` Sunday was brutal'' as security personnel fired into crowds of civilians in the city, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, a city of 350,000, is in ruins, he told Austrian radio. Late Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified witnesses as saying up to 2,000 people may have been killed when security forces shot into the crowd protesting the rigid policies of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s Communist government. <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Munteanu </PERSON>, a member of the Soviet Parliament from the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, said he spoke with acquaintances in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> today and was told pro-democracy demonstrations were going on in many cities. In <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION>, people were burning books by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Munteanu </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION> is an industrial and university center 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the capital. It is near the border with <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. There also have been unconfirmed reports of clashes in the cities of <LOCATION> Arad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, Ploiesti, and <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> was inaccessible to foreign travelers and telephone callers today, according to Hungarians who tried to telephone and Yugoslav border guards. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> that foreign reporters who tried to reach the town were turned back. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> today after overseeing relief shipments from <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, told Austrian radio that houses in the city center were on fire. `` Tanks were everywhere,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said in the interview. A Yugoslav trucker who speaks Romanian said he saw graffiti on walls while driving in a <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> suburb that called for `` an uprising by Romanians against the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> regime on Dec. 24.'' The trucker, who demanded anonymity, said he heard gunfire and saw the sky being lit from the direction of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> as he drove near the city today. A Hungarian radio reporter meeting people arriving from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> today said the Romanian army has been mobilized and that on Tuesday night reservists were called in. In <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, a spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that `` there is an increasing police and military presence in the streets of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. The streets are calm and quiet.'' A Hungarian who called <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and four other major <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> cities from <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> today said he was told of a heavy military and police presence in the streets. Guards at factories and offices have been doubled, according to his informants and a brief report from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The Hungarian reported that in <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, helicopters were patrolling overhead in addition to the increased security in the streets. <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> was the scene of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s last major anti-government demonstration, in November 19to discuss the operation and give his legal advice, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> cited the `` inherent right of self-defense'' in Article 51 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> and the right of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to protect its citizens, military installations and institutions under Article 21 of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> also empowers the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` to protect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The spokesman said that `` the democratically elected government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was consulted prior to and welcomed the action taken by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The evangelist who introduced <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, leading to the scandal that destroyed the television ministry, was released on $ 25,000 bond Wednesday on federal perjury charges. In his first court appearance on the charges, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> appeared without a lawyer before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who imposed several conditions for his release, including surrendering his passport and refraining from the use of alcohol. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> recently was arrested in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> on a charge of driving while intoxicated. According to the Dec. 5 indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> denied during testimony before the grand jury that indicted <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three associates that he took Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hotel to have sex with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. At a later appearance, <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told the same grand jury that he agreed when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told him: `` Get me a woman.'' In a separate hearing, the Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> minister, was released on the same unsecured bond. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is accused of lying to the special grand jury about a $ 10,000 loan he made to former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> that later went to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. The payment to Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the former church secretary received $ 265,000 in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money in exchange for her silence about her 1980 sexual liaison with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Disclosure of the payment eventually brought down the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> evanglism empire built by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who is now in federal prison after being convicted in October of fraud and conspiracy charges. `` I feel very confident,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said as he left the courthouse. `` This has been a very unfortunate experience.'' Asked if he would plead innocent, he responded: `` Absolutely.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> agreed to appoint counsel for <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> after the evangelist told the magistrate: `` I have nothing, sir, except the clothes on my back.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said later that <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, who filed for bankruptcy court protection in 1987, had signed an affidavit saying he could not afford an attorney. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> faces five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for each of 12 perjury counts. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> could face the same sentence on one perjury count. No arraignment was scheduled for <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> scheduled a Jan. 16 arraignment for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under a price subsidy program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. F. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said seven private exporting companies made the deals for a total of 410,000 metric tons under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for February and March, he said. The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 5. A previous allocation of 2 million tons made Feb. 27 had been exhausted, except for 10,000 tons. With the latest <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> approvals, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has 600,000 tons remaining to be used under the current authorization. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The latest sales would be about 15 million bushels. At current prices estimated by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3.85 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of about $ 58 million. Under EEP arrangements, private exporters may sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said the latest subsidies averaged $ 19.26 per ton, or about 52 cents per bushel. The subsidized sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 125,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 80,000; <ORGANIZATION> Coprostates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000; <ORGANIZATION> Peavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 35,000. With the latest sales, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought about 5.1 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> bought more than 8 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat, all of it under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program.

 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today and placed its army on alert, while <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> ordered its ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> until all American troops are withdrawn. Other Latin American nations expressed concern over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention, and seven of them, including <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, agreed to hold an emergency meeting in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to discuss the crisis. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> called for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the attack, and the world body was considering that request today. Foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> planned to meet in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> tonight to discuss the developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and issue a declaration, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was part of the so-called Latin American Group of Eight but was excluded after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February 1988. The group usually represents <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s stands on economic and political matters. Presidents of the seven countries were in telephone consultation over the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and decided to hold the meeting in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, a Colombian spokesman said. The group has condemned <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, but it has also consistently rejected any direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action and said he was ordering <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to return home pending a withdrawal of all American troops from <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> territory. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, reading a prepared statement at the Government Palace in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, also said the drug summit Feb. 15 with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> should be postponed as a result of events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which has long opposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack but recognized that the action was necessary. In a communique issued in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> blamed a `` lack of an effective and firm response by our countries to the violation of human rights and constitutional norms on the part of the de facto government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention. But <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> also called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to retire before it would recognize the new government of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was elected president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in May in a vote that was not recognized by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> forces. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> spearheaded attempts in the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to issue strong condemnations of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime in an effort to pressure him into leaving power. But Latin American nations showed strong revulsion to what they saw as intervention in the internal affairs of a member country. While condemning the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dictatorship's abuses, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> added that it lamented that `` traditional principles of non-intervention ... have given way to this intervention that today must be condemned and rejected.'' <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> called for the immediate meeting of an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> consulting committee to `` analyze and take decisions that will contribute to the re-establishment of Panamanian sovereignty.'' In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, Argentine Foreign Minister <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavallo </PERSON> expressed concern today and said the Group of Eight countries will seek a way of `` acting together'' to end the conflict. <PERSON> Cavallo </PERSON> told reporters that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke by telephone with President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> early today `` to explain the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> position.'' `` There is a situation of heavy confrontation between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Panamanian troops as well as armed civilians who are acting in coordination with the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces,'' <PERSON> Cavallo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said, `` is going to have to play a fundamental role to prevent a deepening of the crisis and a greater spilling of blood.'' In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Orgega </PERSON> declared a `` state of national alert'' and sent messages to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Non-Aligned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> saying he was `` deeply concerned by the invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it is a threat to the peace and security of all <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and especially constitutes a serious threat to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a communique read on <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio. The army was put on a `` state of combative general alert.'' The communique said that implied immediate deployment of land, sea and air combat units. Reserves and civilian militia also were called up. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports the rebels seeking to oust the leftist Sandinista government.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Wednesday joined the condemnation of brutal repression of protesters in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, and prominent Britons demanded that hard-line President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> be stripped of a knighthood that was bestowed on him. `` With deep pain we have all heard the news of dead and wounded in some Romanian cities,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. His comment on the violence, in which up thousands may have been killed, came at the end of his regular weekly audience. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said he was praying that human rights and religious liberty would prevail in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, which is controlled by the last Stalinist regime in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for 24 years, was given the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the highest honor for a foreign leader, during a state visit in June 1978. Lord <PERSON> Bethell </PERSON>, vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights subcommittee, said `` the Order of the Bloodbath would have been more appropriate.'' In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and affiliated organizations expressed shock at the crackdown and said it revealed the `` ruthlessness'' of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s leadership. `` It is with shock and deep sorrow that we have learned of the tragedy in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> where violent repression by the armed forces took the lives of many people,'' a statement said. Most of the violence, which began last weekend, has occurred in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, a city in western <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, where the Communist leadership was equally rigid until last month, several thousand people gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, shouting `` <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is a shame for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>!'' `` Fascists!'' and `` Murderers!'' The embassy refused to accept a protest letter. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the rally, urged <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to `` dissolve all treaties'' with the Romanian regime and recall the Bulgarian ambassador. The two nations are allies in the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> made his feelings clear during his annual Christmas meeting with diplomats, telling the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON>: `` I was hoping this meeting would take place in a different atmosphere. We are very saddened and worried ... about what is happening in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the 16 nations of the Western alliance expressed `` their dismay at the serious loss of life.'' `` The government's use of massive brutal force to suppress these demonstrations illustrates that the Romanian regime does not rule with the consent of the people,'' he said. At the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Wednesday, Romanian representatives were isolated. Delegates condemned the killing, but the Romanians managed to prevent the observance of a minute of silence. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, as host, declared to the conference that `` the Romanian regime of murderers will be unable to stay in power.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukovich </PERSON>, leader of the Austrian delegation, said all delegations condemned the events in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, but that the Soviet condemnation was restrained. The Soviets urged their Romanian allies to heed the human rights provisions of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreements on European security and cooperation, he said. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership decided to `` stop concrete cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party for the time being.'' A statement from the party presidency held the Romanian party responsible `` for last weekend's tragic events and their consequences,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported, and an invitation to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to send a delegation to the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> party congress scheduled for January was withdrawn. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> gave a note to Romanian Ambassador Traian Pop that condemned `` the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators.'' Legislators observed a minute of silence for the victims and voted to drape the parliament building in black. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s parliament condemned the crackdown and said the government in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> should `` draw the necessary conclusions'' from the events. There was no elaboration. The Foreign Ministry in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, where the beating of protesters started an uprising that ended the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> power monopoly in less than a month, protesting the use of force on demonstrators. Czechoslovak air controllers have urged an international boycott of Romanian plans. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ionesco </PERSON>, the celebrated Romanian-born playwright, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should help arrange the downfall of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Ionesco </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` alone can do something, because <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is literally colonized by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper reported.

<TEXT>
 Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war on various federal appeals courts are being examined for possible links to mail bombings that killed a judge and a civil rights lawyer, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said today. The letters may be an important clue in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of the parcel bombs that killed Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> 11th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, alderman and civil rights lawyer, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` We are examining those letters to try to determine whether or not there is a link between those threats in August and the matters at hand today,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. One letter declaring war on the 11th Circuit was received Aug. 24 by <ORGANIZATION> WAPT-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, the station reported Tuesday night. Similar letters were received that month in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that made threatening statements against other federal appellate circuit courts, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday that the investigation is focusing on the possibility that race motivated the killings and the sending of similar package bombs to the 11th Circuit and the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> ruled in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 15 in a school desegregation case The letter received in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bore an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmark dated Aug. 21, the day before a tear-gas cannister exploded in that city's <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> office, injuring eight people. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> declined to describe the postmarks on the other letters, except to say they were sent in late August. All four letters were examined by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but yielded no further physical clues, such as fingerprints, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshals in the various jurisdictions were told of the threatening letters, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The letter attacking the 11th Circuit threatened poison gas attacks on large cities to force the court to `` adopt fair and impartial treatment of all.'' Entitled `` Declaration of War,'' the letter said the 11th Circuit `` does deliberately and wrongfully refuse to fulfill its obligation to protect the innocent.'' `` The court's failure to render impartial and equitable judgments is due to rank bias and the mistaken belief its victims can not effectively retaliate,'' the letter said. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> television station said it immediately turned the letter over to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Three weeks after the letter surfaced, the 11th Circuit published <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s opinion for the unanimous three-judge panel in the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> school case. It reversed a lower-court ruling that <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> schools could stop busing to achieve racial integration. On Saturday, <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was killed in his <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, home after opening a parcel mailed to him. On Monday, a similar bomb was found at the 11th Circuit courthouse in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and removed without incident. Hours later, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was fatally injured in his <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> law office when he opened the parcel mailed to him. On Tuesday, authorities found a similar bomb at the office of the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the school case. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday he would not be surprised if the <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> murder was related to cases he had worked on as a federal appellate judge. Sessions said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s court docket would be carefully studied to determine if his rulings may have sparked a racially motivated murder. Sessions implied that the bureau did not have a suspect, and indicated there might be more than one perpetrator. `` As far as I know there's been no claimant of responsibility at all,'' Sessions said at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Sessions said investigators found no similarities between the bomb incidents and the actions of extremist white groups but `` it is something you can not rule out.'' `` We would hope the patterns of these types of groups when studied carefully and compared will yield fruit,'' Sessions said. Asked about racial motivation, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said: `` When the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters receives a suspicious package, an alderman is killed, you have to have that in the back of your mind.'' The package containing the bomb that killed <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> bore the return address of another 11th Circuit judge, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a government source said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who had previously sent packages to <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, is not a suspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was familiar with the two judges' friendship, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called the incidents `` an affront to our nation's commitment to the rule of law'' and said he had assured civil rights leaders the case would be thoroughly investigated

 Ten years ago, guerrilla chieftain <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> put pen to paper in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to end a bloody seven-year war for control of his homeland, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s last colonial outpost in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>. That all-party peace pact signed on Dec. 21, 1979, silenced the guns and led to the birth of black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> four months later. A decade later, as president of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> is on the receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels based in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> was able to lead <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to peace as <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> through talks, he is opposed to similar direct negotiations with the insurgents, who have threatened to bring their war into <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> seeks to undermine <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>'s socialist government. The 12-year-old war has left an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 dead and created about 1 million Mozambican refugees. Almost half of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 15 million people require some food aid. The guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital to landlocked <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s economy, and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> has stationed 12,000 troops in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> at a crippling cost of $ 450,000 a day. <PERSON> Dhlakama </PERSON>'s rebels now routinely cross the scrub-studded plains and pine-carpeted mountains into <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to raid tea and coffee plantations, native villages and state schools. Hundreds of Zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in these forays, and tens of thousands have been herded into state-guarded villages, upsetting life all along the 800-mile frontier. `` The Rhodesians forced many people into so-called protected villages when they were fighting <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s guerrillas,'' said a Roman Catholic missionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` So there are villagers today who are suspicious that they're being placed in similar settlements by the government they support. But missionaries back the government's contention that Zimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because of the rebels. The guerrillas, known also by their <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>, have been accused of widespread atrocities, including the killing of children, mutilating of victims, rape, and destruction of entire communities. The rebels were founded in 1977 by former Rhodesian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to hound <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s guerrillas in their Mozambican bases. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> ended aid for <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> when he came to power and no government currently acknowledges assistance. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and Kenyan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> have been acting as intermediaries in indirect talks in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> between the rebels and the <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> government. There have been no breakthroughs since the talks began in July. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks for <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, insisting <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> disavow violence and lay down its arms first. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, demands <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> before face-to-face negotiations can be considered. <ORGANIZATION> Renamo </ORGANIZATION> also demands that <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s government allow it to take part in elections as a legal party. The Mozambican government says it will not accept a second party but is considering a proposal that would allow people who are not in the ruling party to run for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Here is a summary of the two <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties signed in September 1977 by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and Panamanian leader <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONTROL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will administer the canal jointly until the expiration of the treaty on Dec. 31, 1999. At that time, control, management and maintenance of the canal go to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president was to appoint a Panamanian nominated by his government as administrator to take charge of the canal on Jan. 1, 1990. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to recognize the government of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and has spurned his choice for the post. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Dec. 5 he asked the canal's deputy administrator, Panamanian <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON>, to take over as acting administrator <PERSON> Manfedo </PERSON> accepted.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 For the duration of the treaty the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has primary responsibility for the defense of the canal. A board of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian military officers was established to consult on defense matters and every five years reviews military resources made available by both countries. During the life of the treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decides on its own how and when to reduce its forces in the Canal Zone and schedule the closing of its bases.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>COMPENSATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pays <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> $ 50 million to $ 60 million from canal revenue and an additional $ 10 million a year for the canal's operation <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also received $ 50 million in military assistance over a 10-year period.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LANDS AND WATERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 About 70 percent of the 500-square-mile Canal Zone reverted to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after the treaty was ratified. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retained temporary control over the rest, including areas considered vital to running the canal.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JURISDICTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Three years after ratification, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> civilian employees in the <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> became subject to Panamanian law instead of American law. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> took responsibility for public and social services, including schools, the Canal Zone police force, and postal service.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEUTRALITY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Under a separate treaty, the two countries agreed to a guarantee that the canal would remain open to ships of all nations and that the canal's neutrality would be respected `` in times of war as in times of peace.'' American and Panamanian warships and other vessels were given priority to use the canal.

<HEAD>Economy Continues Growth Amid Fears It's Running Out of Steam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than previously estimated, the government said Wednesday, but analysts say it is fast running out of steam and some suggest it is flirting with a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the July-September period, up from a 2.5 percent rate reported in October and the subsequent revision to 2.7 percent last month. However, analysts said the economic growth in the third quarter borrowed its strength from the current quarter, when many see a growth rate of less than 1 percent and possibly an end to the unprecedented seven years of peacetime expansion. The administration is forecasting a 2.7 percent growth rate for all of 1989, and the fourth-quarter GNP would have to advance 1.6 percent to meet that goal. The GNP grew by 3.7 percent in the first quarter and 2.5 percent in the second. `` The bottom line is that we borrowed from the future to produce 3 percent growth and that source of strength is gone now,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> and others said much of the third-quarter growth resulted from robust earlier-than-normal sales of automobiles and light trucks in the third quarter that were driven by incentives But the incentives were dropped with the introduction of higher-priced 1990 models in October and sales immediately slumped. Only this month have automakers begun to restore rebates and lower interest rates that chief economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said could boost sales early next year. Many analysts had suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would have to ease credit further to stimulate the economy and the central bank late Tuesday added money to the banking system in a signal that it might lower interest rates. As a result, the key federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, dropped to 8 7-16 percent from about 8 -LCB- percent late Tuesday. Analysts said they expected a target of 8 \ percent for the rate, the first drop since late November <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, forecast fourth-quarter growth of 1 percent with continued weakness in the first quarter of 1990. `` I think a lot will depend on monetary policy,'' <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> continues to drag its heels, it could continue to get weakness and could turn this into a recession.'' But even with further easing by the central bank, <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> said he expects a `` somewhat lackluster first quarter'' returning to 2 percent to 2.5 percent growth later in the year. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, on the other hands, says that while economic data does not support his view, `` I think we're in some sort of recession'' now. The sluggish fourth-quarter growth is a result of <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> efforts to contain inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit. Inflation appeared to begin moderating earlier this year and since June the central bank has eased some short-term interest rates. Its policy-making arm, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, met secretly Monday and Tuesday, but as usual, gave no indication of any decisions. The GNP report contained favorable inflation news, however. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, unchanged from earlier estimates but down from the 5 percent jump in the April-June quarter. The revision in the latest report was due in large part to new data that showed exports rose 3.9 percent, rather than 1.6 percent as reported earlier. At the same time, imports fell from a 9.5 percent gain first reported to 7.4 percent in the latest report. Consumer spending, however, dropped to a 5.6 percent increase rather than the 6.2 percent advance reported last month. Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Business capital spending posted a 5.2 percent gain, compared with 4.6 percent in last month's report, possibly reflecting an improvement in the decline of corporate profits.

 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today they were pressing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to ensure the safety of guests at a luxury hotel in downtown <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after several people were taken from the building by Panamanian troops. The 400-room <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, which employs 300 people, was about 42 perce Tuesday when Panamanian military troops came to the facility, according to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>, a spokesman for Betent occupied lathesda, Md.-based <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. Although <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said details were sketchy, it was his understanding that `` Panamanian military forces had come into our hotel and seized an undetermined amount of people.'' He said a handful of journalists, as well as several employees, were taken from the hotel early this morning by Panamanian troops. The remainder of the guests were accommodated in the hotel ballroom, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were aware of hostages taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and that some Americans were still at liberty in the building. `` We will make efforts to take care of that,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. But he declined to say whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops were moving guests in a situation that was `` just like when an earthquake hits ... Everyone makes do.'' `` Operations are not normal,'' he said, but he did not think the hotel guests were under guard by Panamanian military officials. The hotel's general manager, <PERSON> Sapinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Palta </PERSON>, was at a meeting in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, today but had been in touch with the hotel by telephone, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. Other hotel officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> Hotels President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiesel </PERSON>, were trying to get through to the hotel, but having little success, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. But the hotel officials had been in touch with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` From <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>'s standpoint, we are taking every effort to have the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military troops secure the hotel so that guests can be protected,'' he said. The hotel, the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caesar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Aoki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese company, but it is managed by <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. Opened in 1982, the hotel is adjacent to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlapa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> five minutes from the banking center of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. At the time of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, most of the guests were journalists and airline crews, <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. There were few businessmen in the hotel, he said.

<HEAD>Boys Protest Exploding Rocket Booster Toy as `Sick Humor'</HEAD>

 Four young brothers, upset by a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Christmas catalog toy that features an exploding rocket booster, have taken on the giant retailer and apparently won `` Sabotage the rocket booster'' is how the holiday Wishbook promotes an exploding toy rocket, part of a series called Building Blasters. Angry over the association with the fatal January 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, the Sanders boys fired off letters in September to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> executives and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We feel this is very sick humor,'' wrote <PERSON> Jared </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Seth </PERSON>, 9. `` We do n't want children learning to blow up space shuttles! There are plenty of terrorists in the world already.'' Younger brothers <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 5, and <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, 3, also signed the letters. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> customer relations official in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, recently wrote the boys: `` Your concern is valid. I doubt that this product will be offered in future catalogs.'' The catalog, distributed over the summer, invited customers to build a rocket pad and `` detonate'' the accompanying rocket upon launch. `` It's pretty disgusting, from both a parent and a schoolteacher point of view,'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s backup teacher in space, said Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, of <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, witnessed the Challenger explosion that killed all seven astronauts aboard, including <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> teacher <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Funkhouser </PERSON>, a public services division director in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, said he wrote a letter of complaint to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> a week ago after learning of the Sanders' protest but has not received a response. The boys' mother said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' reply to her sons was not enough. `` There's no guarantee the toys are going to be off their shelves,'' <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said Tuesday. However, the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Kenner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said manufacturing and shipping of the toy have been discontinued due to poor sales. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohach </PERSON>, vice president of advertising and marketing services at <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters, said the company had no intention of equating the toy with the Challenger. He said the company found that `` kids like to build things and like to knock them down.'' The Building Blasters series includes an oil rig, a fuel depot, a suspension bridge and a communications tower. In her letter to the Sanders boys, Ms. <PERSON> Guttke </PERSON> said the possibility of encouraging terrorism never surfaced while the toy was being child-tested. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>'s Bohach both said the Sanders children's complaint was the only one they had heard.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> early today left many civilians dead in the streets and touched off a fire that leveled a slum area around a Panamanian Defense Forces stronghold, witnesses said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in helicopters warned townspeople in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s capital of the impending attack, assuring them by loudspeaker that the soldiers `` did n't have a problem with the government,'' said one witness The witnesses spoke to reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> by telephone. `` They burned everything down,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Backalt </PERSON> said in an interview from a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office near the Defense Forces headquarters where he fled with his wife and three children. `` I see plenty people dead in the street.'' He said the bodies _ he did not know how many _ were mainly members of the dignity battalions, civilian paramilitary groups loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 32, who also took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office, said there were warnings in the night of the coming attack. `` Before they started to bomb, they warned -LRB- those in the area of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces headquarters -RRB- to come out,'' he said. `` They were shouting down over the <ORGANIZATION> PA </ORGANIZATION> system saying ... they did n't have a problem with the government. At that point residents of the slum area surrounding the headquarters, a section of mostly wooden homes, headed into the streets, he said. `` They came out when they heard the announcement, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soliders led them to a neighborhood church,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. He said the American soldiers moved in as he was heading to the church. During the attack a fire began, destroying the area, he said. Backalt, a self-employed stove repairman, said he was sleeping when he heard gunfire. He said his house caught fire, and he and his family went out into the street. None of his family was injured. As they walked the streets, he said, they saw a helicopter crash. He said he did n't know if it was an American or Panamanian helicopter. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiltshire </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office, said <PERSON> Backalt </PERSON> was one of about 40 people near the office who were looking for assistance. He said it would be difficult to care for those displaced and injured in the attack. `` They want a place to stay because they are all burnt out. It's mounting up,'' he said <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION> said pro-Noriega forces were commandeering cars throughout the morning from people driving during the attack. `` They say, ` We're the police. We need your car,''' he said. His wife, <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON>, said they saw several families scurrying about with their possessions. `` They were carrying TVs and their belongings on their heads,'' she said. `` We're just about to get some meals cooked so we can service them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office is about two miles from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> base, and is near the headquarters of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces. <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION>'s daughter, <PERSON> Avonnie </PERSON>, said she was awakened by the sound of shooting. `` I thought it was firecrackers. We realized after that it was a lot of gunfire,'' she said. `` We tried to stay away from the windows and doors.'' The <PERSON> Wiltshires </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> radio station broadcast warnings throughout the early morning, advising people stay indoors.

 Ice-covered roads made the bus ride after school a harrowing experience, but one man's hospitality made everything turn out right. Six students attending Little Rock schools never reached home Monday night. Instead, they spent a snug night at the home of their bus driver. `` What else could I have done?'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>, 58, said Tuesday. `` The bus is family. We're a small group and we're together a lot during the day, so we're family.'' `` I'm proud that we have a man who confirmed to the kids that he would put them up and see to their well-being,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, an assistant supervisor with the <ORGANIZATION> Pulaski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said the slow journey on the bus included a three-hour traffic jam on highways, waiting in vain for traffic to clear during an hour-long stay at one student's house, losing traction between two hills being towed a half-mile backward by <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> firefighters, and narrowly missing a man standing in the road. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterman </PERSON>, 15, said <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> told them to keep their seat belts on and talk to their friends to take their mind off the road.

There, <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said, he and his wife <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> fed them hot dogs and pizzas and put them to bed _ three girls in the couple's own bed and three boys in beds formerly used by the couple's grown children. <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON> said he and his wife slept on a fold-out couch in their living room. `` He's a hero,'' said <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>. `` He got us out of the mess and kept everyone calm.''

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> weighs too much, probably has high cholesterol, eats too many cookies on Christmas Eve and should exercise more than once a year, but health experts are impressed by his longevity. As far as physicians can determine, <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> is about 1,700 years old. `` He must be doing something right to have lived this long,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a dietician at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Margaret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said.

 Then as now, the invasion was launched in the pre-dawn hours. Then as now, the declared goal was to protect American citizens. But the similarities between the American landing on the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> on Oct. 25, 1983 _ the last time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were sent on an invasion _ and Wednesday's <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are mostly superficial. Both were described as pre-emptive operations, but logistically and strategically they are largely different. The invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, spearheaded by 1,900 Marines and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, was undertaken with the stated purpose of protecting the lives of more than 600 American medical students from a Marxist government that had taken the island's government by force Oct. 19. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, too, said he had ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect the lives of Americans, this time an estimated 35,000, many of them soldiers. The presidential statements justifying the invasions was similar. Said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1983: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' objectives are clear: to protect our own citizens, to facilitate the evacuation of those who want to leave, and to help in the restoration of democratic institutions in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday: `` The <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people want democracy, peace, and the chance for a better life in dignity and freedom. The people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals.'' In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were under orders to capture <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's ruler who is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. While both presidents said they were acting to restore democratic governments, the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> operation had broader regional implications. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had grown increasingly concerned since 1981 about what he perceived as a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Soviet military buildup on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion was lent legitimacy by a request from six tiny eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help to stop the military buildup, which they believed could endanger their democratic governments. Indeed, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force was accompanied by 300 police officers and defense forces from four of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> neighbors. Although plans for both operations were long in the making _ the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion replicated a 1981 exercise _ the landing on <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> was much more of a surprise to the world. Many people did n't even know how to pronounce the name of the nutmeg-producing island and its new leader, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Coard </PERSON>, while years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clashes with the defiant and provocative <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have become almost legend. The surprise six years ago was compounded by a lack of information about the operation in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> because of a complete <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> news blackout. Reporters were given access to the island only on the fifth day. The fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was closely covered from the start by the resident news corps and, hours after the fighting began, by a pool of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reporters flown there by the Pentagon. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion was supported and prepared by some 13,000 troops already stationed at American bases there. In <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, there were no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel on hand before the invasion. `` The logistics of getting there were much harder,'' said <PERSON> Langhorne </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON>, who served as assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs at the time of the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion. The handkerchief-size <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> _ 8 by 18 miles with a population of less than 100,000 _ was a less complicated target than <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with its 30,000 square miles and population of 2.3 million. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a much messier place to operate, with Americans scattered around the country'' and a professional, U.S.-trained military, <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force _ which at the height of the invasion numbered about 7,000 _ encountered a military force of several thousand Soviet-armed troops, aided by about 600 armed Cubans there to construct a 9,500-foot airport runway that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said had no civilian use. Nineteen Americans were killed in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, several of them in accidents, as well as 24 <ORGANIZATION> Grenadans </ORGANIZATION>, most of them when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes mistakenly bombed a mental hospital. Also killed were 24 Cubans. The actual fighting for control of the island lasted about 36 hours, said <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, a diplomat who headed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> campaign to enlist public support for the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> operation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stayed about seven weeks to defend the interim government and clean up pockets of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> resistance. `` But there was no real urban warfare, unlike <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>.

So I would just like to continue that.'' The Ailey company's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> season runs until Dec. 31. It will tour in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the spring, then perform in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in June and in three cities in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in September.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops smashed the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Wednesday and installed a new government, but the military ruler who antagonized a superpower fled into hiding and his loyalists seized some Americans. More than 20,000 troops backed by warplanes began their invasion shortly after midnight Tuesday under a full moon, pounding Panamanian military installations in and around the capital with mortar, cannon and machine-gun fire. In the early afternoon, smoke rose from the shattered headquarters of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and sporadic gunfire was heard in the distance. Widespread looting broke out. In the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> neighborhood to the northeast, attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> barracks atop a hill. More than 50 bodies were counted by one hospital early in the fighting but more bodies flooded in after daybreak. Officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said nine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen were among the dead. Hundreds of people were wounded. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he ordered the invasion after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was in a state of war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and after the shooting death last week of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant. He said the attack was a mission to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for allegedly trafficking in Colombian cocaine. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in speech to the nation. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the action was ordered after the administration received unconfirmed reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> intended to attack a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residential neighborhood in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pamana </PERSON>'s national radio reported about 40 Americans had been `` detained,'' while <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> said at least 10 Americans were held hostage. Troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were seen taking at least two Americans away from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, winner of the May 7 elections that were voided by the Noriega-controlled government, was sworn in as president and given immediate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later ordered that economic and political sanctions be lifted and authorized federal drug agents to pursue arrests in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and Foreign Minsiter <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, both installed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, held a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> office in the capital and declared they still governed. `` The government controls the situation in the country and its institutions,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. `` We are prepared to resist.'' It was clear, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops controlled the capital. The huge assault by <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, infantrymen, sailors, airmen and paratroopers was the bloody pinnacle of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s long war with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a bellicose career soldier who had a strong core of support among working class people and who seemed to delight in defying the mighty <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> survived two coup attempts from within the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces that he headed, including one October insurrection in which he was briefly captured. He survived <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s best non-military efforts to oust him, including harsh economic sanctions that severely depressed the economy. There was strong evidence in the two previous coup attempts of dissatisfaction within the military with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and it was unclear how much of his support was holding after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack. In his address, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he intends to turn over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> as required under existing treaties. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the drug charges and claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cede control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> by the year 2000. At the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base outside the capital, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` may take to the hills and be very hard to find ... but he would n't have a significant force to actually do anything.'' `` We will chase him, and we will find him,'' Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that nine American servicemen were killed, 39 were wounded and one was missing. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said more than 60 Panamanians died in the fighting, and several hundred were wounded, mostly civilians. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION> area, where the fighting was heaviest, did not allow the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to enter the area. A man indentified only as Major <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> that `` 40 Americans have been detained,'' but that figure could not be confirmed. Two paramilitary Panamanian troops arrived at the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> at about 9 a.m. and took away three Americans The soldiers then asked the front desk for a list of guests and where they were staying. The desk said it did not give it to them. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were aware of hostages taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will make efforts to take care of that,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, declining to elaborate. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he did not know how many Americans were being held. Earlier in the invasion, Panamanian troops held 12 foreigners at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, including eight Americans, for about two hours.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack as `` gunboat diplomacy'' while <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> offered support. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> expressed outrage and recalled its <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ambassador. <LOCATION> Venezeula </LOCATION> summed up many reactions by saying it opposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime but condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was considering <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s request for an emergency meeting to consider the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` will demand that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdraw its invading troops immediately,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assault began about midnight Tuesday as forces attacked Panamanian military headquarters, which witnesses said was destroyed. Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> base <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from the capital. About 9,500 American troops from bases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were flown in to augment the 12,000 soldiers based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> has 15,000 men. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> also has armed citizen `` Dignity Battalions.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s main bodyguard, Lt. <PERSON> Asuncion </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON>, spoke on national radio after dawn to say that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` well and in a safe place.'' `` Do n't anyone give up your positions,'' he said. <PERSON> Gaitan </PERSON> then gave a series of messages using code names and instructions. Fighting continued after dawn in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, just east of the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, and in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, a poor district northeast of the city center. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting, said <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrellon </PERSON>. He said landslides had caused the only previous closings in the waterway's 75-year history Panamanian forces attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, causing light damage, and the area was secured by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and vehicles about 4:30 a.m., said a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity. The only TV channels operating were the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military network and a Panamanian station that displayed a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> shield. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> had shot down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with economic and political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was criticized for not ordering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to help the mutineers during the October coup attempt. American soldiers blocked some routes to Defense Forces headquarters, but not all, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists rescued him. On Friday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rubber-stamp government declared the country was in a `` state of war'' with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and named the general head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant was shot to death by Panamanians in what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials called an unprovoked attack. American troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been on maximum alert and restricted to base since the lieutenant was killed Saturday and an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> couple was held and the woman threatened sexually. On Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer wounded a Panamanian policeman because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>.

 The former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> and her two sons were behind bars today after being extradited from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> on charges of running a major marijuana smuggling ring. Less than 24 hours after their extradition, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON> appeared in shackles Tuesday before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate and were then jailed for a hearing Friday on whether to free them on bail before trial Feb. 13. `` The evidence we'll present will likely keep them detained,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> said. A 1987 indictment named them among 34 people charged with operating an 11-state ring that moved at least 250,000 pounds of marijuana _ one of the biggest such drug operations ever uncovered. They were arrested in May in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Before leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985, <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, 58, was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION> and the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of Jewish Women. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, 35, was a commodities broker and columnist for a local business journal. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbrunn </PERSON>, 38, lived with his wife and two children on a farm outside <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` This is a major milestone,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` Though we had felt confident that they would be home by the end of the year, it's good to see that process complete. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> and her staff waited for months while <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> processed hundreds of pages of documents, translated them into German and moved them through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Child-Resistant Containers Backed for Two Cosmetics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff on Wednesday recommended that the agency require child-resistant containers for two cosmetic products that pose a risk of poisoning for young children who might accidentally swallow the preparations. `` They can cause severe toxic effects in humans and pose a risk of serious injury or death to young children,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a project manager in the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical hazards program, in testimony at a commission hearing. White recommended the agency require special packaging for artificial fingernail glue removers containing acetonitrile and home permanent hair-wave neutralizers with sodium or potassium bromate. `` Child-resistant packaging is readily available ... and the costs for complying with a special packaging regulation are estimated to be low relative to the potential benefits,'' she added. The commission deferred voting on the package requirements, but <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the procedural nature of commissioners' questions indicated they would follow the staff recommendations and require the child-proof containers. Acetonitrile is used as a solvent in liquids used by manicurists to remove artificial sculptured fingernails, hobbyists in model building and as a general household glue remover. Material compiled by the agency's staff said a 16-month-old <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> boy died in 1987 after swallowing up to two tablespoons of sculptured nail remover. Three other children under the age of five also were seriously injured after ingesting similar products containing acetonitrile, the report said. Staff researchers found 17 cases _ one involving the death of a 17-month-old child and one that resulted in permanent hearing loss and kidney damage to a 16-month-old _ of accidential ingestion of bromate neutralizers since 1947. Neutralizers are used to stop the action of chemicals used in permanent hair-wave products. Preparations with sodium and potassium bromates were commonly used during the 1940s and 1950s but had virtually disappeared from the market after being replaced by products with alternative ingredients, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Recently, however, several smaller manufacturers have again begun adding the bromates to neutralizers, she said. White said it would cost manufacturers of both types of products 2 to 7 cents per package to add the containers child resistant. More than $ 5 million in glue removers are sold for cosmetic and hobby use annually, the staff materials said. Sales of permanent wave products, including those containing bromates, were put at $ 107.6 million in 1987. The staff recommendation would require that any product containing acetonitrile be in a child-resistant container. Both products are sold in supermarkets, drug stores and retail and wholesale beauty supply outlets. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had asked to commission to require the child-resistant packaging. The petition was supported by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and <ORGANIZATION> Fragrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday's hearing was the first on product safety since <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones-Smith </PERSON> became chairman of the panel last month. The commission has been without a quorum for most of 1989 and could not meet to conduct official business.

 Death rates for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients were higher in 1988 than federal projections at 3.4 percent of the nation's nearly 6,000 hospitals, the government said Wednesday Thirty-two hospitals, including six public hospitals in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, have had higher-than-projected rates for three consecutive years. Four had fewer deaths than projected during the same period, officials said. However, federal health officials cautioned that the report `` is not a direct measure of the quality of care'' and should not be used to judge hospitals as good or bad. The report said 196 hospitals, or 3.4 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals, had higher-than-expected death rates in 1988. That compares with 194 such hospitals in 1987 and 187 in 1986, according to revised figures. Data for those years were recomputed to account for different risk factors added to the calculations of the 1988 projections. At the other end of the scale, 51 hospitals, or 0.9 percent, were found to have <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> death rates lower than projected. Applying the revised calculations, such hospitals numbered 48 in 1987 and 40 in 1986. Although the statistics were based solely on admissions of Medicare patients, officials said they believe the rates are reflective of the general population. The information in the third annual report on Medicare hospital patient death rates was compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morford </PERSON>, director of the agency's health standards and quality bureau, said it would be unfair and inaccurate to label the facilities whose death rates were outside the projected ranges as the nation's best or worst hospitals. `` This is not a one-to-one measure of quality of care,'' he said. Rather, the information is intended to be one indicator of quality of care and consumers should use it to ask more informed questions when assessing a hospital's strengths and weaknesses, he said. The names of the 32 hospitals with repeatedly higher-than-expected death rates were released with the caveat that it `` does not necessarily mean that the care at these hospitals was substandard nor that these hospitals are the poorest performing acute care hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Twenty of the hospitals are public facilities, five are private non-profit hospitals, three are private for-profit and four are run by churches. The four hospitals with repeatedly lower rates included two public hospitals and two private facilities, one for-profit and one non-profit. Asked about the significance that six Puerto Rican hospitals, more than any one state, have had repeatedly higher rates, <PERSON> Morford </PERSON> said: `` At this point, I'm not drawing anything from anything. ... Obviously we are going to make some inquiries as to the care at -LRB- all 32 -RRB- hospitals.'' <PERSON> Morford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. General Hospital in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is an example of a hospital that consistently exceeded projected death rates for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients but recently improved conditions remarkably The hospital was told last year that it would no longer receive Medicare reimbursement unless improvements were made. Though the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hospital is on the list of 32, `` over the past three months they have done extraordinary things to bring themselves into compliance,'' <PERSON> Morford </PERSON> said. In comments included in the report, some hospitals took exception to the agency's projected ranges, some noted data errors and others said the ranges do n't adequately reflect that many of their patients are sicker when they arrive at the hospital and more likely to die. For some hospitals, death rates were less than 1 percentage point over the upper bound of the projected range. The financing agency, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said one of the studies it conducted using the report's data indicates that large urban hospitals and publicly owned hospitals are more likely to have quality problems and higher death rates than other hospitals. As another measure of quality, officials said a study by agency staff and researchers at the Medical Colleges of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> shows that hospitals with a larger percentage of board-certified physicians, registered nurses, higher payroll expenses and more access to high-technology facilities are more likely to have lower mortality rates. The hospital mortality report calculates the rates for all causes of Medicare deaths as well as for each of 16 diagnostic categories, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. It provides such general information as the number of beds, interns, residents and registered nurses, as well as the types of specialty services offered. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays hospital and doctor bills for about 33 million Americans who are over 65, blind or disabled.

Panamanian soldiers shot and killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer at a roadblock on Saturday night. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s declaration last week that a `` state of war'' existed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` the attacks on our citizens over the weekend are several of the things which the president has cited which required us to move in self-defense,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said. Article 51 of the Charter permits the use of `` individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, until the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said he was talking with council members and favored more consultations before any public meeting is held. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to seize <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial on drug trafficking charges. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> informed Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> of the military moves at 2 a.m. Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is `` extremely concerned'' about the crisis, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> repeatedly has come before the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to complain of allegedly provocative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers it said were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple the government. In August, <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> asked the council to send military observers to his country to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from goading confrontations as a pretext for armed intervention. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers, said <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, `` will insure that the reality of the situation can not be hidden and it will be recorded in the annals of history as a crime.'' However, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> did not have any nation on the council introduce a resolution to send observers, a necessary step toward sending a mission. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said in April and August that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to provoke confrontations in order to keep control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under a 1977 treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to turn over control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

 A group of 52 Soviet teen-agers who were exposed to radiation during the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Wednesday for a three-week holiday. The children, guests of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kibbutz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, came under an agreement on youth exchanges signed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz-Oz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this month Katz-Oz and Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> were waiting at the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> for the excited children, brought by a special Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> airlines flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We know what you have suffered and we all hope the warm sun of this country will be of benefit to you,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` What we, the older people, have lost, you the young ones can regain by bringing understanding between our two peoples.'' `` We shall pray that you should gain complete freedom, you pray for us that we should achieve complete peace, and we both shall pray for better understanding between our countries,'' he said. The Soviet children, aged 14 to 16, were also greeted by Israeli youths of their own age from five kibbutzim, or collective farms, in the southern <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert. The young guests will spend several days in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> and will also visit <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Naftali </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaniv </PERSON> said. The Soviet children are not suffering from any radiation-related diseases following the April 1986 accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, the worst ever involving a nuclear reactor. But they will be under medical observation by local doctors and some may undergo closer check-ups in Israeli hospitals. Another group of 50 children from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> area is due to arrive in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next year. The exchange program would encompass 1,000 youths aged 15 to 17 from both countries. `` This is only one of the agreements signed by Katz-Oz,'' <PERSON> Yaniv </PERSON> said. `` We hope that next week we can start to implement the second agreement, on the supply of fresh Israeli agricultural products to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> region.'' Katz-Oz, the first Israeli minister to travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in at least 22 years, was invited there by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 30 million agricultural agreement stipulates export of 90,000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> region, which consumes 2.5 million tons a year. A third party, in return, would sell Soviet goods for hard currency and transfer the money to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> following the 1967 Middle East War. The countries exchanged low-level diplomatic missions in 1987-88 and are developing cultural and economic ties.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Communists Approve Break with National Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Lithuanian Communists voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to form an independent party, breaking <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s iron political unity for the first time in Soviet history. The Lithuanian party's congress of 1,038 delegates voted to declare themselves an `` equal partner,'' rather than a subordinate, of the Soviet Communist Party. Delegates at the <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and Ballet Theater stood for a sustained ovation after the vote result was announced: 855 voted for independence, with 160 for retaining subordination to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party. Party chief <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> congratulated the congress and expressed the `` hope and wish that our party will always be resolute, rejuvinated and ready for new battles.'' The party declared in a resolution it would `` maintain relations of equal partnership with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, other progressive parties, public organizations and movements.'' `` The major goals of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are an independent, democratic <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> state, implementation of the ideals of humanistic socialism, liberty and social justice, creation of adequate living conditions for the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> people and all the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' the resolution said. The break runs counter to more than 80 years of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> practice and polcy. Since before the 1917 Russian Revolution, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> demanded a unified party covering the entire territory of the czarist empire. In 1921, the party formally outlawed the existence of factions. The vote came after two days of tough exchanges between the majority seeking a break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and the minority, mostly ethnic <PERSON> Slavs </PERSON>, who opposed it. `` I believe that the formation of this kind of independent party leads practically to its annihilation,'' said <PERSON> Stefanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Serzhantovich </PERSON>, a tractor driver from rural <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> who is a congress delegate. But <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> and other party leaders said such a split, including drafting a separate party program, was necessary for Lithuanian Communists to compete in Feb. 24 elections. The Communists, who supported a legislative move Dec. 7 to strike the leading role of the party from the Baltic republic's Constitution, will have to compete with the grassroots political movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> and other newly formed parties in the local elections President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had appealed to the Lithuanians, most recently through party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, not to split, saying doing so would hurt his reform effort. <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, a conservative member of the ruling Politburo, said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party's action `` is great trouble for the people and for the Communists.'' He said the Lithuanians `` just do not realize yet what grief will descend.'' Lithuanian party documents set a goal of restoring the republic's complete political independence, something <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has warned could upset the balance of a rapidly changing era. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s action was the latest in a series of radical steps taken by Communist parties in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which have ended their monopoly on political power and allowed other parties to form. Writer <PERSON> Raimondas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasauskas </PERSON> told the delegates that an independent <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was no danger to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` just like the existence of a peaceful <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is not bad, just like the changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> do n't mean anything bad.'' `` It would be a disaster if the results of the voting would not meet the aspirations of the people,'' he said. <PERSON> Arvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Matulionis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, Philosophy and Law, told delegates 56 percent of local residents polled Nov. 30 approved of a separate <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said 61 percent of the party members polled approved of the idea. Sajudis observers say local Communist Parties in other republics such as <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> could follow <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s example soon and present <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with a splintered party when he convenes the 28th national party congress next fall. Ethnic Lithuanians make up about 80 percent of its 3.7 million people. Russians make up about 10 percent, and there are smaller populations of Poles and other ethnic groups.

 A jury today began deliberating whether <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is guilty of murder for each of the 27 people killed in a fiery 1987 collision between his pickup and a church bus. The jury received the case after <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers contended in closing arguments that the bus was unsafe and that the factory worker is not responsible for the deaths. Prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> countered that bus safety was not the issue, adding, `` The apologies ... are too late. Now it's time to pay.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken-driving in what authorities have called the nation's deadliest alcohol-related traffic accident. Twenty-four youngsters and three adults from a church group died in the fire that engulfed the former school bus after <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s pickup rammed it on Interstate 71, five miles south of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, on May 14, 1988 The chassis of the 1977 school bus was made by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s attorneys argued during his murder trial that the bus was unsafe because of a vulnerable gas tank and combustible interior materials `` Somebody should pay for it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s three attorneys. `` But <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> should not have to pay for something <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> did.'' <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> and another defense attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, told the jury that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was intoxicated and was driving on the wrong side of the interstate. That caused the collision but not the fiery deaths, they said. `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> has the rest of his life, every waking minute, to remember this,'' <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. No one `` can do anything to punish him worse.'' The prosecutor argued that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s attorneys mounted an attack on the safety of the school bus out of desperation because no one could deny that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> caused the crash. `` School buses do n't have anything to do with it,'' <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said. `` The elements of the alleged crime would be the same if <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> had collided with a motorcycle or a family car.'' The jury received instructions from Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> gave the jury two alternatives to the 27 murder charges _ second-degree manslaughter, punishable by five to 10 years in prison, and reckless homicide, punishable by one to five years. Murder is punishable by 20 years to life. To convict the 36-year-old <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of murder, the jury would have to find that he had acted with `` extreme indifference to the value of human life,'' <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> told the panel. <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s actions _ driving drunk and on the wrong side of a highway _ fit that description. The defense has claimed that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> did not intentionally get drunk and that the former school bus, manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sheller-Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was unsafe. Autopsies showed the fire, not the crash, killed the victims. <PERSON> Satterwhite </PERSON> told jurors they would be sequestered, spending nights in a motel under sheriff's guard, until reaching a verdict. Once sequestered, jurors could not be released, even for Christmas, the prosecutor said.

 In another time, another president said he would not see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made into `` a pitiful, helpless giant.'' The phrase echoed as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops to crush and capture Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose Panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sanctions short of force. Part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours on Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declaring that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been decapitated as the strongarm leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his loyalist forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> called him a fugitive, and said he would be tracked and taken, to stand trial on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments. For more than two years, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had taunted and incited the giant, while his foes at home and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tried futilely to dislodge his grip on power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose watchword is prudence, said it was an enormous frustration. But he took it for nearly a year, for lack of an acceptable alternative. Then he took a risk, and went to war. `` Fellow citizens, last night I ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he told the nation Wednesday. `` ... I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were in grave danger.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gained prompt and predictable support at home, from Democrats as well as Republicans. He had briefed congressional leaders just before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces went into combat against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s loyalists in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces Presidents seldom face much political dissent when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces are in combat, especially with the kind of provocations <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> provided. His puppet assembly had declared a state of war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and an off-duty American officer was shot and killed by his forces on Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted the killing, the wounding of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman, the capture and beating of a third and threats against his wife. `` That was enough,'' the president said. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an eminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` ... And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and to bring Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had repeatedly encouraged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents to kick him out of power. He had said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was the problem, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> quarrel was with the general, not with the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, and that his ouster would instantly restore normal diplomatic and economic relations. Yet when dissident PDF officers attempted a coup on Oct. 3 and briefly held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, American forces stood by, inactive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders, but the administration decided against intervention. That drew protests from left and right, although some Republicans complained that dovish Democrats who opposed intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders had been told they could offer support for the coup `` if there were an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life and to do so without open military involvement ...'' Those instructions ring with irony now that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have been sent into open combat. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalled his October testimony, and the administration explanation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inaction at the time of the coup attempt. `` I said if this administration chose to use force, it would make its own decisions,'' he told a news conference. `` It would not act based on some unknown coup plotters' strategy or rationale.'' At least 11 American soldiers were killed in action early Wednesday, others wounded. That is the price of using military power. It was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use, 19 years ago. `` If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world,'' he said, announcing he had sent forces to attack Communist North Vietnamese sanctuaries in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered about 7,000 troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to join some 12,000 already stationed there as the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> garrison. Another 2,500 reinforcements were being deployed Wednesday. Later, there are sure to be told-you-so comments from those who argued the administration should have sent forces to join the October coup. And <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s purge of dissident PDF officers after that coup could make it more difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to quickly complete operations and withdraw the additional troops, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to do as quickly as possible. The newly-installed government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ led by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, thought to have won the May election <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled _ will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in place of his henchmen. Stability under an elected government will be the real test of success, whatever happens to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The administration has been wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle. American intervention puts that to the tes: if the theory is correct and he is powerless, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is irrelevant. But if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and running continuing operations against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, the administration will have a major problem on its hands. When President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces into action in the 1983 invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and the 1986 air raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the operations were swift and brief. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be a mission accomplished and quickly ended. Prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at home and intensify the inevitable Latin American resentment against <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> intervention, no matter the cause. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out swiftly, by lifting economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under the new <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, and by promising anew that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

 Bomb-sniffing dogs and dozens of police provided security today at the funeral of a federal judge killed by a parcel bomb in a wave of attacks that may have been carried out by white racists. More than 700 mourners, including Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>, filled a suburban church for the service in memory of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was a man `` who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed,'' his friend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> told mourners. `` No wonder his assassins could not stand such a man in their presence.'' The 58-year-old <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was killed by a package bomb Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents say the bomb and three others, including the one that killed <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 42, on Monday, all bore <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> return addresses or postmarks. Links to <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> school desegregation efforts have been established in all four cases, leading investigators to speculate that a white racist group may be responsible. After police defused a bomb at an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Tuesday, the organization placed all its offices on alert. Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war on various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the bombings, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, in a quiet area of this wooded, exclusive suburb of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, was surrounded by police barriers as part of security precautions that included bomb searches and guards. Among those attending was <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who oversees <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s appellate circuit. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, remained hospitalized from wounds received in the bombing. Family friends said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s body had been cremated and his ashes will be placed in the church. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said the attacks will not prevent the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> from `` moving forward full speed ahead on the job of trying to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a place of equal justice for all.'' `` I think it's the work of white supremacists without any question. I think it reveals the derangement, demented, criminally stupid minds,'' Hooks said. Hooks said he had been assured by Sessions and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> that the bombings were being given the highest priority. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, told The <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published today that the deadly package addressed to <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was mailed Thursday from <LOCATION> Newnan </LOCATION>, a town of about 11,500 people 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The bomb that killed <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on Monday is believed to have been mailed Friday from <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, 82 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON> said, but the postmark was destroyed in the blast. The Atlanta Constitution quoted unidentified sources as saying it bore a return address in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, a town near <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>. The bomb found Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> also was mailed Friday from <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Macon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and News the package bore the return address of a <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> lawyer. Another device was mailed Saturday from the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> clerk's office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON> said, and the Constitution reported it bore the return address of an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyer. The court, on which <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> served, handled appeals of federal cases from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. That bomb was removed safely. All four bombs reportedly were designed to hurl nails or shrapnel. Sessions told reporters that some organized group could be responsible for the bombs. He said a pattern of racist attacks `` has to be one of the factors in the back of all our minds.'' `` Common sense would tell you _ the number of incidents ... in three different states, all part of the 11th Circuit. It's quite possible there is more than one -LRB- person responsible -RRB-,'' Sessions said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed an organized group was behind the attacks. He instructed the civil rights group's 1,800 offices to take precautions in handling mail. Hooks also said he fears the bombings were the beginning of a wave of attacks: `` The thing has come to the place where everyone may be in jeopardy, from the president on down.'' One possible link between the cases was the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to desegregate Southern schools, authorities said. Evidence included: _ <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> wrote the 11th Circuit's unanimous opinion three months ago that ruled in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in a desegregation suit against the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, schools _ <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a black city alderman, represented the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in another desegregation case involving <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> area schools On Sept. 29, an 11th Circuit panel that did n't include <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> upheld a desegregation plan opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter talked with <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> about its desegregation case, but <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> did not represent them `` He gave us some advice,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbill </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timothy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> shared a moderate-to-progressive political stance and an interest in civil rights, but friends of the two believed they had never met.

 National parks need special protection from air pollution that the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has failed to provide, an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> lawmaker said Wednesday in calling for a special amendment to the Clean Air Act. `` Manmade pollution is creeping into our parks and wildernesses, robbing us of what makes them special,'' Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., said at a news conference He was joined by former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. The problem is especially acute in the open spaces of the West, which scientists believe are particularly vulnerable to sulfur dioxide and other pollutants, he said. The problem has gotten so bad, he said later in an interview, that polluted air has become as much a health problem as a visibility problem. He said it is affecting visibility at airports, observatories on isolated peaks and military testing grounds. `` Federal officials have a choice: Either clean up our parks or adopt rules to warn Americans of health problems they may face from visiting polluted parks,'' he said. The 1977 Clean Air Act contains a provision to protect the national park system against visual pollution. But <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has concentrated only on the `` simple problem of plume blight _ pollution from a few distinct sources near the park.'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said he would try to amend the act in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> early next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will be taking up its version of the bill as its top priority in 1990. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s proposal would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to identify sources of emissions, provide for federal implementation of controls if states do not act, broaden the categories of areas protected and give federal park and wilderness officials earlier notice of permit applications.

<TEXT>
 An appeals court Wednesday reviewed evidence against a Palestinian suspect in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing amid heightened security for the first anniversary of the disaster. Another court in <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION> will announce its verdict Thursday against the Palestinian, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>, on separate charges of murder and attempted murder for bombs directed against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Jewish targets in northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1985 and 1986. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> faces a maximum life sentence, which in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> means 20 years or less. If convicted, he still could be extradited to stand trial in a foreign country on charges related to the Dec. 21, 1988, explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, legal experts said. Scottish detectives questioned <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> in the Flight 103 case Tuesday, but the Swedish news agency <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> reported that he refused to cooperate. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> was charged on one count of murder in the death of a passerby from a bomb outside the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> airline office in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> in 1985. He was accused in other bombings in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The 35-year-old former Egyptian army soldier and member of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has lived in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for six years. As friends and relatives of the 270 people killed on Flight 103 gathered in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> for the anniversary of the bombing, anti-terrorism experts in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> warned of possible attacks Thursday to mark the occasion. They said a guilty verdict by the <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION> court could increase the risk of a vengeance attack. Tougher security checks were being imposed in airports around <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>, who has been active in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy for the last two years, took a charter plane for his travels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and was assigned extra bodyguards, the <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. Suspicion of a link to the Flight 103 case arose when it was established that <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> before the bombing. He is believed to possess clothing from the same store to which detectives traced clothes from the bomb-rigged suitcase. According to one theory, the bomb was brought from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where it was loaded onto Flight 103. The <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> appeals court was reviewing the legality of the seizure of clothing Nov. 27 from <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION>, a university town north of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Uppsala </LOCATION> court had approved the removal of 15 bags of clothing and authorized the Scottish police to take the evidence to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for analysis. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON>'s lawyer appealed the decision. <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> said the court was weighing whether the suspicions against <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Talb </PERSON> justified upholding the lower court's ruling.

 The invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by American troops is the latest in nearly 20 episodes over the past 150 years in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has used its military might in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Prior to the action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the most recent outright use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force in the region was six years ago, on Oct. 25, 1983, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces led an invasion of the island of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his aim was to rescue American students and to end Cuban use of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation as a training ground for terrorists. In April 1965, President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> after rebels tried to seize power. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he was acting to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and to prevent Communists from taking power. Some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> also sent troops. A truce was signed a month after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces arrived and all were withdrawn by September 1966. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines also had occupied the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> from 1916-1924 to keep order among rival political factions. Short of combat, troops in recent years were stationed at the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and military advisers were sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to train the military forces of friendly Central American governments. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also supported the Contra rebels seeking to oust the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Support for the Contras is the latest phase in a long saga of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. About 2,500 Marines were sent in 1912 to protect the government and about 100 of them remained for 13 years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also sent gunboats and troops to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1926 to help the government during a rebellion led by Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes bombed guerilla strongholds, eventually forcing <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> to flee to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops withdrew in early 1933. Further back in history, two episodes helped make the reputations of future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents: Gen. <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s capture of <ORGANIZATION> Buena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> in the Mexican War and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s charge up <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in the Spanish-American In 1961, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s administration would be shaken after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to deliver military backing to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> exiles seeking to foster revolution in their homeland. It was more than 80 years ago when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops first landed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Then, the troops were deployed to support a fledgling Panamanian government that had revolted against Colombian rule in late 1903. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had failed to convince <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> project but the new Panamanian government endorsed it, beginning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the southernmost country of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. That first use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> came nearly 50 years after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops ventured onto Latin American soil in a war with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A decade after Texans revolted against the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers crossed into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1846, beginning a war that gave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> land that is now <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Americans ultimately occupied much of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the war brought fame to <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, whose forces won the battle of <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> in 1847. That victory catapulted <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to the presidency, and the war ended in 1848. It would be 67 years before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops again invaded <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, this time to seize the shipping port <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors were arrested in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> ordered the 1914 seizure to block arms shipments to Mexican forces. In 1916, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pershing </PERSON> was sent into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful bid to capture revolutionary leader <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, blamed for the deaths of 16 Americans during an incursion into <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also set <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> to quell political unrest in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in 1915. They remained until 1934. It was the Spanish-American War of 1898 that brought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> battleship <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was off the coast of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> when it mysteriously exploded in February 1898. President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, who had sent the ship there to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during an uprising against <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> rule, blamed <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the explosion and declared war. Five months later, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> troops landed in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, then controlled by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s exploits at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> helped set him on the road to the presidency. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> would later become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would experience a period of turmoil that intermittently involved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. Most American troops left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1902 after elections and an agreement with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government for a lease for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base at <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would return four years later because opposition to the elected government had turned into open rebellion. American troops left <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> again in 1909 after a new government was elected, but returned in 1917 to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies and citizens during yet another uprising. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s turmoil would continue through dictatorships and the rise to power of <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in January 1959. Two years later, President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> refused to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to a group of Cuban exiles seeking to oust <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> by invading at the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pigs </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s south coast. The exiles had been promised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance and the episode proved a major embarrassment for the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration. Nineteen months later, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> imposed a naval blockade of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> during the 1962 missile crisis, stationing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels off <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> until the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its missiles from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter gunships and fighter jets thundered through the hot, moonlit night toward the caldron of light surrounding Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters. They whined overhead before diving toward the strongman's compound two miles east of the <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> promontory overlooking the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> Armored personnel carriers and truckloads of soldiers roared out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army bases on the roads below, surrounding the compound with the crackle of machine guns, the cough of mortars and the heavy thump of cannon. The sky blazed with tracer fire and, eventually, glowed with the light of a giant fire. Daybreak revealed the compound reduced to rubble with only scattered shots still being fired. A pall of acrid smoke spread slowly over the city, as scores of dazed survivors fled their homes in surrounding residential neighborhoods. Hundreds of refugees _ men, women, and children _ could be seen in the street, walking in the tropical morning to churches, hospitals, and schools, in search of safety. During the day the city turned into a scene of chaos. Armed toughs who support <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> took to the streets, some of them commandeering cars. One resident said her car was stolen when a man put a gun to her head and demanded the keys. Shortly before noon, the looting began. Even though sporadic shooting continued all over the Panamanian capital, there were dozens of people breaking into supermarkets and stores and making off with whatever they could lay their hands on. Most of the looters were just poor people from the slums. Off they went with stacks of food, cameras, home appliances, TV sets, mattresses and clothes. Although a few scattered shots could be heard here and there, a festive atmosphere reigned as people walked away with food, tires, even refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at a time. The major afternoon fighting, however, came in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> neighborhood to the northeast, a stronghold of the civilian `` Dignity Battalions'' that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had set up to help enforce his rule. Attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> barracks on top of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, and once again came the refugees, fleeing on foot or in their cars, if they could. At dozens of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints, those who wanted to pass had to get out of their cars and drop to their knees while the vehicle was thoroughly searched. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers herded together about 300 Panamanian prisoners in a field near <LOCATION> Albrook </LOCATION> Air Base, at the foot of Diablo Heights. Relatives and friends of the captives waited across the street. Many of the prisoners had been taken in raids on houses in <LOCATION> Diablo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> neighborhood. Jeeps with mounted machine guns had swept through the neighborhood during the night, stopping at certain houses and taking the men prisoner. In one house, where four reporters were hiding along with the residents, the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wife noticed an 8-by-10 color photo of her husband as a student shaking hands with none other than Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. She swiftly hid the photo, potentially offensive to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> eyes, in their bedroom.

 Journalists' confidential sources and information they gathered must be `` highly material and relevant,'' and unavailable from elsewhere, before reporters can be compelled to reveal them, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled. The 5-0 ruling released Wednesday, overturned contempt citations against two <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> reporters. In September, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> held in contempt reporters <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudok </PERSON> of The Evening Journal of <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> of WXVA-FM in <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. They had refused to testify at a hearing about Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s decision to fire an employee `` In this case, the information sought to be obtained was tenuous at best to the main purpose of the hearing, which was to provide -LRB- the employee -RRB- a hearing on her discharge,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said. Eight news media groups, including The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, had filed a legal brief in support of the newspaper and radio station. `` The decision ... is really a victory for the people of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> because it allows reporters for all media to write the comments and viewpoints of the people who live in this state,'' said <PERSON> Page </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON>, editor of The Evening Journal. <PERSON> Burdette </PERSON> said he hopes the issue will prompt lawmakers to pass <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s first `` shield'' laws for reporters. Such legislation would help journalists protect news sources to whom they've promised anonymity in return for information. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said she was relieved. `` I'm just glad I get to eat turkey at Christmas and I do n't have to be in jail,'' she said. The opinion, written by Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said there could be cases when reporters' information is pertinent to a legal proceeding. In the case of <PERSON> Hudok </PERSON> and <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, however, First Amendment privilege should prevail, the opinion said. The case stemmed from <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>'s decision to fire Magistrate Clerk <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Butner </PERSON> in June. The judge said she publicly injected herself into a criminal matter pending before magistrate court by talking to reporters. <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> had sought to force the reporters to testify about their conversations with <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, who <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said is bound by judicial ethics to refrain from commenting on court matters.

 <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> learned of the battle to oust <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> when he heard the buzz of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters over his neighborhood, which then broadcast warnings to soldiers at a nearby military headquarters to leave the building. `` They were shouting down over the PA system. ... They said they had no problem with them, they just wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, through an interpreter. Then the shooting began in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Fires triggered by the battle leveled turn-of-the century wooden homes in a three-block area. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who escaped with 11 members of his extended family, said he counted six bodies of those loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> lying dead in the streets as he and others fled the immediate area. Many ended up at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office. `` They were carrying TVs and their belongings on their heads,'' <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiltshire </PERSON>, whose husband heads the office, said in a telephone interview. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> offered refugees from the fighting cookies and punch _ the only food available _ then began cooking lentils and rice for a midday meal. `` That's all we have. We ca n't get out to get to a store,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Wiltshire </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and his family were escorted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to a church, where they took shelter for about five hours until the church was hit by an incendiary device. `` The church also burned down,'' said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, 32. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a clerk in the ministry of education, sought shelter along with about 100 other people at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office near the entrance to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. He escaped with a few extra pants and shirts. Everything else was destroyed. `` They burned everything down,'' <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Backalt </PERSON>, another civilian who fled from the area of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters with his wife and three children, said in English. `` I see plenty people dead in the street.'' The fires in the houses resulted from the intense fighting; they were not targets, eyewitnesses said. <PERSON> Backalt </PERSON> said the bodies _ he did not know how many _ were mainly members of the <ORGANIZATION> Dignity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION>, a paramilitary group loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Backalt, a self-employed stove repairman, said he was sleeping when he heard gunfire. He said his house caught fire, and he and his family went out into the street. None of his family was injured. As they walked the streets, he said, they saw a helicopter crash. He said he did n't know if it was <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> or a Panamanian helicopter. Although he lost his home, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said he was glad the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decided to attack. `` This is the best thing that could have happened,'' he said. Because <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters was located in a slum section of the city, most of those left homeless are poor, said Maj. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiltshire </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> office.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official flew to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Wednesday after failing to arrange an immediate swap of ailing and wounded prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> more than a year after their cease-fire. <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnadinger </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> chief of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, ended his visit after five days of talks in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. He held similar meetings last week in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with Iranian officials, seeking the repatriation of 1,000 wounded and ailing prisoners held by both sides. <PERSON> Gnadinger </PERSON> refused to comment to reporters on the outcome of his visit before his departure. But <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigger </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, said, `` I may say nothing concrete has been achieved. ... This is a long process which needs more effort.'' <PERSON> Gnadinger </PERSON> had hoped for an immediate release of the sick and wounded as a first step toward settling the issue of the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> prisoners of war under article 118 of the Third Geneva Convention. The article calls for repatriation of POWs immediately after hostilities cease. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered some 50,000 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and more than 19,500 in Iraqi camps. Many of the POWs have been held since the early stages of the war that broke out in September 1980. However, diplomats and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials say the two sides hold 100,000 POWs between them. Last year, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> released about 400 sick and wounded prisoners. But the operation was stopped when both sides accused the other of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum. Earlier this week, hopes were raised that an agreement for a prisoner swap was imminent. <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Witri </PERSON>, chief of the legal department at the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> had responded positively to a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> call to this effect. But Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> quickly reiterated the Iranian position, undermining the effort. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has insisted it will not agree to swap the prisoners or implement any other peace move with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> until Iraqi troops withdraw from land they occupied in the final weeks of the war. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted hostilities on Aug. 20, 1988, but peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the withdrawal issue and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for a border demarcation accord that gives it sovereignty over the entire Shatt-Al-Arab waterway. The channel, a confluence of the great <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers, is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s sole gateway to the gulf. Before the war, the border ran down the middle of <PERSON> Shatt-Al-Arab </PERSON>.

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in both parties rallied behind the president's decision to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with most saying he had little choice, though there were scattered objections. `` I support the president's decision,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who has been among <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s harshest critics on other foreign policy matters. `` It was made necessary by the reckless actions of General -LRB- <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' There was a small core of harsh dissent, with one lawmaker calling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action `` a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy'' and saying the move rested on shaky legal ground. But for the most part, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> welcomed the restoration of a democratic government and said all other possibilities had been exhausted. `` It's an action the president determined, and I think under the circumstances <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will support his position,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` American troops are in the field and casualties are being taken Under these circumstances, it's not the proper time for a lot of complicated debate.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he expressed `` some concerns'' when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called about 10 p.m. Tuesday to inform him of the impending operation. But, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> added, the concerns `` do n't qualify my support for the president's action.'' The White House informed the top four leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of the planned assault just before it was launched late Tuesday, and contacted other key members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> once the operation was under way. Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member, called the action `` an overwhelming success because democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> also called the operation `` a very important moment in the presidency of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It is a time when the president asserted his own leadership and did so effectively.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., said the action was justified `` We've had a long period of provocation by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` You can only go so long with this provocation, this pushing, this harassment. He crossed over the line. It backfired on him. I think he's a cornered tiger.'' A rare dissent came from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who said the threat to the canal was less than clear and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not adequately inform <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Personally, unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> or against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people or installations, I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said. But, he said he would support the administration until the operation was completed and hoped for `` as few deaths as possible'' among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., harshly criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action, calling it `` a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy that continues our mindless 100-year abuse of small Central American nations. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on the Constitution, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had violated the provision that requires <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' consent to go to war. `` There was no danger to our national security from this weak, small country, nor was the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in real peril,'' he said. However, the consensus on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> was that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had exhausted diplomatic efforts and economic pressure, and was left with little alternative after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s public declaration of war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, said the lack of immediate criticism from Latin American governments was testimony to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s earlier diplomatic efforts through the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other groups `` The reaction is one of silence, and that would have to be interpreted as benign support at this point,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. `` If we end up having to be the security blanket for the new government and you have a divided Panamanian public, then I think that support would turn into criticism.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> operation erases criticism by Democrats that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been `` overly timid'' in dealing with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and other critical foreign policy issues. `` I think what it says politically is that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> keeps his own counsel and makes his own decisions,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision and praised the action as a `` blow against the international drug trade. `` <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had explicitly declared war on us and on his own people. He killed an unarmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen and had brutalized others,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` The president has protected <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and has struck a blow against the international drug trade.'' Some lawmakers expressed concern about whether the Panamanian military could be purged of those who aided <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in drug trafficking and won over to support the new government. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should try to freeze the millions of dollars <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has reportedly accumulated as a result of his drug involvement `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was like a cancer,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was making us a laughingstock, he was baiting us, he was threatening American lives. We had no choice.''

<TEXT>
 Air traffic controllers at 14 facilities near the East and West coasts give their operations the lowest marks for safety and other concerns, a congressional report said Wednesday. The report, by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, ranked controller operations around the country according to responses from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> controllers to an extensive 1988 survey. The survey showed widespread concern over operations of the system that guides all aircraft over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A significant number of the 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> controllers who responded anonymously saw problems. Eighty-five percent perceived a shortage of fully qualified controllers, 65 percent said they handled too much traffic in peak hours, a majority were concerned about the quality of training and 43 percent said their morale was low. The aggregate results of the survey had been previously released, but the new report ranked 84 facilities according to the percentage of employees giving negative responses on each of several key questions. It says <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> centers had the most negative responses on key questions of workload, facility staffing, overtime, training, safety and morale, while centers in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> had the fewest. Twelve airport facilities with the most negative responses were: <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tower </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> traffic control center; <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, traffic control center; <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> traffic control center, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National. Those with the fewest negative responses were <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> airport; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> traffic control center; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. All other surveyed facilities fell into a middle category, with a mix of negative and positive responses to the six key questions `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should be asking people -LRB- at the lowest-rated centers -RRB- why they think their center is performing so poorly,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who released the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> rankings. <PERSON> Molinari </PERSON>, who is leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the year to become borough president in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said controllers's views should be `` key to resolving the chronic problems in the air traffic control system. He said high-ranking centers and terminals also should be studied to see why employees rate them so well. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> director for transportation issues, said the report has been well received by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and should be a useful tool in improving operations. In response to the report, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said its system is safe and improvements have been made since the survey was taken, including an increase in the number of controllers by about 400 to 14,822 as of Nov. 30. `` The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> data is not fully consistent with results of our own surveys which show continuing improvements in job satisfaction areas,'' spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> surveyed employees in 1984, 1986 and 1988, he said. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said, however, the agency would use the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> data `` to see if there's any new information here to help us improve the system.''

 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s secretary of state, whose office has been at the center of a bingo and political corruption scandal, died today, more than a week after shooting himself in the head. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, 57, died at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>. The one-time legislative power broker shot himself Dec. 12 in a suicide attempt on the front porch of his <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> home. As secretary of state, he was in charge of regulating bingo and spending by lobbyists and political campaigns, all of which were involved in a federal-state investigation that has resulted in 22 people being indicted or pleading guilty since January. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> testified in September and November before federal grand juries investigating bingo corruption in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. He said he was told by federal agents that he was not a target of the investigation. Last week, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banner </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying that federal investigaors were focusing on how <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> solicited campaign money from architects, engineers and bingo operators. As a result of the probe one former <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> aide, former chief bingo inspector W.D. `` Donnie'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, has gone to federal prison for offenses incliding including extorting payoffs from bingo operators; his longtime administrative assistant and secretary, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, has been named an unindicted co-conspirator. She admitted taking thousands of dollars from a campaign fund. Controversy, much of it growing out of <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s passionate devotion to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, followed him during most of his 18 years in state government. He was once known as The Godfather on Capitol Hill because of his absolute, partisan control over legislation in the dual roles of chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Calendar Committee. The secretary of state's office had regulated charitable bingo since it was legalized for charity fund-raising in 1971. In 1989 the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled bingo unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Britain Will Give Passports to Estimated 225,000 in Hong Kong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said Wednesday it will give special residence rights to an estimated 225,000 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> to prevent a crippling brain drain in the colony before it reverts to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. Right-wing legislators in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> threatened a parliamentary rebellion against what one called an appalling wave of immigration. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> condemned the plan. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> that a maximum of 50,000 key people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s public and private sector would be given full British citizenship, along with their families. He estimated the total at 225,000 people. Giving key people in government, business and the professions the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was essential to persuade them to remain in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and ensure that it passes `` successfully through the final eight years of British rule,'' he said. The confidence of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 6 million residents was `` at a low ebb'' and the `` hemorrhage of talent'' was increasing, putting the competitiveness of its economy at risk, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. This year, 42,000 people left and 55,000 are expected to leave next year. `` Many of those who are leaving would not do so if they could obtain the assurance of right of abode in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> therefore decided to offer full British citizenship to a maximum 50,000 key people from many walks of life who will be selected on a `` points system,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. An estimated 1,500 families of Indian descent will be included. `` The decisive criteria will be the value of the individual's service to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the extent to which people in their category of employment are emigrating,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said He said long service with British institutions and knowledge of English would be taken into account. About 3.25 million <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese have British passports, but no residence rights. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said giving all of them the right to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would create `` unacceptable strains here'' while giving residency to just a few would n't solve <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s problem and might make it worse. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the government welcomed the package though Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Several legislators said they would have preferred full passports for all British nationals. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the package was not `` solely for the elite'' and would help create the stability the colony needed. But former <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebbit </PERSON>, the ringleader of an estimated 50 <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> rebels, icily told the foreign secretary he disagreed `` with almost everything you said.'' He demanded: `` Does the pledge that we have given for the last four general elections that there would be no further large scale immigration still stand or not?'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> retorted the aim was to persuade key people to stay in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> but even if many of them did emigrate, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would gain professional talent and expertise from one of the world's most successful societies. `` This is the last main chapter in the story of this country's empire I am rather keen, and I'm sure you are rather keen, that the last chapter should not end in a shabby way,'' he said. Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> called the decision `` appalling'' and a guaranteed vote-loser in the next election, which must be held by June 1992. Fellow Conservative <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> said many people would never forgive the government for opening the door to further immigration in overcrowded <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` They feel a deep resentment after a generation that imposed immigration into this country. I believe you will not be forgiven,'' he said. Labor lawmaker <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, the first black woman elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> of holding views similar to former <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Enoch </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> who opposed black immigration. `` Speaking in Mr <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>'s words as an ` imposed immigrant' and an MP,'' she noted that `` people outside the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have listened with mounting incredulity while elements in the Tory backbenches have out-bid each other with sub-Powellite rhetoric on this subject.'' She said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must withdraw from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> `` with honor, and not in the shabby and shameful way some members are trying to create an issue of an imminent yellow peril.'' Labor's foreign affairs spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> called the plan `` unreasonable, unworkable, invidious and divisive.'' Laborite <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaz </PERSON> said the plan represented `` one law for the rich and another for the poor.''

<BYLINE>`The Face of Hunger Is The Face of the Young Child' ^By WILLIAM

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Urban hunger and homelessness rose most rapidly this year among families with children, the nation's mayors said Wednesday, with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> telling reporters that, `` increasingly, the face of hunger is the face of the young child.'' He released a survey of 27 cities by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> that said many cities had so many requests for help that they had to turn away families and others seeking shelter. Requests for emergency shelter were up 25 percent. Requests for food were up 19 percent. One in four homeless people was a child; almost two-thirds of those seeking food were children or their parents. The organization of big-city mayors based its report on a survey of officials in 27 cities, who reported on public and private relief efforts. The cities ranged from the nation's largest, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, with a population of 81,000. The report found a shifting composition of the nation's urban homeless, toward families with children. Families made up 36 percent of the survey cities' homeless in 1989, up from 34 percent a year ago and 27 percent in 1985. The percentage of homeless who are single men continued to fall, from 60 percent in 1985 to 46 percent in 1989. Democrats cited the report, released annually by the organization of big-city mayors, as evidence of neglect of the poor by the Republican White House. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, said the repoort demonstrated `` a tragic ending for the decade'' and `` an embarrassing legacy for the present and previous administrations.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a Democrat, said increased urban misery was a consequence of congressional inattention as well as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policies. `` It has not been the politically fashionable thing up on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to help poor people,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who heads the mayors' task force on hunger and homelessness. `` I do n't see how they can turn their backs and walk away any longer.'' The conference, which has reported rising hunger and homelessness annually for five years, said there was a sharp increase in the percentage of the homeless population that abused drugs and alcohol. These accounted from 44 percent of the homeless population, up from 34 percent last year. The increased requests for help were found in nearly all the cities surveyed. The number of families with children requesting emergency food assistance increased an average 14 percent, and was up in nine of 10 cities. Nearly two-thirds of the requests for food were from children or their parents. The lack of affordable housing was cited as a leading cause of both hunger and homelessness. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said that the poor who have homes, paying increasingly large portions of their incomes for housing, often have less money left for food and other necessities. The survey said that three-fourths of the cities could not meet all the demands for food and had to turn people away _ an average of 17 percent of their requests. `` While there's a lot of things going on at the local level _ shelters, soup kitchens ... _ the problem continues to grow and grow and grow,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. One-quarter of the requests for shelter by homeless families go unmet, the survey found. Three out of four of the cities said shelters must turn away homeless families because of the lack of resources. On average, the study said, the composition of the cities' homeless population is 46 percent single men, 36 percent families with children, 14 percent single women and 4 percent young people on their own Blacks made up 51 percent, whites 35 percent. A quarter of the homeless were veterans and a quarter were severely mentally ill. The Cities surveyed were <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The army's tough measures of house demolitions, deportations and school closures have failed to reduce protests by Palestinians and at times have inflamed the two-year uprising, according to a study published Wednesday. The study, part of an annual assessment of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> military developments by <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, challenged often-stated army claims that strong reprisals served as a deterrent to unrest. Also on Wednesday, a military court sentenced three Palestinians to life in prison for an Oct. 30, 1988, firebomb attack on an Israeli bus that killed a mother and her three children as well as a soldier who tried to rescue them. Soldiers tried to attack the three defendants after the verdict and turned on reporters as they left the court. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> prisoner in the custody of the Shin Bet secret service was found dead Tuesday night in his cell. Arab reporters identified him as <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and said he was taken for questioning Dec. 7. As a new step against the uprising, the army spokesman's office said the army would begin confiscating property of Palestinian parents who failed to cover the bail and fines of their children. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a leaflet signed by the PLO-backed uprising leadership called for a general strike on Dec. 24 to mourn the deaths of the 631 Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and civilians in the revolt. Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 161 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as alleged collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded in scattered stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. Monsignor <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch, called for peace in the Holy Land in his traditional Christmas message: `` Peace on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is possible only when all people and all states concerned recognize the legitimate rights of all individuals and nations to freedom and self-determination.'' The study on the uprising in the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Middle East Military Balance was based on army figures and conducted by <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, a retired army brigadier general who served as military governor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in 1976-78. `` What I discovered is there was no reduction in the number of incidents,'' <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It means to my mind that -LRB- such measures -RRB- did n't have a serious effect on the strength of the intefadeh,'' uprising in Arabic. Since the uprising began in December 1987, army figures show 244 houses have been destroyed and 116 sealed. But <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> said they led to no decrease in violence as claimed by army commanders. `` We found no correlation whatsoever between the number of houses demolisehd and the number of violent incidents recorded, or the number of Israeli casualties, or even the number of petrol bombs thrown, in the following month,'' <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> wrote. In fact, his study showed, the number of incidents increased after the heaviest periods of house demolitions. For example, 24 houses were destroyed in November 1988, and incidents of stone throwing, barricade building and rioting rose by 1,195, or about 74 percent, to 2,790 in the following month. Deportation of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists has been considered the most severe measure against the uprising, but <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> said it proved impotent as a deterrent and actually inflamed the situation. `` There is a clear correlation between the number of residents deported ... and an ensuing increase in the number of violent incidents and Israeli casualties,'' he said. In April 1988, 16 Palestinians were deported, the largest number in a single month, but the number of violent incidents rose by 210, he said, adding there was a similar rise after 13 deportations in January 1989. In all, 60 Palestinians were deported in the past two years. <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> said closing schools initially appeared to have a restraining effect on violence in early 1988. But he said subsequent closures failed to have an effect and by early 1989 seemed to accelerate incidents. Universities have been closed since the start of the uprising. Elementary, junior and high schools were closed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for eights months in 1988 and throughout the first half of 1989. `` I do n't think it is possible to stop the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- by using these or other means,'' <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> told a news conference here, adding the only solution was a negotiated political settlement. <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON> suggested mass deportations and demolitions might reduce violence but said such practice would not be possible because of legal and moral restaints.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday branded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attack in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` gunboat diplomacy'' and a violation of international law. It called for an immediate end to the operation. However, a Soviet official played down any impact the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action might have on improved superpower relations, and the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s rhetoric was far milder than its denunciations of the 1983 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told a news briefing the sending of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` whatever its motivation, has provoked a feeling of serious concern in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action violated the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter and recognized rules of international relations and `` should be condemned by the international community.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, `` must immediately stop its armed intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Millions of Soviets saw dramatic footage of the attack on the nightly TV newscast `` Vremya.'' Commentator <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fyesunenko </PERSON>: `` Again, the world hears the loud voice of ` gunboat diplomacy' and understands perfectly well that the anger of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is caused not by the American concern about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but by the wish to disrupt the process of transferrence of the ownership rights of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- canal ... and to preserve the complex of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military bases on the territory of this country,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said none of the arguments put forth by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to justify the military operation stands up to scrutiny. `` This action is an example of notorious ` gunboat diplomacy' which has been used for decades by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an attempt to turn Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations into its backyard,'' the official news agency said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the troops were sent to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lives and apprehend Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who stands accused by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of setting up a succession of puppet regimes while running a military empire that purportedly trafficked in Colombian cocaine. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> dismissed the allegations of drug trafficking as a pretext to intervene in Panamanian affairs. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is steadfastly against international drug trafficking, he said, reflecting the Soviets' greater attention under leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to global problems that were once dismissed as symptoms of capitalist decay. `` We have something else here,'' <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said. `` We are commenting on the intervention of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a sovereign state. No matter what the motivation, this is something we are very concerned about.'' Despite Soviet concern, <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action would not reverse the direction of improved Soviet-U.S. relations. `` We are now in a situation where an event in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is not perceived, is not evaluated, in terms of confrontation between East and West,'' the Soviet spokesman said. But, he said, `` I think both the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stand to gain if a situation could be achieved where there is not interference in the affairs of others.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, however, said sending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> did not involve just another regional conflict. `` It is a dangerous encroachment on the unsteady equilibrium that has been achieved in the world arena,'' it said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it said, `` has challenged the entire international community and is acting against universal human interests.'' Official Soviet reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was markedly more restrained than when former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983. At that time, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of carrying out `` a stinking show.'' It also said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` obsessed with the ideas of world domination.'' <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said all countries would benefit from policies of non-interference, which the Soviet leadership under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has repeatedly professed to be its policy. `` All states would stand to gain when all peoples of all countries decide their own destinies,'' <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> processor is voluntarily recalling about 1,000 pounds of a frozen pork and rice product because it might be contaminated with a food-poisoning organism, Listeria monocytogenes, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Bodin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, sells the product through small distributors in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the product is cooked pork and rice wrapped in a sausage casing, or link. Each 10-ounce package sold in grocery stores contains two links and is shipped 12 per carton. Ten-pound bulk packages sold to restaurants and delicatessens contain approximately 30 links. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said consumers `` should not unwrap or taste the product'' and should return it to where it was purchased. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the presence of Listeria monocytogenes while investigating a case of listeriosis, the disease caused by the organism. Listeriosis was described as `` a rare but potentially serious'' disease. Most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems, including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill. Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, backache, and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea. In newborns, symptoms include respiratory distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have begun a major exchange of convicted spies, government security officials said Wednesday. The officials, who spoke on condition of anomyity, said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has begun releasing about 25 imprisoned Westerners, some of whom were serving life sentences. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will release four former Communist agents in return, they said. The four include two top catches of West German counterintelligence efforts: <PERSON> Margret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeke </PERSON>, an ex-secretary to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s president, and <PERSON> Elke </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, a former secretary in the chancellor's offices. Pardons for the two women were announced earlier in the day by a spokesman for West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>. The spokesman, <PERSON> Gernot </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON>, said he did not know if they had been released from prison. The two women have said, however, that they do n't want to be handed over to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and they wo n't be forced to leave <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, security officials said. Officials did not release the names of any other agents being released.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said Wednesday his financial dealings did not violate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules, but he apologized for mistakes he made and said he would work to restore public confidence. `` In retrospect, it is clear that I made mistakes and had lapses in judgment on these matters,'' he said at the first of four news conferences planned throughout the state Wednesday. `` I apologize this morning to the people of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, a Republican, said he did not intend to circumvent <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income when he signed a book deal with a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> publisher, which resulted in his earning $ 100,000 in outside income over two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine whether <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> used the book deal to circumvent limits on senators' income from speaking fees The limit in 1985 was about $ 22,500; in 1986 it was about $ 30,000. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> earlier said his appearances were to promote his two books, `` Neither Madmen Nor Messiahs'' and `` Prescription for Change,'' and that he cleared his activity with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled it was allowable compensation. The book deal was one of three plans <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> had for boosting his income when he was having financial difficulties. Two of the arrangements are being looked at by the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the book matter and allegations that he scheduled speeches in 1985 and 1986 to coincide with appointments he and his wife had with a marriage counselor in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is looking into <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> charging the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for rent at a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> condominium in which he had a financial interest.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday denied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bought oil from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in a bid to free three military men believed held by pro-Iranian militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Iranian TV reported. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement as saying that `` not even one barrel of oil'' had been sold to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, one of revolutionary <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main regional foes. `` According to irrevocable, declared principles of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has imposed a ban on the sale of oil and oil-related products to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the racist South African regime,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has vowed never to establish relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The statement added that no oil has been sold to those countries since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday confirmed an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> report Monday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> bought 2 million barrels of oil worth $ 36 million from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November to help free the three Israelis held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representatives also have discussed the possibility of selling <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> spare parts for its U.S.-made military hardware, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said, citing unidentified sources in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence. In addition to winning <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s help in releasing the Israelis, the oil purchases and the potential spare parts deal were intended to bolster <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s position against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, their common enemy, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. Spokesmen for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Energy, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> ministries refused to comment on the report. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had backed the oil deal in hopes that it could help the release of eight American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are among 18 Westerners held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by extremist groups. Most are captives of Iranian-backed Shiite factions. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders are avowedly anti-Israeli, but the Iranian economy, battered by 10 years of poor management and 8 years of war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, badly needs foreign exchange for post-war reconstruction. President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was closely involved in clandestine arms-for-hostages dealings with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1985-86. Three American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were freed in exchange for deliveries of U.S.-made anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile parts. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s so-calle pragmatists, is seeking to rebuild <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s links with the West to end 10 years of isolation and seek badly needed investment. He generally is considered to be in favor of freeing the hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but has limited room to maneuver because of opposition by hard-liners led by former Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, who has close ties with the Lebanese militants.

 Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, in a preview of her annual Christmas message, spoke optimistically of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> living as neighbors and an unselfish world uniting to save the planet. The queen broke the tradition of keeping her message secret until Christmas day and delivered part of it to an audience of 6,000 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night. Buckingham Palace confirmed Wednesday that sections of her speech would be included in her Christmas message to the 49-nation Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies. The monarch, speaking on the `` exciting'' political and social changes in recent months, said people in both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been able to think about themselves more as neighbors. And the key to the future was learning to `` love thy neighbor as thyself,'' she said. The possibility that <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s message might at last be heeded could make the 1990s a time for peace and cooperation to preserve the planet from environmental threats, she said. `` If we can reduce dishonesty, selfishness and injustice, the'90s might become years of peace and tranquillity, and a time to work together for the benefit of our planet as a whole,'' the queen said. `` We must be kind to it for the sake of our children and our children's children,'' she said. The queen was attending a Christmas fund-raising gala for the Save The Children charity, headed by her daughter, Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. `` I usually make my Christmas broadcast to the Commonwealth from <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> or Buckingham Palace,'' she said. `` This year I thought I would use the presence of 2,000 children in the Royal <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> to send this special message to the children of the Commonwealth.'' Among the children at the gala, where a cast of 700 told the story of the Bible from creation to the birth of Christ, were two of the queen's grandsons: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON>, 12, who is <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s son, and Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON>, 7, son of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>.

 Romance ca n't be used to avoid repaying loans to a former lover, the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The loans were not `` accumulated property of cohabiting parties,'' the court said. `` The practical effect of denying recovery under the facts of this case would be to permit a person to escape payment of a debt by simply entering into a romantic relationship with the creditor,'' the court said. In a <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hawk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> case, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed a lower court order and ordered <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goro </PERSON> to repay money lent to him by his former lover, <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Shold </PERSON>. It sent the case back to the lower court to determine precisely how much money is owed. Court records said the case began in 1977 when Ms. <PERSON> Shold </PERSON> was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Goro </PERSON> one of her teachers. They began an affair, though both were married to others at the time. By 1980, Ms. <PERSON> Shold </PERSON> was divorced and court records said <PERSON> Goro </PERSON> was anxious to obtain a divorce but pleaded financial difficulties. `` <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> agreed to help,'' the court said. `` Each month <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> would let <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> know the amount of his financial needs and she would give him a check for that amount.'' The relationship continued for years and included moves together to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and back to <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, the court noted. Finally, <PERSON> Goro </PERSON> was transferred to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in 1986 and the relationship ended, the court said. At that point, Ms. <PERSON> Shold </PERSON> sought repayment of the loans. `` <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> acknowledges that there was no specific agreement as to when the money would be repaid, because they did not know how long <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> would need the money,'' the court noted. Simply because the two had a long-term relationship does n't erase the responsibility to repay a loan, the court said `` <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON>'s claim does not arise out of the relationship of the parties, but from loans made to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>,'' the court said. `` Although the loans were intended to foster the relationship and, perhaps, to eventually encourage a more permanent arrangement, they retained their character as loans. `` They were clearly not the accumulated property of cohabiting parties.''

<TEXT>
 A jury began deliberating the fate of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> on Wednesday, after a prosecutor said `` it's time to pay'' for the 27 deaths he allegedly caused in an alcohol-related head-on collision with a crowded bus. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s lawyers said he will forever be tormented by last year's fiery disaster on Interstate 71, but argued that the real culprit was the builder of the bus, in which victims died of a fire rather than the crash itself. Special prosecutor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> must be held to account for his decision to drink and drive. `` I know that -LRB- <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> -RRB- regrets it. But that's got nothing to do with this case,'' <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said in closing arguments in <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` The apologies ... are too late. Now it's time to pay.'' Defense attorneys <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> manufactured a bus with a vulnerable fuel tank that made it a rolling `` bomb.'' <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> sobbed at times while his attorneys appealed to the jury to free him from 82 criminal charges _ 27 counts of murder, 12 of first-degree assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken driving. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 36, could be sentenced to 20 years to life in prison if convicted of murder. The jury was given options of second-degree manslaughter, five to 10 years, or reckless homicide, one to five years, on those counts. Conviction of first-degree assault carries a penalty of 10 to 20 years and the term is one to five years for wanton endangerment. <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> admittedly was drunk and driving on the wrong side of I-71 when his pickup collided with the former school bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church in <LOCATION> Hardin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Twenty-four children and three adults died in the explosion and fire that followed the collision. Of the 40 who escaped, 12 suffered severe burns. The crash occurred on May 14, 1988, a Saturday, when a church youth group was returning home from a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> amusement park. <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> repeated the defense's claim that <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, after a day of casual beer drinking, was tricked that night into drinking vodka, then allowed by supposed friends to drive away. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> could not have made a conscious decision to drive north in the southbound lanes of I-71, exhibiting the `` extreme indifference to human life'' that a jury must find to support a murder or first-degree assault charge, <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> said. Nor was it <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s fault that the bus _ its chassis built by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, its body by <ORGANIZATION> Sheller-Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ was susceptible to fire in a collision, <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> said. `` Should <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> have known ... he was going to hit a bomb?'' <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> said. He caused the collision, but `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> did not cause the fire, the explosion, the deaths, the injuries,'' <PERSON> Hildebrand </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said the defense theory of involuntary intoxication and a dangerous bus was an `` attempt to mask and cover -LRB- <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s -RRB- responsibility.'' `` Do you think if you drink all day and pour yourself behind the wheel or your vehicle that something bad is n't going to happen?'' <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said. `` This was a predictable disaster,'' he said. `` Drunk drivers going the wrong way happen every day. This time, he hit a bus.'' <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> pressed the jurors for a conviction on each murder count. `` These 27 people are just as dead -LRB- as if -RRB- they had been shot or stabbed. They're just as dead from his conduct,'' he said. Summers, in an emotional closing argument, said no one `` can do anything to punish him worse'' than <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> already punishes himself. `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> has the rest of his life, every waking minute, to remember this,'' he said. `` The punishment in his heart will never, never go away.'' But <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> sought to blame others _ <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and his drinking buddies. <PERSON> Richwalsky </PERSON> then showed the jury the identification picture on <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s driver license. In the picture, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> wore a cap with a four-word slogan _ `` Ride Hard _ Die Hard'' _ and added: `` On that Saturday night, ... he rode hard. Those people died hard.''

 With the squeeze of a trigger, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> thought he could give his ailing brother the most precious Christmas gift: a chance at good health. But <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s suicide wish to offer his heart to his 56-year-old brother could not be granted. Even if the organ were suitable, doctors said a transplant was impossible because the heart had stopped pumping. `` If it fits, and I'm pretty sure it will, as one last wish I'd like to offer him mine, so please do your best Thanks and Merry Christmas,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> wrote in a seven-page suicide letter found near his body. Authorities say <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 46, drove his van Monday evening to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He parked the vehicle outside the emergency room entrance and shot himself in the mouth with a .25 - caliber No one heard the shot, but minutes later a nurse saw <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> slumped inside the van. A medical team tried to revive him, but he was declared dead 19 minutes later. `` You ca n't take a non-beating heart out of a dead body and use it,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Farber </PERSON>. `` Heart transplants have to be a little bit more well-planned. His brother was n't even in the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> is being treated with medication for an enlarged heart and has been waiting for a transplant for three years. `` Bob's got everything to live for,'' his brother wrote. `` I figure I can do more good for him than myself.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said he was shocked by his brother's suicide. `` He thought of me in his last thoughts. He wanted somebody benefiting from his death,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> Belvedere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` If he had been killed accidentally, I could have accepted this. But to take his own life, something that is so precious to me, I ca n't deal with.'' Family members say <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> about eight years ago to stay with his sister after her husband died of a heart attack. In addition to his job at a <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> tavern, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> helped organize fund-raising events for his brother, who made regular trips to the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The tavern went out of business last year, and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> left his sister's apartment last month after an argument. For the past month he had been living in his van, which was cluttered with fund-raising posters for his brother. In a passage of the suicide letter addressed to his daughter, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, he wrote: `` I'm so sorry it had to come to this, Honey, but lately there's been too many downs and no ups for me on this roller coaster of life.'' He also requested that his family be together for his funeral and that the Mass include a tape recording of him singing `` I'll Be Home For Christmas.'' `` He was close to everybody, not only his family, but other people, too,'' said another brother, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON>'s business was to like people.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says No Major Withdrawal from Pacific Bases Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pentagon officials said Wednesday they were not actively considering a major military withdrawal from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, although planners recently drafted a memorandum outlining such a possibility. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials were considering closing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and withdrawing forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. That policy was outlined in a paper discussed at a meeting Monday involving <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, but many other options also were discussed, said two Pentagon officials. `` There is no decision and no deadline for a decision,'' said one of the sources. Both officials spoke on the condition he not be further identified. Another source said that no such withdrawal was being considered for the next two or three years. `` Our security in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is based on a robust presence, based on agreements with as many nations as possible,'' and therefore the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unlikely to close any East Asian bases in the near future, said another official. The meeting among the top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> brass concerned `` the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. We are looking at a number of long-term possibilities,'' said one source. Consideration of reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> was prompted by changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and budgetary restraints. `` There has been a change'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. `` The threat is reduced,'' said the source. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> forces include 222,238 personnel _ 50,000 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 45,000 in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, 32,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and 34,000 at sea, according to Pentagon statistics.

<HEAD>Report Changes Farm Income Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday showed that farmers did n't make as much money the last few years as agency economists had been reporting. The <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the professional <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency that keeps the financial books on agriculture, issued revised estimates reflecting higher expenses than had been used in the earlier computations. One of the effects was to reduce the net cash income of farmers _ the money left over after deducting cash expenses from gross cash proceeds during the calendar year. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops grown in earlier years. The revisions, based on 1987 figures from the federal census of agriculture, showed that net cash income in 1987 was $ 54.5 billion instead of the $ 57.7 billion reported as recently as a month ago. In 1988, according to te revisions, net cash income of farmers rose to $ 57.2 billion _ not the $ 59.9 billion stated previously. This year, according to the agency's new report, the net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 52 billion to $ 57 billion. That is unchanged from the earlier forecast. Economist <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON>, who oversees preparation of the monthly report, said that the 1987 census benchmark now being used showed that farm expenses turn out about 3 percent higher than had been estimated earlier. `` It suggests farmers did a little less well than we thought they were doing,'' <PERSON> Gajewski </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But he noted that despite the downward revisions, the new income numbers for those years are still records and that `` the rebound from the financial crisis is still very real.'' The revised figures also prompted changes in another method of farm accounting used by the agency. That involves `` net farm income,'' which measures the value of production, including federal payments, in a specific year. Changes in the value of crop and livestock inventories are part of the annual accounting. Under this method, net farm income in 1987 was $ 43.5 billion instead of the $ 47.1 billion reported previously. In 1988, net farm income was revised to $ 42.7 billion from $ 45.7 billion. This year's estimate was pegged at $ 48 billion instead of in a range of $ 48 billion to $ 53 billion used a month ago.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> delayed its debate on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday while trying to decide which government is legitimate: Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime or the U.S.-installed administration. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with the help of other Western members, stalled the council while pressing for recognition of a new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador to be appointed by the fledgling <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was widely believed to have won the presidency in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s national elections May 7. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the military leader, canceled the balloting before results were announced. The overnight invasion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces ousted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and installed <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was expected to appoint <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallarino </PERSON>, a Panamanian businessman in self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, said diplomats. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has no ambassador currently accredited at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The previous permanent representative, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, was promoted to foreign minister, and no one had taken his place. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government is reportedly trying to have its ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Merla </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellavita </PERSON>, accredited as its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was originally to hold its emergency meeting Wednesday morning, said officials at the Mission of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which currently chairs the council. Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said, however, that wrangles over which Panamanian ambassador was representing the legitimate government delayed the meeting. Council members held meetings among themselves to decide how to proceed. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is faced with having to decide which foreign minister represents <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate government: <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s appointee, <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, or whomever <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> appoints. In an afternoon news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is moving to appoint ambassadors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acted in self -- defense when it sent its military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON>, the ambassador of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which called for an emergency <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting, retorted that `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no legal or ethical right to intervene in other countries' affairs.'' Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> said `` We want the council to call for an immediate withdrawal of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. troops.'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> told reporters outside the council that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the right to intervene under Article 51 of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter, `` which provides for the use of armed force to defend a country, to defend our interests and our people, it's the so-called ` self-defense article.''' Panamanian soldiers shot and killed a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer at a roadblock on Saturday night. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s declaration last week that a `` state of war'' existed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and `` the attacks on our citizens over the weekend are several of the things which the president has cited which required us to move in self-defense,'' <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to seize <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial on federal drug charges. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> informed Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> of the military moves by telephone at 2 a.m. Wednesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is `` extremely concerned'' about the crisis, said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has repeatedly come before the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to complain of allegedly provocative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers that it said were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple the government. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> claimed during council debates in April and August that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to provoke confrontations in order to keep control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under a 1977 treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to turn over control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed Wednesday to begin reviewing the presence of 80,000 Soviet troops stationed here since the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring'' reforms were crushed in 1968. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> told reporters after returning from a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that a joint commission will be set up in the first half of January. The commission, composed of civilian and military experts, also will re-examine the political and historical events that led up to the Soviet invasion and its consequences, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said at an airport news conference. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON>, who has said he hopes an agreement can be reached soon on the withdrawal of Soviet troops, told reporters the commission would `` deal with all aspects of the Soviet military presence'' in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> was asked if there would soon be a timetable for a pullout of the troops, which have been stationed in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on a `` temporary'' basis for 21 years. `` I do n't know, but I think we will have results in this area that will satisfy the nation,'' <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> replied without elaboration. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had agreed to negotiate its troop presence in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, agreed to begin the talks in the first two weeks of next month. The dispatch did not say the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be negotiating withdrawal of its troops, but the Czechoslovak state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> has said the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country would begin preliminary negotiations for the pullout of Soviet troops. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said he met with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> for more than an hour Wednesday. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> met with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calfa </PERSON> said he left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the feeling that there was `` great understanding for this question.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who led the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring movement crushed by the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion in August 1968, signed the initial document allowing the troops' presence after tense negotiations in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, where he was flown right after the invasion. Since the ouster of hard-line communist leaders the last month, the new Czechoslovak leadership has said the agreement was invalid because it was signed under duress. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apologized for its hard-line policies of the past and for abusing its opponents after the 1968 crackdown. Earlier this month, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> condemned the invasion as a mistake. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has vowed not to interfere in the affairs of its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> also have apologized for their roles in the invasion. <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> sai before the visit that any troop withdrawals must run parallel with <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> talks on conventional weapons reductions under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where a preliminary accord is expected next year. Faced with a peaceful revolution, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> resigned Dec. 10 after swearing in the new government dominated by non-communists. Other hard-line leaders associated with the crackdown that followed the invasion have been ousted from power and purged from the party.

<TEXT>
 Opposition to President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is centered in ethnically diverse <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> and in the northern part of <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, both of which have stronger historical links to the West than the Romanian heartland that is <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s home. Periodic outbreaks of unrest have shaken <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> over the years, triggered by harsh living conditions in the <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation. In 1977, about 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the <LOCATION> Jiu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to protest <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s iron-fisted domestic policies _ policies that put an early chill on any form of organized opposition. The valley is <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s leading coal basin in rugged western <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. The miners demanded pay raises, more food on the shelves and improved working conditions. Faced with the first big wave of opposition since he became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in 1965, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> gave in to the strikers' demands Police, however, subsequently arrested and harassed hundreds of people who took part in that work action. Protest leaders disappeared under mysterious circumstances in traffic accidents. In November 1987, at least 10,000 workers demonstrated in <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, demanding freedom, more food and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ouster. The uprising was brutally put down by police and the army. In the most dramatic protest faced by the 71-year-old Marxist autocrat, hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of demonstrators were reported to have died last weekend in unrest in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, also part of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> and 500 miles from the capital <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. Security forces randomly shot into crowds of protesters there. Scenic <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, the city of flowers, noted for its many parks and trees, is the capital of the <LOCATION> Banat </LOCATION>, a region of mixed population containing Romanians, Hungarians, Serbs and Germans. It was on <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>'s main Liberty Square that the protesters were killed by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security forces. It was also on that square that <PERSON> Gheorghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Doja </PERSON>, leader of a peasant uprising in 1514 and a national symbol against oppression, died under torture. Like the peasants the protesters last weekend demanded freedom. They shouted: `` Down with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>!'' `` Down with the dictator!'' and `` Today in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, tomorrow in the whole country!'' in allusion to the spreading revolt that apparently has gripped the country, according to witnesses. In the other corner of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION>, close to the Soviet border, people on Wednesday were burning books by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Munteanu </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s writings had been prominently displayed in bookstore windows there. <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION> is an old cultural and historical center. French influence was dominant there, starting in the 18th century. Many sons from well-off families traveled to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to complete their education. They gradually formed the nucleus of an intellectual class, which favored French philosophy and thought and became receptive to the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and later trends. Hundreds of Romanian students marched in <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION> in January 1987 demanding better food and more heat in their cold dormitories. Industrial workers held several strikes there. <PERSON> Munteanu </PERSON>, an ethnic Romanian who lives in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, a former Romanian region annexed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1940, said he spoke with acquaintances in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and was told that pro-democracy demonstrations were going on in several cities. Southern <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, historically known as <LOCATION> Walachia </LOCATION>, lived for five centuries under the Ottoman Turks and has little democratic tradition. The historic development of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> was substantially different and more complex. The province benefited from comparatively higher cultural and political standards under the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the empire collapsed in 1918, when <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> was united with the Romanian kingdom. During its long experience under the <ORGANIZATION> Hapsburgs </ORGANIZATION> and Hungarians, <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> became intimately associated with the events in Central and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Opportunities for travel to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and cultural contacts that developed shaped the people's political awareness. As <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> stubbornly rejected reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries, the opposition found it could now learn something from its Marxist neighbors. By way of special TV antennas, it could pick up Soviet, Hungarian and <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> programs. Even in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, about 35 miles north of the Bulgarian border, the 2 million residents can watch Bulgarian television apparently unhindered. `` You ca n't keep Romanians isolated from the outside world, as <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> would like,'' a woman living in <LOCATION> Iasi </LOCATION>, six miles from the Soviet border, said. `` It's enough to have a TV or a radio set to be kept abreast of developments in the world.'' `` The virus of freedom is spreading anyway,'' she told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 About 150 people outraged by the reported massacre of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> protested outside its embassy here Wednesday, with some hurling stones and bottles of ink before being stopped by police. Police otherwise did not hamper the protesters, who lighted candles in the shape of a cross on the sidewalk outside the embassy, hanged protest posters on its wrought-iron fence and chanted `` Ceausescu Go Away,'' referring to Romanian Communist ruler <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, Rise Up,'' said one poster. A minute-long throwing attack by a handful of protesters left the white embassy walls mottled by black ink. At least one window was broken. The attack ended and the rally proceeded peacefully after a policeman ordered demonstrators to behave themselves. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gave a speech condemning <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for firing on its people during weekend demonstrations directed against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. In another development, the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> ambassador was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to hear complaints about `` brutal treatment'' of Polish tourists by Romanian border guards, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies, but relations with the hard-line communist state have been chilly since Solidarity took over the Polish government in August.

 Parliament approved a farm bill with only one dissenting vote Wednesday, indicating it will accept the entire government plan to transform <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s centralized economy into a market-oriented system. The vote of 284-1 followed more than two days of sharp debate, much of it critical of the government's agricultural policies, and represented overall support for reform beyond party lines. Industry Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Syryjczyk </PERSON> and the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osiatynski </PERSON>, said they felt the entire package would be approved. A finance official said a letter of intent on an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> agreement would be signed with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> soon. The Soviet bloc's first non-Communist government, led by Solidarity, is pushing economic reform in an effort to conquer annual inflation of 900 percent a burdensome $ 39 billion foreign debt and qualify for desperately needed Western economic aid. Officials acknowledge the program, which takes controls off prices, ends most subsidies and limits wage increases and will be painful in the beginning. It is expected to cause a 20 percent drop in real incomes and put 400,000 people out of work in a nation unaccustomed to unemployment. Before Wednesday's vote, <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said in urging support for the farm resolution: `` We are convinced that Polish farmers ... will be able to understand the interests of the state.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and the architect of economic reform, Deputy Premier <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON>, sat side by side in the chamber as the vote was taken. By Wednesday, three days after <PERSON> Balcerowicz </PERSON> presented the economic plan to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the government appeared increasingly confident of passage. <PERSON> Osiatynski </PERSON>, head the planning office, said: `` I think it will be voted in before the first of January. The difficulties will start only once it is voted in and once we start carrying it out.'' <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawicki </PERSON>, deputy finance minister, said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would sign a letter of intent with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> `` within the upcoming few days.'' After the letter is signed, <PERSON> Sawicki </PERSON> said, he expects the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to announce preliminary acceptance of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic reform program. He said that would allow <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to get a $ 215 million bridge loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and release a $ 1 billion loan pledged by a group of Western countries, led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to support turning the zloty into a convertible currency. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> is expected to ratify the agreement at the end of January or early February, <PERSON> Sawicki </PERSON> said. In it, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> agrees to continue a strict regimen of reform in exchange for a $ 700 million line of credit from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. Certification by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> would open the way to money from other Western lenders, including a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loan of $ 300 million, and rescheduling of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 40 billion hard-currency debt.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> declared a state of emergency Wednesday in the western region around <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, where security forces may have killed thousands of people in crushing anti-government protests. Tens of thousands marched through the city to demand the bodies of protesters, chanting `` Give us our dead!'' Reports said protests of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s iron rule had spread to at least eight more cities since the bloody weekend at <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, which is in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> only 30 miles from the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders and about 500 miles from the capital <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the last autocrat in the Soviet bloc, declared the emergency hours after returning from a three-day state visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Romanian state radio reported. It said an 11 p.m. curfew in the city of 350,000 and surrounding region applied to everyone except workers on factory night shifts and banned gatherings of five or more people. Soldiers, police and members of special militias were placed on alert, the radio said, without specifying what that meant. In a broadcast speech earlier, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> ignored international condemnation and said fascists and foreigners were fomenting unrest in his Stalinist land. He said soldiers fired warning shots Sunday in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> when threatened by `` hooligan elements,'' but did not mention casualties. `` The military units ... were compelled to defend themselves,'' he said, but were `` very patient'' and `` did not respond, even when soldiers and officers were hit.'' Few foreigners and no journalists could get into <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Reporters already there, including those from allied nations, were not allowed to travel freely. Eastern European reporters who tried to reach <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> were turned back 30 miles away, the Soviet, <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> and East German news agencies reported. <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> remained inaccessible to foreign travelers and telephone callers Wednesday. It also was impossible to telephone <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. A Yugoslav trucker said he saw graffiti daubed on walls in a <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> suburb early Wednesday, calling for `` an uprising ... against the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> regime on Dec. 24.'' He reported sporadic gunfire and from the direction of downtown <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. A Pole who reached <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> on Wednesday told the daily <PERSON> Mai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nap </PERSON> it was `` like a city under siege. I saw them tossing dead into the river. People told me over 1,000 people were killed.'' Dispatches from the Yugoslav and Hungarian news agencies said <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> was full of police and soldiers Wednesday, but that 50,000 people went into the streets nonetheless. Western businessmen who crossed into <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> said Wednesday's protest began at a factory in the morning. The businessmen said the people went to a stadium where they apparently believed authorities were keeping the bodies, chanting `` Give us our dead!'' No police intervention was reported by the businessmen or the Yugoslav news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> consul general in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, the Hungarian news agency, said some soldiers joined the demonstrators in chanting slogans against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. In a dispatch quoting Romanians working in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the official East German agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said unrest had spread to at least eight other Romanian cities and the death toll in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> could reach 3,000 or 4,000. Casualty estimates have risen daily since Sunday. No independent confirmation is possible because of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s isolation. Large numbers of soldiers and police were reported in the streets of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and other major cities, according to a Hungarian who telephoned five cities, and dispatches from Eastern European journalists in the Romanian capital. <PERSON> Mihnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Berindei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> spokesman for a group called <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, said some policemen entered hospitals to arrest wounded protesters. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said police burst into the Yugoslav consulate, the only diplomatic building in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, and seized demonstrators who took refuge there. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s Foreign Ministry would not confirm or deny the incident, which would be a violation of diplomatic conventions. In a report from the Yugoslav border with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said there was no more room in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> hospitals. The Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appealed for international help in searching for victims of the crackdown. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who has ruled <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> since 1965, delivered a 25-minute broadcast address after his return home, with his entire government and wife <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, the second most powerful person in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, lined up behind him. He sought to blame <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which he has accused of wanting to reclaim <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, where most of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians live. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> ruled the region for centuries, but it was given to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said earlier that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was not involved in the unrest. In his speech, the 71-year-old Romanian leader blamed the trouble on fascists cooperating with `` reactionary, imperialist circles and espionage centers.'' `` The aim of these anti-national, provocative actions was to provoke disorder and to create the conditions for the territoral dismemberment of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, of its independence and sovereignty,'' he declared. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has governed with increasing harshness in recent years. He has ignored international criticism of his human rights policies and enforcing industrialization and debt repayment programs that caused rationing and other hardships. Because none of his remarks dealt with those problems, which have created widespread discontent, it appears he will continue to rely on the army and legions of uniformed and secret police to perpetuate his regime. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, quoting unofficial sources, that `` a state of full alert has been introduced across <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as protests and unrest continue in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and other towns.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said unrest had spread to the other <LOCATION> Transylvanian </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION>, scene of a large anti-government protest in 1987; <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sibiu </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Constanta </LOCATION> and at least four other cities.

 The former head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that the military strike against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was `` well-planned and well-executed'' even though he has long opposed the use of force there. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 30, also said the operation would be judged `` a disaster, an absolute catastrophe'' if Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returns to power. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> had opposed military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, advocating diplomatic and other peaceful options to dislodge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The Panamanian leader has been indicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Various <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations failed to deal successfully with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, ultimately pushing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into a corner where he could do nothing except send in the military, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no other options. It had reached a point where an American was killed,'' he said. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for the military strike to protect the lives of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and ensure freedom of movement in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Although he did not have inside knowledge of the military operation, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said it appeared from news reports that it was handled professionally and competently. `` The military operation looked well-planned and well-executed,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, adding, however, that it apparently took longer than expected. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> described <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as `` a clever, clever guy.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operation wo n't be considered successful unless <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is either captured or driven from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and never returns, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. He said he did not think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would call off the operation until it was certain that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could never return to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Bomb-sniffing dogs and squadrons of police provided tight security Wednesday as a crowd of mourners paid their respects to a federal appeals judge killed by the first in a series of mail bombs. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was filled to overflowing with more than 700 people who were asked to put aside their anger over the slaying long enough to remember the contributions of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. Dogs searched the church before the service, and dozens of officers kept watch during the 35-minute program of scripture, hymns and a eulogy. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, a member of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was killed instantly last Saturday when the bomb exploded in his home, propelling nails into his lower abdomen. His wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>, was injured in the bombing and remained hospitalized Wednesday. A similar bomb two days later killed a civil rights lawyer in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, City Alderman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. A package bomb was found in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> courthouse including the 11th Circuit on Monday and a fourth mailed bomb was removed Tuesday from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. All four targets can be linked to school desegregation efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, leading investigators to speculate that a white racist group may be responsible Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war on various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the bombings, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bombs and threats has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> to boost security at its offices, executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said Wednesday at the organization's national headquarters in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Hooks said he's convinced the bombs were the work of white supremacists who feel threatened by recent victories for blacks in courtrooms and at the polls. `` I think it's the work of white supremacists, without any question. I think it reveals the derangement, demented, criminally stupid minds,'' he said. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> are denying any involvement. `` There ai n't nobody in any white supremacist group got sense enough to make a bomb,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> grand dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm hoping if it's one of those big drug dealers, maybe they'll take credit for it and get the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> off our backs. <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> was one of several defendants who had appealed a $ 950,000 jury verdict against two Klan groups for pelting civil rights marchers with rocks and bottles in <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The 11th Circuit refused in October to rehear the defendants' appeal. At <ORGANIZATION> Vance </ORGANIZATION>'s service, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, a close friend of <LOCATION> Vance </LOCATION>, delivered the eulogy, asking the mourners to `` put aside our outrage for awhile'' to honor <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. `` The assassins were cheated if they thought that <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was afraid to die,'' <PERSON> Fulford </PERSON> said. He described the 58-year-old <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> as a strong believer in the law and a man `` who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed.'' `` No wonder his assassins could not stand such a man in their presence.'' Friends of the <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> family said his remains have been cremated and his ashes will be placed in the church. Because of the rash of bombs, and the attendance of public officials, the church, south of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, was surrounded by police barriers and cordoned off with yellow tape. Among those who attended the service were Sessions, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the justice who oversees the operations of the 11th Circuit, which handles appeals from <LOCATION> Floria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

 Here is the transcript of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation conducted Thursday afternoon. <PERSON> PETE </PERSON> <PERSON> WILLIAMS </PERSON> -LRB- Defense Department Spokesman -RRB-: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We have an update for you on the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And here to speak to you are two experts. The person who will answer most of your questions is Gen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who is the Director of Operations for the Joint Staff. And also with him is Admiral <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheafer </PERSON>, also of the Joint Staff, whom many of you have met before. I know you have a lot of questions. Our main purpose here today is to update you on the situation on the ground in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> has been following this moment by moment since it began last night. So he is very familiar with the details and has been at it the whole time. And we'll go for about half an hour or so. General? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: It's very nice to be here, and I appreciate the opportunity. What I would like to do is show you what our forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have done during the day. The Chairman briefed you this morning on the point at which we had arrived then. Operations have continued; they have gone fairly well for us. We'll start out here in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> where the two infantry companies were. You might recall that the infantry companies were instrumental in putting down the coup on the third of October, therefore they were considered to be very loyal. The Rangers went in, took them out; that's been completed. They took their arms room. They got 250 prisoners, roughly. The rest fled. And that's a problem we're having in a lot of areas, in that much of the PDF -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is fleeing in the face of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military units. That presents us with a dilemma: Are they, in point of fact, going to go into the jungle or the woods and represent a force in the field? Or are they going to resolve on a life of crime and use their weapons to just raid the people? Are they going to lay their weapons down and go back and try and get a job and participate in the hoped for economic prosperity? We do n't know that That's one of the things we've got to be watching and one of the things we have to do. Over here in the Task Force Semper Fi area everything is pretty quiet. All of the PDF resistance within that area has been reduced. As you may recall; there was never very much in the first place, although I ca n't guarantee you again, because this is a big open area with a lot of vegetation, that there are n't some people out there. Let me just sneak out here a little bit. -LRB- Moves toward map. -RRB- Up in the <LOCATION> Task </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> area, everything up there has been reduced. First, the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> elected not to fight very much in the first place, and the naval infantry company, which did fight, has been reduced. Therefore, the situation is calm up there. We used one battalion to do that, and as you may recall, another battalion came down into this area, <PERSON> Punta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, where there's a housing area and a prison, and protected the housing area and unprotected the prison; went to <PERSON> Cerro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tigre </PERSON>, where there's an electrical distribution grid, and secured it; and went to <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>, possibly the most chief facility along the canal, because as you know, that's the water that's used to fill the locks that make the canal functional. If we lost that and the dam had to be rebuilt, I've seen estimates where it could take a year or longer to fill back up.

 Q: General, can you try and talk into the microphones? GEN. KELLY: Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Why do n't you move that map back a little? The map is my security symbol and my lesson plan. Of interest is that the Canal is functional. There has been no endeavor that we've uncovered to try to destroy it. We have forces out along it, and we intend to protect it. It was actually worked somewhat today. Some ships were moved out. And we are hoping as early as tomorrow we'll be moving other ships through the canal, so that's a real plus for the effort to date. I would say things up in the <LOCATION> Task </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> area are in pretty good shape. We'll skip <PERSON> Task </PERSON> <PERSON> Force </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayonet </PERSON> now and go out to what we're calling <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, and that's the one that's built around the 82nd Airborne Brigade, which jumped in last night They have gotten organized, moved out. They have attacked the cav squadron at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Viejo, or engaged the cavalry squadron, and reduced it; there is no longer any resistance there. They have engaged the infantry company at <LOCATION> Finajitas </LOCATION> and reduced it; there is no resistance there. They have engaged the Battalion 2000, another anti-coup unit from the 3rd of October, and found nothing when they got there. Actually an R & amp; S team out along the bridge on the <LOCATION> Pacora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last night called in airplanes, AC-130s, and they knocked out nine of their vehicles, which I think is a pretty good portion of their vehicles. And the rest fled. And we've been seeing the PDF fleeing from our troops in most of the engagements, with some exceptions: the naval infantry up here, at least initially the two companies at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, although eventually they fled. So it looks like the organized resistance in these areas is pretty much a thing of the past. The organized resistance in the Task Force Bayonet area is also a thing of the past. We were going into the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION> this afternoon with a Ranger company to go through it room by room, and we found it empty. We have completed sweeping all of the buildings at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> is now secure, although there is some shooting down in this area. We have established a refugee collecting point at <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>, and as of mid-afternoon, had about 1,000 people in there. And refugees are becoming a problem. But I think it's fair to say that the _ and our plan was to go after the organized combat forces of thePDF first in this area from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> on out to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION> in the East. That's where the preponderance of them are. That's where the preponderance of the power of the PDF is. We went after them first. We have reduced them. And there is no organized resistance left in those areas, although there are people left in those areas. There are also a number of Dignity Battalions in those areas, primarily in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and that has got to be our next priority, to get in there and to begin to clean that out. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, as you know, is a city of almost a million people. Urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind. They might compete with the relief in place in the dark, but they're right up there in the degree of difficulty in terms of military operations. It's a large city to sweep through. It's going to take a lot of people. That's why we are anxious to get the 7th Infantry Division brigade in tonight and anxious to get the 16th MP Brigade Headquarters and those two companies in. Two companies does n't sound like much, but that goes _ they go with the other MP companies already in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. I believe there's five of them So it'll represent about a brigade of MPs.

 People who march to a different philosophical drummer in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> can find liberal camaraderie to the beat of such old instruments as sacbuts, lutes, krummhorns, cornettos and viola da gambas. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ancient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> brings in groups reviving the old inmstruments and period music, providing social gatherings for many who may not feel comfortable at traditional Southern black-tie affairs, Academy President <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> says. The academy formed in 1981, evolving from elaborate Thanksgiving weekend birthday parties for the late civil rights activist <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Borinski </PERSON>. `` It was kind of the one place where liberal <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could meet,'' said <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Tougaloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> chemistry professor, of the Borinski parties. <PERSON> Borinski </PERSON>, who died in 1983, was a Polish-German Jew who fled from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1938 and had taught sociology at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s historically black <ORGANIZATION> Tougaloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> since 1947. He is credited with initiating many academic forums across the state during the 1950s and 1960s where both blacks and whites met to discuss civil rights issues. The former German judge also served as undergraduate mentor for a large number of black lawyers including <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s only black <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice since Reconstruction and the first black to graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Borinski would always have a birthday party just after Thanksgiving. It was in a very European style,'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> recalls. `` He would have a little party for his friends from the college and so forth, other friends from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. In fact, actually it was a lot of civil rights people. ... `` One time he was at an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> auction and he bought an evening of music from <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- choir master. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> wanted to play ` Shadow of Your Smile' or something like that all night on the piano _ but here's a college professor, so he figures he'd better do something serious. So he brought some music over that they were doing at St. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Borinski </PERSON> liked the very old music which <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> played and a month before his next birthday, he told <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> he'd like to have a similar performance again. <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> called on <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Garriott </PERSON>, a tour guide and professional musician in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> who is now vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ancient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>. `` I knew <PERSON> Max </PERSON> had composed some Baroque-style music for parties. So he wound up composing special birthday music for <LOCATION> Borinski </LOCATION> _ some of it adapted from Baroque music and some of it original,'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said. The parties grew, with 250 to 300 people at <LOCATION> Borinski </LOCATION>'s 80th birthday in 1981, he said. The birthday parties were `` one of the crazy things that led into all this,'' he said. `` And it kind of kept that little group of people together'' who now support the ancient music academy. <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garriott </PERSON> said their group is now funded by various grants from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and other public and private sources. It is host to performances by about four professional groups each year, with audiences averaging about 200. Most of the performers come from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because it is in the forefront of the growing revival of historically authentic performances on period instruments, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is often the groups' only Southern stop on their American tours. `` We present music from 1200 to 1800 _ 600 years worth of music. And if you go to one concert and do n't like it, or if you do like it, it does n't mean you'll react the same way to the next one, which may be completely different music,'' <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> says.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apologized Wednesday for its hard-line policies of the past and for its abuse of opponents after the 1968 crackdown on reform. Its leader said the once omnipotent party is nearly bankrupt. At a key party congress, the party also elected to leadership roles two men distinguished by their acceptance of the opposition, including <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, who initiated official negotiations with opposition leader <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON>, the former premier, was chosen party chairman. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, former chairman of the Communist youth group and another main figure in talks with the opposition, was elected first secretary. The apology was the first of its kind to the <LOCATION> Czechoslovak </LOCATION> people, who in the last month have come together in a peaceful revolution that ended the Communists' monopoly on power. `` The Communist Party of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> apologizes to the Czechoslovak people for its past policies,'' said <PERSON> Evzen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prusa </PERSON>, a top party official who spoke on national television on the first day of a the congress. `` It also apologizes for the events following 1968 and for expelling and harassing the innocent,'' <PERSON> Prusa </PERSON> said. All the leaders installed after the crushing of the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms have been ousted from power the past month, and the party recently condemned the Soviet-led invasion that ended the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring. The party now is maneuvering to try to make the best showing possible in free elections expected by July. In his opening address to the congress, party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> lashed out at former and present party leaders for `` serious'' political mistakes that he said caused the party's fall from power. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said that as a member of the ruling Politburo, he also was to blame for allowing hated hard-liners to remain in the top ranks. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said the `` party leadership manifested negligence and irresponsibility worthy of punishment'' for not ousting officials such as former <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> and others sooner. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> and former party boss <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> were accused of being politically responsible for a brutal police crackdown on peaceful student demonstrations Nov. 17 that ignited the popular revolution. Leaving <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> on the Politburo was `` an extraordinary, politically serious mistake,'' <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> have since been forced from power. They denied accusations by a parliamentary commission that they were responsible for the November brutality. <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> said the party faces bankruptcy, disclosing that party dues were used to build recreation facilties for top brass `` about which the rank-and-file only learned today.'' Detailing the crisis facing the party, <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> noted that it had lost 66,290 of its 1.7 million members in the last month. About 1,000 new members have joined, including 143 people purged from the party after the 1968 invasion who were recently rehabilitated, he said. The speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds itself following the triumphs of the pro-democracy movement. `` I'm aware things wo n't be easy in the future,'' <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> told the delegates in his acceptance speech, adding that he took the job out of a feeling of responsibility to correct past mistakes. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> resigned as premier this month after failing to form a government acceptable to the opposition. As party chairman, he is responsible for external party policy, including dealing with other political forces. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, the first secretary, handles internal policy and administration. <PERSON> Lubos </PERSON> <PERSON> Belka </PERSON>, representing the reform Communist Democratic Forum at the congress, asked party leaders to renounce their privileges `` so Communists can regain the lost trust of the nation.'' `` Communists must no longer work in velvet chairs, but must return to where they came from,'' he said. It was not known how many delegates at the congress support the reform movement. But a spokesman for Democratic Forum indicated during a news conference that the congress seemed about evenly split between hard-liners and reformers. About 40 delegates from the reformist group were invited to attend the congress as non-voting guests. Democratic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevratil </PERSON> told the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency his group was not allowed to participate in discussions and charged they had been invited to give the impression of democracy within the party. Also among the non-voting guests were former party members expelled in the wake of the 1968 invasion.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recommended Wednesday that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> become stronger economically before considering reunion with its rich and powerful neighbor. At the end of an emotional visit to the East, he also discounted fears of a `` Fourth Reich,'' an increasingly used term that raises the specter of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who arrived in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for a three-day official visit hours after <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> returned to the West, cautioned against changing borders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` For the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it would not be good _ indeed it would be very dangerous _ to reopen the issue of the existing borders,'' he said. Before returning to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said `` the economic potential of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> must be strengthened'' before reunification became a possibility. He said he expected a treaty expanding relations to be completed before <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s first free elections, scheduled for May 6. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, in an interview with East German TV before leaving <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said relations between the two German states have `` very special characteristics.'' He was the first head of state or government of the three western World War II Allies to visit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Aides said his trip should not be viewed as recognition of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as the East German capital, which the Western Allies reject. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> still have authority over <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as a result of postwar occupation of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who spent two days in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said at a final news conference his government would address the concerns of other European countries as the two Germanys move closer together. `` It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live together, but we all know it can not come immediately,'' he said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s parliament scheduled a session for Jan. 11-12 to debate a new travel law and legislation to promote joint ventures with Western companies. A draft law providing alternatives to military service for conscientious objectors also will be on the agenda, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION>, a West German newspaper, said another passage through the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall would be opened Friday at the historic <LOCATION> Brandenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, a symbol of German unity. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> agreed at their summit Tuesday that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> woulds open a pedestrian crossing at the gate before Christmas and would lift travel restrictions for West Germans on Christmas Eve. They also signed several agreements and pledged to negotiate a treaty bringing them closer together, especially by expanding economic links. In a commentary Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the summit was a success, but `` anyone who hoped'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> would arrive `` with a sack full of <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> gold rejoiced too early.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters inter-German issues that could be discussed soon included improving traffic connections and solving joint telecommunications and pollution problems. `` We will have to work intensively'' on a common German currency, he said, and acknowledged that as `` one of the most difficult questions.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the aim of a common currency was to allow West Germans to buy goods in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> restricts such purchases because state subsidies make many goods much cheaper than in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and shortages are feared. In a sign of the rapidly increasing economic links, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced Wednesday the first joint venture with a West German firm had been signed. A compact disc manufacturing plant is to be built by the <PERSON> Pilz </PERSON> company, based outside <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, and the East German state conglomerate Robotron. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a working group of both nations on promoting tourism held its first meeting. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will support reform in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and `` not only talk, but act.'' He pledged, however, to avoid `` destabilization,'' an apparent reference to the power vacuum created by the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control over the past two months. Addressing the concerns of neighboring countries, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said: `` Fears based in the past are understandable, but there is nothing to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk about a Fourth Reich.''

<TEXT>
 A two-day conference of foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> gets underway Thursday despite misgivings discreetly expressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The initiative for the unprecedented meeting came from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, current chairman of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, to give a new impetus to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s exchanges with the Arab world. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has taken a critical view of the idea, conference sources reported, because it would exaggerate the importance of the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, which is preparing to create a single European market among the 12 by 1992. Furthermore, the Americans dislike the idea of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> _ with which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no trade relations _ participating fully and dealing on equal basis with the members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous. They said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and some Arab countries close to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ notably <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ dragged their feet on taking part in the meeting because of the American misgivings But all 12 members of the Community and the 22 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> finally decided to participate for fear of being isolated within their groups. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the conference, said spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shubb </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was seen as the most reluctant Arab participant because of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s military intervention on behalf of the government of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> against Libyan-backed rebels, as well as the French decision to renew the ban on shipment of French-made arms to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The government of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> decided to participate `` only at the urgent request of its Arab brothers,'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency said The first steps to creating an `` Arab-European dialogue'' were taken in 1973 when the oil crisis had brought the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to the high point of their power. The earlier attempt collapsed largely because of political problems, including accusations of terrorism against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. For the current conference, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> government has reoriented the agenda more toward economic matters. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is concentrating on a selected list of specific to avoid getting bogged down in political subjects, such as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to challenge the export of citrus fruit from the Israeli-occupied territories to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> The agenda includes such items as agreements on trade in petrochemicals, the exchange of consulting engineers, an Arab-European financial convention, European aid to the North African railroad network and preparatory work for the proposed fixed link _ by tunnel or bridge _ across the Strait of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 And then the command-and-control capability that the brigade headquarters gives us should give us an ability to thicken the forces in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and to get in there tomorrow and do some good work. I would point out to you that most of the paratroopers, and most of the soldiers and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> who went into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, have at this point been awake for three days, and they're pretty tired. You know, they marshal the troops a good 18 hours before they get on the airplane. They fly down, which is not a lot of fun because we tend to fully book the aircraft, and then the most comfortable thing they do is to step out the back door. And when they get on the ground, of course, they're using up their adrenalin and they're nervous. And so, they're just flat tired. We will be doing some work tonight and we will be doing some work every night every night. But I think that the progress has been reasonable, understanding that the operation has not been going on yet for a full day. The command and control, in my own opinion, has been excellent. The chain of command is short and effective from the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to the Commander-in-Chief in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to the field commander, who is also the Commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. And everybody in the country who carries a gun works for him. I'd be happy to address some of your questions now. Q: General, how _ the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> situation _ how many troops in _ that's the <LOCATION> Montes </LOCATION> _ de los <PERSON> Machos </PERSON>? GEN. KELLY: The Men of the Mountain are the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infantry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. Q: Yes _ how many of them escaped? I mean, what kind of forces _ GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: Hard to say, because we think only about a half of them were there in the first place. They had some of these folks _ and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>'s the expert on that _ but they were at the Comandancia. They had a real mixed bag of people at the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION>, protecting it. It seemed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, in his latter days as dictator, liked to keep moving people around to keep them loose. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, do you want to add to that? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: Half the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was up at the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION>. Q: At the <LOCATION> Comandancia </LOCATION> down at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: At the Comandancia. You've got 250 at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> _ is that right? GEN. KELLY: 250 detainees _ yes. And if that was half the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> _ excuse me _ most of the 6th Company, we got a pretty good slug of them, I would think, and I would n't think more than about 75 _ ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: We have n't had a chance to go through all of the detainees yet, and get an order _ Q: Good intelligence _ but you think you got a number of them at the Comandancia? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: Yes. Q: General, what can you tell us about the hostage situations? What can you tell us about the different hotels that house Americans that apparently the troops have had trouble getting to? What is the situation, and why have the troops had trouble getting to these hotels? GEN. KELLY: We now have a clear understanding of the importance of getting to the hotels. We do n't plan to tell you how we're going to do that, because we do n't want to help those who are possibly around the hotels. Incidentally, in some cases people are isolated in hotels, but they're not hostages because they're not being held by anybody. Our original strategy was to attack the PDF and to break its structure down. I think we've pretty much done that. Now, we'll move in with much greater force into the built-up areas of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in order to be able to protect the Americans and other people who are there Incidentally, we do n't have an effective police force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> either _ a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> police force _ one of the things we would hope to get re-established fairly quicky. Just let me add one thing. We know of no Americans who've been killed as the result of any of this. Q: General _ Q: General, can you tell us, is there an ongoing hostage situation there? Are you aware of hostages? How many do there appear to be? How much of a problem is it for you? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: We have reports of hostages. Some of those reports seem credible. None of those reports have been verified by our military. And I think I'll ask <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> to add anything to that that you would choose.

ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: We've been trying to track each of the hostage reports, and we have probably almost a dozen. And we have great difficulty with the information we have in corroborating any of them. They vary in numbers ranging from the lows of two or threes, to the highs in the teens.

Can you walk us through why that apparently failed, at least in its initial stages. Were you in the right place? Was he in the wrong place? GEN. KELLY: Ahhh. He was obviously in the right place. He's a crafty devil, as you know. He grew up in a very tough academy, so he's been used to this for many years. He allegedly changes his place of residence about four times a night. We had him spotted several times during the day. We thought we had a pretty good idea where he was last night. We went there and he was n't there. Q: Where was that? GEN. KELLY: I would _ I'd prefer not to say because he may go back there and we may want to go back there again. But, we're looking for him very hard Of course, that's all contingent on intelligence. And what I meant to say when `` we had all the spigots turned on'' is, we are turning on all our looking, listening, and hearing devices to see if we ca n't pick him up. Q: When you say _ excuse me for interrupting you, General. When you say that you spotted him several times today, are you suggesting to us _ GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: Not today _ I said yesterday. Q: Yesterday. You're suggesting to us, though, that you're not far away from him, that you expect to capture him. Can you make that kind of commitment? GEN. KELLY: No, I ca n't. You would probably have to ask my boss for that kind of commitment. But, I'd just tell you we're going to try as hard as we know how to try to help Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> get a plane ride up here. Q: General _ Q: Sir, have you spotted him at all today _ since this attack began? GEN. KELLY: Have we spotted him today? No, we have not. He has gone underground. Q: General, one of the other missions _ stated goals for this mission was to provide greater safety for Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Especially in view of what you just said, you all do n't where some of these PDF forces have gone _ off into the jungles, or they may re-emerge in urban areas. How exactly has this operation improved safety for Americans? And what kind of safety are you going to provide on the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? GEN. KELLY: First, I had also said, we know of no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> yet who has been injured as a result of this operation with the exception of one American dependent which I think you know about who was killed yesterday. Second, we said we have a concern that they have gone off into the jungle. We do n't know for a fact that that's what they've done. If they have gone off into the jungle, I think there's every chance that we'll go off after them. I think that by tomorrow you'll begin to see a greater presence on the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. One of the main reasons that we went down with the size force we're going down with, and it's very substantial, is to protect life and property. And our goals, when we went to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was to keep the Canal open, to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives, to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> property, and to prepare _ to help the Panamanians re-achieve democracy. Q: Do you think Americans there now are safe today? GEN. KELLY: In the main, yes, I do. None of them have been hurt.

<HEAD>Life Terms for Three Palestinians in Fire Bomb Deaths</HEAD>

 A military court sentenced three Palestinians to life prison terms Wednesday for a firebomb attack on an Israeli bus that killed a rabbi's daughter, her three children and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, the army said. After sentencing, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers tried to assault the prisoners and turned on journalists as they left the court, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. No injuries were reported. Last week, the court in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> found <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Takruri </PERSON>, 22; <PERSON> Jumaa </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbish </PERSON>, 19, guilty of causing the deaths by throwing firebombs at the bus as it passed through the biblical town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It found the attack to be premeditated, and also convicted the men of preparing firebombs in three prior instances. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> was given two years beyond life because of a two-year suspended sentence for an earlier conviction. The attack occurred on Oct. 30, 1988, two days before national elections. It was thought to have given a last-minute boost to rightist parties such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which urged tougher action against the Palestinian uprising. There had been expectations the three would be sentenced to death after military Judge Lt. Col. <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapira </PERSON> said last week the court was not bound by the prosecution's request for life sentences. The army prosecutor, Capt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachar </PERSON>, said at the time a request for the death sentence was rejected in consultations with high-ranking authorities. The only person ever executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminal <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, who was hanged in 1962. Chief of Staff <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said at the time of the attack that it was `` spontaneous'' and ill-planned. `` It was a group of guys who were sitting around at night playing cards and decided to throw a firebomb at a passing bus,'' he said. The three were said to have hidden in a banana grove and hurled firebombs through the open windows of the passenger bus traveling from <LOCATION> Tiberias </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a 27-year-old school teacher, and her sons <PERSON> Netanel </PERSON>, 3, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>, 2, and 9-month-old <PERSON> Efraim </PERSON> were burned to death. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Delarosa </PERSON>, a soldier who tried to rescue the family, suffered severe burns and died later. On Oct. 30, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> court handed down the stiffest sentence of the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli rule, giving a Palestinian 16 life terms for forcing a passenger bus off a cliff and killing 16 people. At least 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the revolt, and 43 Israelis have been slain. Another 161 Palestinians have been killed by their fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as suspected collaborators with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A regional humane society is investigating charges that a county dog pound has been burying alive unwanted dogs and cats, officials said Wednesday. A number of people reported seeing animals squirming in the back of a pickup that was taking animals to a landfill for burial. However, <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials are denying that the animals, which were supposed to have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, were alive when buried. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who works at the landfill office, said she was working Tuesday when a truck filled with animals in plastic bags from the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Dog Pound pulled up. `` I saw movement in the back of the truck,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` At first I thought it was the wind, but then I noticed it made a teepee effect, like a paw reaching up.'' The driver, who was outside the truck to obtain papers from Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s office, `` swatted the bag with the back of his hand,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` Then he pulled up two other trash bags as if he was trying to cover it up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockrum </PERSON> said the animals were checked before they left the pound in <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>. The board oversees the pound. `` When we destroyed animals yesterday -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- morning we had a veterinarian to check each and every animal and he assured us that each one was dead before they left the pound,'' <PERSON> Cockrum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> of <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he and his two sons examined four dogs they found at the landfill. `` One of them my boy picked up and it gave out a pitiful whine and then it went limp in his arms,'' he said Wednesday. The other three animals were warm and limp and appeared to have been dead only minutes, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cockrum </PERSON> called the reports by Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> hearsay. About 45 animals are destroyed every two weeks at the pound. They are put in steel boxes linked to the exhaust pipe of a vehicle and are asphyxiated with carbon monoxide, <PERSON> Cockrum </PERSON> said. The carcasses are dumped at the landfill within two hours of death, including the 45-minute ride from <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cockrum </PERSON> said 28 animals were killed Tuesday, including eight or nine cats. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said he found another dog barely alive in October and asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> to perform an autopsy on the dog. Dr. D.K. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> confirmed that he performed the procedure at the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Centralia </LOCATION>. The autopsy found that the dog had been alive about three hours after it was buried, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. It also found that the animal's organs were severely burned from inhaling carbon monoxide, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dantzler </PERSON>, regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said asphyxiation with carbon monoxide is an `` extremely painful'' method of euthanasia. The most humane and least painful method is lethal injection of barbiturates, he said. <PERSON> Dantzler </PERSON> said his offers to the county for help in finding a more humane euthansia system were ignored. The society plans to investigate the matter further, <PERSON> Dantzler </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home in South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In another time, another president said he would not see the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made into `` a pitiful, helpless giant.'' The phrase echoed as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops to crush and capture Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose Panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sanctions short of force. Part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours on Wednesday with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declaring that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been removed as the strongarm leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his loyalist forces. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> called him a fugitive, and said he would be tracked and taken, to stand trial on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments. For more than two years, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had taunted and incited the giant, while his foes at home and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tried futilely to dislodge his grip on power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose watchword is prudence, said it was an enormous frustration. But he took it for nearly a year, for lack of an acceptable alternative. Then he took a risk, and went to war. `` Fellow citizens, last night I ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he told the nation Wednesday. `` I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were in grave danger.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gained prompt and predictable support at home, from Democrats as well as Republicans. He had briefed congressional leaders just before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces went into combat against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s loyalists in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Defense Forces Presidents seldom face much political dissent when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces are in combat, especially with the kind of provocations <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> provided. His puppet assembly had declared a state of war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and an off-duty American officer was shot and killed by his forces on Saturday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted the killing, the wounding of another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman, the capture and beating of a third and threats against that man's wife. `` That was enough,'' the president said. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and to bring Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had repeatedly encouraged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents to kick him out of power. He had said that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was the problem, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' quarrel was with the general alone and that his ouster would bring normal diplomatic and economic relations. Yet when dissident officers attempted a coup on Oct. 3 and briefly held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, American forces stood by, inactive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders, but the administration decided against intervention. That drew protests from left and right, although some Republicans complained that dovish Democrats who opposed intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders had been told they could offer support for the coup `` if there were an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life and to do so without open military involvement.'' Those instructions ring with irony now that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have been sent into open combat. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> recalled his October testimony, and the administration explanation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inaction at the time of the coup attempt. `` I said if this administration chose to use force, it would make its own decisions,'' he told a news conference. `` It would not act based on some unknown coup plotters' strategy or rationale.'' The toll of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers killed in action early Wednesday mounted into the teens and scores were wounded. That is the price of using military power. It was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use, 19 years ago. `` If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world,'' he said, announcing he had sent forces to attack Communist North Vietnamese sanctuaries in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sure to hear told-you-so comments from those who argued the administration should have sent forces to join the October coup. And <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s purge of dissident officers after that coup could make it more difficult for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to quickly complete operations and withdraw the additional troops, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wants to do as quickly as possible. The newly installed government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ led by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, thought to have won the May election <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled _ will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in place of his henchmen. Stability under an elected government will be the real test of success, whatever happens to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The administration has been wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle. American intervention puts that to the test: If the theory is correct and he is powerless, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is irrelevant. But if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and running continuing operations against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, the administration will have a major problem on its hands. When President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces into action in the 1983 invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and the 1986 air raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the operations were swift and brief. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to be a mission accomplished and quickly ended. Prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at home and intensify the inevitable Latin American resentment against <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> intervention, no matter the cause. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out swiftly, by lifting economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under the new <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, and by promising anew that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials made plans Wednesday for the possible extradition of embattled Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the event he is captured, but his attorneys said he would rather die than surrender. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be flown to a military base in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and transferred to a secure location to await trial in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on federal drug charges, said a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But his attorneys said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was in hiding Wednesday as more than 20,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stormed through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, may never be captured. `` He's a fighter,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, who said he talked with his client Monday evening and remained in contact with the general's aides Wednesday. `` I feel unhappily secure in my belief that he will be killed, he will not be captured. Should that occur, the truth will never come out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> refused to release details about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s possible extradition or where he would be detained, citing security concerns. `` If General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is apprehended and brought here for trial, he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused of a crime _ no more, no less. All his rights will be protected,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON>, the trial judge in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 16 associates face federal drug-trafficking indictments returned by grand juries in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> in 1988. He would be tried first on the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> charges, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Another <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, echoed the sentiment that the general would never allow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to take him alive. `` The general is alive, well and somewhere in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and he is on top of the situation, as far as leading his forces,'' said <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, who predicted the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would lead to more bloodshed. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s declaration Friday of a state of war as a reason for the invasion, but <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> vehemently denied the general ever declared war on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys had agreed to publicly resign if he declared war, and closely examined a copy of the text in which he apparently made the declaration, <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said. `` What was said by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and by the national assembly was that because of events, the country was living as if they were in a state of war,'' he said. `` We were satisfied that he had never declared war on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` No one, no matter how strained the context, could consider that a declaration of war,'' said <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, acknowledging that he did not know if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had departed from his prepared text in his speech to the assembly. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said the drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were politically motivated. `` Before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in a covert way to topple governments. Now they are using indictment diplomacy,'' <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said. Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who brought the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indictment against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and now practices law in <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, said the military dictator is just another criminal. `` The indictments were not instigated by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and they were not brought for any political purpose whatsoever,'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said. `` All this yammering about indictment for political purposes is pure hogwash.'' A trial is scheduled Jan. 8 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for two of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s co-defendants, but prosecutors had requested a continuance before Wednesday's actions because they need more time to prepare their case `` The government will come to court with strong evidence against General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, the former chief assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who presented the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment to a grand jury in February 1988. In the two indictments, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is charged with accepting $ 10 million in bribes from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION> drug traffickers to protect smugglers and cocaine shipments, launder cash and supply drug laboratories. He faces up to 145 years in prison and more than $ 1.1 million in fines if convicted. `` If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s not rounded up soon, he could probably go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, or he could start up a guerrilla movement with all the arms he has stashed away,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, a cousin of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A legislator was convicted Wednesday of spying for communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Judge <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Suk-je </PERSON> dismissed Rep. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>'s claims he was tortured to make false confessions that he was a spy for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s archenemy. `` It was hard to find evidence to support the claims of torture, considering the confessions signed by the defendant during an interrogation by prosecutors,'' <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> said. The sentence had been expected to be heavier, but the judge said the breakdown of the Cold War was taken into consideration. The defense counsel criticized the verdict as improper and said the ruling would be appealed. The prosecution, which had sought life imprisonment for <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, also said it would appeal. The maximum penalty for espionage is death. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> had told the court that during a 50-day investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, the government intelligence organization, he was forced to make false confessions that he had spied for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said he had been denied contact with lawyers during the period and kept awake for many days. Government officials denied the charges. Also Wednesday, riot police firing tear gas stormed a university campus in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to break up a rally by hundreds of students demanding the release of Im Chong-suk, a jailed radical student leader. About 700 students throwing firebombs and rocks fought police for two hours in and around <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the third day of campus protests. Several students were taken away by police, but no figures were available on arrests or injuries. Im was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide anti-government, anti-U.S. organization. The spy case was generally considered the most serious in recent South Korean history because it involved a national lawmaker with ongoing contact with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> admitted he visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> but denied he was a spy. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, a farmer-turned politician, was convicted of espionage and `` leaking state secrets'' to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The judge said overwhelming evidence indicated <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, 52, secretly visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> last year, received $ 120,000 from communist agents and had ongoing contact and communications with the communist nation, all in violation of the National Security Law. The judge also ordered <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> to forfeit $ 49,000 in unspent funds, allegedly from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The judge, in handing down the sentence, said, `` It was taken into consideration that international trends have turned from the Cold War era to an atmosphere of reconciliation since his -LRB- Suh's -RRB- visit to the North and the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government has been pursuing an active Northern policy'' aimed at easing tensions. He said the state secrets leaked by <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were not sensitive but said <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> contacted <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before his 1988 election to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, as well as after. After <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s arrest June 28, a dozen lawmakers, businessmen and aides were questioned or jailed by national security agents. Two-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, leader of the leading opposition <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted for allegedly failing to report <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> denied it and <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was expelled from the party. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Pang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang-kyun </PERSON>, was convicted of being an accessory Wednesday and sentenced to seven years in prison. Six others were given suspended sentences ranging from 10 months to one year for failing to report <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, as is required by law.

 Investigators probing mail bombs that killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer are examining anonymous letters mailed last summer that threatened the federal judiciary, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The letters, which surfaced in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, may be an important clue in the FBI-led probe of the two fatal mail-bombs in the South, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` We are examining those letters to try to determine whether or not there is a link between those threats in August and the matters at hand today,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The bombs killed Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, alderman and civil rights lawyer. Other parcel bombs were found at the 11th Circuit court in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> office The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says it believes all four similarly packaged bombs were mailed from locations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The bombs were similarly constructed of nails and explosives, authorities say. Television stations in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> received letters bearing Aug. 21 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmarks. That was the day before a tear-gas cannister was thrown into the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, injuring eight people. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> refused to discuss the contents of the letters but he said they were similar in content. The ones received by WAPT-TV in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> WITI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> were titled `` Declaration of War'' against the <ORGANIZATION> 11th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. according to copies made available by the stations. They threatened poison gas attacks on heavily populated areas `` until widespread terror forces the court to adopt the impartial and equitable treatment of all as its highest priority.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the investigation is concentrating on racial motivations for the killings and the bomb incidents. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said investigators are checking <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s court docket. The director said he would n't be surprised if a decision <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> once made motivated the killing. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> ruled in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 15 in a school desegregation case. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said all four letters were examined last summer by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> crime laboratory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but yielded no physical clues such as fingerprints. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshals in the various jurisdictions where the letters were received were told of the threats, he said.

<TEXT>
 Moldavian delegates, worried about their ethnic brethren in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, asked the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to appeal for `` reason and order'' there. <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Drutse </PERSON>, a well-known Moldavian poet, said the Stalinist regime of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> might embark on a new wave of repression against Romanians seeking greater democracy. `` It would cost him nothing to build his palace of the skulls of his subjects,'' <PERSON> Drutse </PERSON> told a reporter in the lobby of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Palace of Congresses. Anti-government protests began last weekend in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, a city of 350,000 people in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Estimates of the number of people killed by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security forces reach the thousands. Soviet <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>, a small repubic of about 4 million people, is on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s eastern border. Moldavians are essentially ethnic Romanians whose territory has gone back and forth, last falling into the Soviet sphere during World War II. The declaration proposed by the Moldavian legislators expresses hope that `` all problems will be solved in the framework of reason and order'' and through dialogue between the Romanian government and population, <PERSON> Drutse </PERSON> said. Moldavians said they asked the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leadership to put the declaration up for a vote, but it had not been done by Wednesday evening. <PERSON> Drutse </PERSON> said he believed passing the declaration could help ease tension in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> because every `` tyrant is afraid of something.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has made no move toward intervening in its ally's affairs. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said Wednesday a `` massive flow of information'' made it hard to judge what was happening in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, but if reports of loss of life were confirmed, `` this is a reason for profound regret.'' Official media have taken a critical tone toward <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s Stalinist regime

 Specialists refloated a grounded oil tanker on Wednesday and traffic resumed in the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, canal officials said. The 138,536-ton Liberian-registered Lauberhorn had just begun its northward passage from <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> when it ran aground in heavy fog just north of the city Tuesday morning. At least 109 ships had to wait for the east-west passage to be cleared. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that after about 10,000 tons of crude oil were taken off the Lauberhorn, the tanker was refloated at high tide at 2:50 p.m. Canal traffic was resumed at 11 p.m. They said the tanker was towed to <LOCATION> Zenobia </LOCATION> area, near <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, which is at the canal's southern tip. The grounding caused a crack in the bow up to nine feet long, leading to a minor spill from the 73,000 tons of crude the ship had taken on at an Iranian terminal in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ezzat </PERSON> <PERSON> Adel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s director, said the spill had been cleaned up and the crack sealed.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration argued Wednesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was legal under both domestic and international law but some lawyers who have tried war-powers cases disagreed. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> cited Article 51 of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Charter that gives nations the right to act in self-defense and a similar provision of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> treaty as the legal basis for the invasion. Article 21 of the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> treaty gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to protect its citizens, installations and institutions, the secretary said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also cited the terms of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaty that give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the right to exercise force to protect the canal to keep it operating. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> advised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the legality of the operation before it was launched, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` believes there is a legal basis for this action being taken under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` It is my understanding there is clearly legal authority under both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law and international law.'' But two attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal New York-based civil liberties group, disagree. ` I'd say it's clearly illegal under the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> Charter and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> charter,'' said attorney <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON>, who is also a law professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't have the right to unilaterally decide to overthrow another governent by the use of force,'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said. `` Nothing that the president said today or the secretary of state said would give the the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> such a right.'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must show it is acting in self-defense for the invasion to be legal under the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> Charter and the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> treaty. `` I do n't think that can be based on some speculated threat that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens might be endangered,'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had cited an intelligence report that Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> was poised to attack Americans. `` If <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens might be endangered, the obvious thing to do is to protect them and evacuate them not overthrow the government,'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, another attorney for the center, said the invasion also violated the war-powers provision of the Constitution, which requires congressional approval of the deployment of troops in this fashion. `` I think the intent of the framers of the Constitution is clear, if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to offensively use military force abroad it must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not by four leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON> said. `` As a purely technical constitutional matter, the president does not have the authority to do what he did,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` As a matter of legal and political reality, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't try to stop him, I think it's unlikely the courts would.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> voiced caution about the invasion, saying `` the rationale of protecting the securityof the canal must be limited to making sure there is no damage to the canal or some impairment of the security of the canal.'' `` It ca n't be an all-purpose justification of wide-ranging actions to restructure the government,'' <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Koh </PERSON> also expressed skepticism about justifying the invasion as an effort to arrest <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` As a matter of international law, there is a danger in converting political action into so-called crime fighting action.''

 Civil rights leaders said Wednesday they've made progress in this northeast <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> city, but the mailing of a bomb to <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters recalls recent racial tensions that had begun to fade. The bomb disarmed here Tuesday was similar to devices which killed a federal appeals court judge and a <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, civil rights leader. Bombs mailed to the 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and to the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People were disarmed without causing any damage or injuries. Possible links to <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> school desegregation efforts have been identified in all four cases, leading to theories that a racist group may be responsible. Racial tensions were heightened here in September when three black City Council members were ordered arrested after they walked out of a meeting to protest lack of funding for predominantly black areas in the city budget. One of them, attorney <PERSON> Deitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Micks </PERSON>, was arrested in a City Hall women's room and hauled back to the council meeting in handcuffs. The arrests were ordered by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Tillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, who is white, so the council would have a quorum. `` And all of a sudden this happened, so it just brings up this whole issue of race again,'' the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a black minister, said Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> is sitting on a racial powder keg, I'm sorry to report.'' Black leaders said they were angry about Tuesday's discovery of the bomb, but it will not deter them from their work. `` We will go on with our business as usual. We will not let this incident stop us from doing the job we have set out to do,'' said <PERSON> Willye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the local president of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. She received the explosive package Monday, but did n't have time to open it then. She had a more optimistic view of racial tension in the city. `` We've come a long way in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, but we have a long way to go,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who is white, said he believes tensions have eased since the walkout. `` But there are elements on both sides who can point to certain events and say improvements are superficial,'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization has received criticism from both whites and blacks for its positions. `` On one hand we have threats from whites, perhaps racists, who want to destroy us because of positions of ideology ... and on the other hand, to try to stop drugs we have threats from blacks who happened to be drug dealers who want to blow us away,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that all four bombs had <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> postmarks or return addresses. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON>, in charge of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office, said the first parcel bomb, addressed to federal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, was mailed last Thursday from <LOCATION> Newnan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> was killed and his wife was seriously injured. The bomb that killed <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> alderman </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> on Monday is believed to have been mailed Friday from <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON> said. The bomb found in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> also was mailed Friday from <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION>, he said. Another bomb was mailed Saturday from the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> clerk's office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hinshaw </PERSON> said. The investigation is concentrating in part on possible links to <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> school desegregation efforts: _ The 11th Circuit hears federal appeals from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, including desegregation cases. _ <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, an 11th Circuit judge, wrote the court's September ruling in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in its desegregation suit against <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> schools. _ <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s local counsel and helped with an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> suit against the Savannah schools. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> lost that case at the 11th Circuit, and the three-judge panel did not include <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also had advised the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter in its desegregation case, according to a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> activist, the Rev. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Newbill </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bush Says Military Strike `Decapitates' Noriega From Dictatorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he ordered the military strike in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to seize <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and end `` reckless threats and attacks'' against Americans. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> eluded capture and the administration put a $ 1 million bounty on his head. Even though <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dropped out of sight, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said, `` As a practical matter, we have decapitated him from the dictatorship.'' The White House announced a $ 1 million reward for information leading to his capture. In addition, Panamanians were offered $ 150 for each firearm they surrendered. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials declared the operation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a military success, saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces mostly had fled or were fleeing though some fighting continued. Reaction from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both Democratic and Republican, was mostly favorable. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, hoping to break a nearly two-year stalemate with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, dispatched 9,500 soldiers and Marines to back up the 13,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops already in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for a 1 a.m. assault against army bases and the general's headquarters. In a televised address from the Oval Office, a somber <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the nation, `` I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens were in grave danger.'' In the fighting _ codenamed `` Operation Just Cause'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> _ 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were killed, many more were wounded and one was missing. In addition, a woman dependent was killed, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Four helicopters crashed, believed to have been brought down by gunfire. Noting the loss of American lives, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` No president takes such action lightly.'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> deputy chief of staff, said, `` One dead American is too many, but thank God the numbers do n't appear too high right now.'' He said, `` It looks like the organized resistance is a thing of the past.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, up much of the night, monitored the fighting in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He took a break Wednesday evening to attend a White House Christmas party. Some Americans were reported taken hostage in the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Late in the day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines arrived at the site and escorted many Americans out of the building. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` a crafty devil'' and said he had not been spotted Wednesday. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces had observed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> several times on Tuesday. `` We thought we had a pretty good idea of where he was last night. We went there and he was n't there.'' `` He has gone to ground,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Even so, he expressed confidence <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be located, saying `` we have every spigot turned on'' to find him. He said there was no indication <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The general said `` much of the PDF -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is fleeing in the face of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military units.'' He added, `` We have a concern that they have gone off into the jungle. There is every chance that we will go off after them.'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he expected the canal to reopen Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would withdraw its force as soon as possible. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he could not speculate how long <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would remain in action. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was roundly criticized when he kept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces on the sidelines during an unsuccessful coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on Oct. 3. In contrast, congressional leaders generally supported the president's decision to use force. `` When there is the engagement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the field, it behooves all of us to give that support,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` It was made necessary by the reckless actions of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. But Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action `` a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy'' which violates the Constitution And, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should not have acted without the support and aid of other Central American nations. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the director of national drug control policy, said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` I think we can safely conclude that this ends his career as a drug trafficker. He's not running drugs. He's not running <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> He's just running. And that's good.''

 The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> met in emergency session at the request of <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, a holdover from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime. He told the gathering, `` Under no circumstances will we accept some supposed leaders who are puppets imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' referring to the provisional government headed by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and recognized by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in a letter to recognize <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON> as his designated representative but the members decided to recognize <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, instead. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> withdrew its ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in protest `` until the invading troops withdraw,'' according to a statement from the Peruvian embassy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, laying out the reasons for the military action, cited <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s declaration last Friday of a state of war, the slaying of an American officer last Saturday and the manhandling of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> serviceman and his wife. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` As president, I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. `` And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and bring Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' With <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the run, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was lifting economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and freeing Panamanian assets frozen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided Sunday to use force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. After that decision was made, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> received intelligence reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might launch a commando attack against Americans in an urban residential neighborhood. While saying it was unclear whether the report was reliable, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters that if Americans had been killed or terrorized, `` you would be asking us today, ` Why did n't you act to prevent this kind of violence against our citizens.''' The secretary added, `` I'm not going to tell you that the crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been totally resolved. ... But <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was yesterday's ` maximum leader' is today's hunted fugitive.'' Ever since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to force him from power through economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> condemned the action, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` must immediately stop its armed intervention.'' British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> praised it as `` a courageous decision'' and said, `` Someone has to uphold democracy.'' Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had unsuccessfully tried to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` There comes a time when a president must take action. That time has come.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the planning for a military strike `` had been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I was briefed on'' when he took office last spring. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` As a practical matter, we have decapitated him from the dictatorship of this country and he is now a fugitive and will be treated as such. ... We will chase him and we will find him.'' At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suggestion, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called the two newly installed Panamanian vice presidents, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, to congratulate them and say he looked forward to visiting them in a free and independent <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said a spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is considered likely to attend a presidential inauguration in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on Jan. 27, and sources said a visit to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> then is under consideration.

 And the people who were there who may harm them know that we're present and we're armed and we'll come after them Q: General, do you plan to get dependents or other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now? GEN. KELLY: Not immediately. We have not implemented any plan along those lines. Q: General, with some of your goals accomplished, are there any thought _ is there any thought being given now to withdrawing some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops? GEN. KELLY: My boss indicated, I think this morning, that there were no timelines, that we were going to stay there long enough to get the job done. I do n't think I see this as a long, long-term effort, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, combat troops for months or years, but I think that it's going to take a little while to help the country get back on its feet. You've got to realize they've gone through an awful time over the last couple of years with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has done a great deal to break down the social fabric of the country, and we've got to try and help them rebuild it. Q: General _ Q: Can you give an update on casualties _ an update on casualty numbers? GEN. KELLY: Yeah, I can. Okay, we've lost so far four helicopters, but three of those four will probably be _ and this is an assertion on my part _ repairable, and the fourth one, if we get it back _ it's in the water _ may be. And that was one Apache and three observation helicopters. We have had 11 military people _ one <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, I believe, the rest soldiers _ killed, 59 wounded, and one missing, and I mentioned the one dependent who was dead. You know, one _ one dead American is too many, but, thank God, the numbers do n't appear too high right now. Q: Do you know how many of those were accidental, General? GEN. KELLY: To my knowledge, none of them were accidental. Q: General, on a scale of one to ten, how successful would you say this operation has been so far? GEN. KELLY: Oh, ten. And you're asking the wrong guy. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- I think that it is among the most professionally executed operations that I have seen in 33 years of military service. Recall that the _ that the so-called war status was declared on Friday, the Marine was killed on Saturday, the family beating and harrassment occurred on Saturday. We made a decision, and in almost no time at all we were putting our paratroopers and our Rangers on airplanes and sending them down there. I do n't know that there's another country in the world that can do that. I do know that I'm a pretty biased guy when it comes to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, and I think that we have the finest leaders we have available running things in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Q: General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, following that if I could sir, in the aftermath of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, can you tell us, do you have any reports yet of perhaps communications gear that could n't communicate back and forth, men dropped in the wrong place, those kinds of problems repeating? GEN. KELLY: We have indications that human beings in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have made mistakes, you know, history is replete with that. As far as major glitches are concerned, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and I have been on the _ in the <ORGANIZATION> NMCC </ORGANIZATION> on the communications. There has never been a second that we have n't had direct voice communications with the commander and his staff. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, there's never been a second that they have n't been in communication with Gen. <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Commander, JTF South, Joint Task Force South And, no, we have not had those kind of glitches. Q: Did you have any problems with any kind of weather? GEN. KELLY: No, no. We had weather problems, of course, up in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> trying to get out yesterday. We had an ice storm, and we had one heck of a time getting the airplanes de-iced, and we had problems out of <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> today with fog; that slowed us down getting out. Q: General, on that point _ GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: But we still made the TOTs -LRB- Time Over Target -RRB-. Q: _ would you like to have started this operation sooner? Would you like to have had it conducted sooner than one this morning? GEN. KELLY: If you could wave a magic wand and get the MAC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- aircraft together and do all those kinds of things, I would like it to have started just the second the President said we could go. We were in a position where we had to tell him that it takes so many hours to get that many airplanes together, because they're all around the world, and we do n't have an excess number of those aircraft. Q: General _ Q: General, on the amount of equipment we've thrown into this fight in the way of planes, tanks, helicopters, what force, in addition to manpower, are we actually bringing to bear here? GEN. KELLY: Reasonable force. I am a tanker. We have four tanks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and they're Sheridans, which, as you may recall, are light vehicles that have a 152mm gun and were originally designed primarily to fire a Shillelagh missile. They came out of the 82nd Airborne Division, and that's the only TO & amp; E battalion in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> left with the <ORGANIZATION> Sheridans </ORGANIZATION> because the M1 tanks are too heavy to be air-dropped.

 Q: Were those flown down yesterday? GEN. KELLY: No, they went down sometime earlier. We also had six Apache helicopters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. That is a modern day-night all-weather helicopter that represented a real combat multiplier. We had some gunships, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> AC-130 gunships, and other capabilities down there, all of which stood us in very good stead. Q: General, how many casualties from that air drop? Did we take any? GEN. KELLY: I know of no casualties that occurred as a result of the air drop. Q: That's a pretty hairy thing, though, to drop, what, 20 planes' worth of airborne at night? GEN. KELLY: Oh, no, there was a whole lot more than 20. We would n't want to give you the exact number. No, 20 aircraft came out of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. A whole lot more came out of other places to carry the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. Only the airborne from the 82nd came out of <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. Q: Well, how _ well, give us a little better idea of that landing zone and everything, what happened there. I mean, this was _ did you light the area with -LRB- the strips? -RRB-? GEN. KELLY: Yeah, they landed right on <LOCATION> Tocumen </LOCATION> airfield. You know, that's nice and wide and open and all that. Q: General, what kind of problems do the Dignity Battalions pose for you in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> tonight? GEN. KELLY: That's hard to say. You're asking me to predict the future, and that's really an intelligence question, so I'll turn it over to my colleague. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: Could we ask you, sir _ ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: We've had _ there is some _ about 18 Dignity Battalions. They vary in size from as few as a couple of dozen people up to about 250. Their military training is generally pretty inadequate. Q: Inadequate? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: Inadequate. They're great with people who are unarmed, but when it comes to fighting uniformed soldiers that are well trained, they're not very good. And they are throughout many parts of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at this time. We have seen activity principally between the areas that General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> mentioned, <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> in the west, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION> in the east by about roughly nine of these 18 battalions. And we have seen nothing out of the other nine. Q: Sir, General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was telling us in the _ when he was outlining the other units that were outside, and speaking of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> forces, that there was a great deal of fleeing in the face of the Americans. Does your intelligence suggest that will happen in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>? Or are you expecting to get into a rough street-to-street _ ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: I'll answer _ Q: _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- _ which could lead to more casualties. ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: I'll answer the question the same way he did. You're asking me to predict the future and that's very difficult to do. We simply do n't know. Q: _ like the rebellion for urban fighting when you said _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB-. ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: I mean, you have to plan for the worst, and hope for the best. Q: Are these guys armed? Are n't these more unarmed rebels? What kind of weapons? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: They have _ in this case we have reports that some of the Dignity Batallions have been armed _ Q: What kind of weapons? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: With RPGs and AK-47s. Q: Can you give us an assessment of the difficulty it presents to you that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is still at large? The difficulty in terms of stimulating the remaining pro-Noriega _ ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: I do n't think that's the right question. The right question is the difficulty he has staying at large. Q: But you do n't feel that having him at large presents you with a different magnitude of problem because of what he represents? I mean, as you yourself have said, he's a slippery fellow and _ GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: He is, and right now Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands nothing. He has no payroll. He has no cronies except for possibly a small group of people who are loyal to him personally because he pays them. He does not present us with a military problem. His soldiers did not fight any more bravely over the past day because he was there or he was n't there. I think now that the structure of the PDF combat units has been reduced he is in deeper trouble. I do n't think he's deeply loved by the Panamanian people I do n't think _ I do think that if they _ they get an inkling of where he is they're going to _ they're going to let us know where he is or let the authorities in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> know where he is, because recall, that they're the ones that did all the suffering while he was the dictator

 <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, sworn in Wednesday as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion, remains a gentle, unassuming law professor despite his long struggle with his enemy, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s eight-party opposition coalition united to oppose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in elections held on May 7. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters first tried to steal the election for his handpicked candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, then annulled it.

He said that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops would be removed as early as possible. Opposition party officials persisted in calling <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> `` Mister President-elect,'' maintaining that the annulment was illegal. After Sept. 1, when <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> would have taken office, he was referred to as `` Mister President,'' and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials followed suit. The staying power of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s opposition has always been questioned _ <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said they just wanted to make money in peace and would fold under serious challenge. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and his two running mates, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, formed an uneasy alliance whose only unifying theme was the defeat of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was by far the most popular in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but he was also the most disliked by others. He clearly felt he deserved the presidential domination but swallowed hard and took the first vice-presidential slot. Second vice-presidential candidate <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, a businessman, turned out to be the most charismatic of the three, showing an earthy, common touch despite his wealth as he developed a showman's style. One problem the three will have to surmount is the way they took office. Many who disapproved of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will also disapprove of open, massive <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervention, and critics say depending on `` Big Brother'' to solve all problems is a sign of weak character. The three stayed out of sight all day Wednesday. Their statements were broadcast on a radio network anchored by <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallarino </PERSON> from `` a strategic point in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' It was thought the point had to be on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base because <PERSON> Vallarino </PERSON> is a well-known <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponent and faced censure from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters. It was still uncertain how the tensions and compromises will work in practice, but <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his running mates established their willingness to sacrifice when men wearing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s `` Dignity Battalion'' T-shirts beat them during a May 10 protest demonstration. The spectacle of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> being beaten bloody by pipe-wielding thugs flashed around the world in a scene that stamped <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the leader of a brutal regime. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed. `` They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied guayabera, a short-sleeved, smock-type shirt favored by many Latins. He staged a hunger strike that occasioned brutal jests about diets from pro-Noriega newspapers because of his heft. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s opposition activities date back more than two decades, to when he served in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s grand old man of the opposition. He was <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' spokesman in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> until <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1988 in self-imposed exile. He used to speak, almost dreamily, of the day when <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> would return `` as a sign of providence'' to lead the country. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>, died earlier this year. They had a daughter, also named <PERSON> Marcella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, 52, is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was a professor of philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>; he and his wife <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> have three children. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 53, and his wife <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> have two children.

 Two American women were held hostage at gunpoint in an airport terminal for more than six hours before they were freed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soliders who bluffed the Panamanian captors into believing that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been killed. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, told reporters they were used as shields to buy time for a group of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customs room at Omar Torrijos International Airport when American forces moved in. `` They had us in choke holds for most of the time,'' said <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON>. `` They made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to her head,'' said King. The two women said they had gone to the airport Tuesday evening to pick up <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON>'s brother, who was flying in for her wedding ceremony at the end of the month. They were told his flight was delayed, and went outside to wait in the car _ until about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday when the bombs started to drop. Dashing inside the terminal, the women were accosted by a group of about 30 armed men in civilian clothes. When it was revealed the women were Americans, they were taken to a locked room. `` A guy named <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was in charge,'' <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON> said, adding that two other men were addressed throughout the night as `` sarjinto,'' or sergeant, leading the women to believe they were members of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. American troops began to arrive in force to take over the airport but the Panamanians held them off with the women. `` For six hours they made us keep shouting, ` Go away. We're Americans They're going to kill us and the children if you come,''' <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON> said. Fake bombs were taped to their bodies. One was a plastic bag stuffed with a pair of pants. King said their captors turned the lights off in the room to confuse the Americans. <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> kept an Uzi machine gun on her shoulder, pointed at the door. The woman, who were both raised in the canal zone, acted as translators between the Americans and Panamanians. Just before dawn, the Americans set a deadline of 6:30 for the men to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was already dead. In fact, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s whereabouts were not known. The Panamanians finally gave up, leaving the room with the women held in front of them. `` They were really afraid. We could feel their hearts on our backs as they held us,'' <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON> said. But the women said they were at least equally frightened. `` We were terrified,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` I thought I was going to die.'' <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON>, speaking on the airport tarmac before hitching a ride with a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> press pool, said she was acting calmly because `` it really has n't hit me yet. I just really want to get home.'' <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON>, whose father is the chief mechanical engineer for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, said she planned to hold a church ceremony in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 30. She was married to <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebhan </PERSON> in a civil ceremony in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 Youngsters calling <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> over the past week may have been thinking of his sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, but they got the people who keep 530-mph, four-engine military radar reconnaissance jets in the air. And most of them will never know they got the wrong number. The children got connected to technicians at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s support center for specially equipped military aircraft. `` This was quite a surprise when it started out,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, developer with the Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, fleet support system. `` But after the first several calls we figured out what had happened, and just started answering phones as if this was Santa's workshops. Hundreds of children got their lines crossed because of transposed numbers in a telephone listing in a national magazine, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulham </PERSON> said Wednesday. The aerospace branch of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> specializes in missiles, spacecraft and spy airplanes _ for some, the ultimate toys. He said the calls began about Dec. 13 and were winding down by the middle of this week, after calls for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> were redirected. The first youngsters might have been greeted with, `` Hi. This is AWACS Fleet Support Central. Can I help you?'' <PERSON> Pulham </PERSON> said. But the engineers lightened up and played along. `` They were putting on their bonnets, and would play <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> whenever the children would call, but they would give technical information when customers called,'' he said. The normal phone calls to the center are for technical assistance provided for those who fly, service and repair the AWACS aircraft, which are loaded with sophisticated radar and other surveillance equipment. There are only 60 such aircraft in operation built by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pulham </PERSON> said, and the toll-free phone line is normally not busy. The engineers did n't mind the distractions. `` It was actually kind of fun,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said. `` Definitely a break from what we normally do. Although I think some of our customers were a bit surprised when they called for radar or computer information and ended up talking to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s workshop.'' <PERSON> Pulham </PERSON> said the situation did n't get out of hand, no matter what the children might have asked for. `` We did n't promise anybody any cruise missiles or anything like that for Christmas,'' he said.

 For two days, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> masked his plan to oust <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with a studied show of business-as-usual. He gaily greeted guests at a White House Christmas party just hours before the full scale military operation began. Outraged at the slaying of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and concerned about quickly deteriorating conditions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided on Sunday to mount the assault to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime, administration officials said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been seriously mulling such a strike since the abortive Oct. 3 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, officials said. In fact, the plan for a preemptive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> actually had been developed months earlier. Sources said one of the first to learn of the go-ahead was Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> briefed at a brunch on Sunday. The president went over final plans for the assault at a Tuesday afternoon session with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Secretary of States <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Oval Office meeting, in keeping with the secrecy shrouding the decision, was billed by White House officials as a sssion between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on `` the role of the military in the war on drugs.'' In keeping the decision so closely under wraps, the onetime <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief was following a familiar pattern of secrecy _ one also reflected in his sending clandestine high-level missions to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and in keeping private for four months his plan for a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> superpower summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended White House Christmas parties both Monday and Tuesday evenings, buoyantly greeting guests and posing for photographs. At Tuesday's party, Scowcroft, his deputy <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> all put in brief appearances before returning to their offices to wait for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike. A day after he made the decision to use force in an attempt to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to rule out a military response in a Monday interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and other news agencies. He expressed `` enormous frustration'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s continued strong-arm tactics. But otherwise he gave no hint at what was to come. The business-as-usual theme extended to other administration officials as well on Tuesday. Public information officers at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> went home at their regular quitting time. And, in the White House, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was joined by a small group of reporters in his office to watch evening network news accounts of unannounced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop movements to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he knew nothing about the reports. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Wednesday said the harrassment of Americans in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is what finally persuaded the president to use force. `` The president was somber through the night -LRB- Tuesday night -RRB-, worried about the possiblity of casualties, and anxious for any word of specific military progress.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> watched <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s announcement of the action on the television in his study near the Oval Office, then made notes on a 5-inch by 7-inch blue notepad as he talked to various world leaders by phone, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled virtually all of his scheduled events and meetings on Wednesday so he could concentrate on the action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, receiving frequent military updates through the day and evening. One event he did not cancel, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, was yet another Christmas party scheduled for Wednesday evening. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cheney </ORGANIZATION> told reporters that the order `` went out late on Sunday to implement a plan that had been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I was briefed on when I became Secretary of Defense last spring.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, suggested a concern that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might do something to jeopardize the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in the absence of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike. And a congressional intelligence source cited reports in recent months of a deterioration in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s mental health and heavy drinking. In any event, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, criticized in some quarters for being indecisive and timid in failing to capitalize on last October's coup attempt, apparently was determined not to let another opportunity pass <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> informed congressional leaders by phone of his plan about an hour before the first shots were fired. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> phoned him at 11:15 p.m. `` He said he'd appreciate my support.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he gave it to him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stayed in the Oval Office until 4:05 a.m. EST, spending much of the time phoning allied and Central American leaders to let them know what he was doing, before heading to his personal residence for a brief sleep before his 7 a.m. address to the nation.

 It may be the news-by-satellite era. But when the major networks began coverage of Wednesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> shortly after midnight, the reports from their correspondents there came by phone. The reason: Gunmen loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriegia </PERSON> barred them from a satellite transmission, network executives said. No pictures of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack's results or street scenes in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were seen until after 9 a.m. EST, and then they were on tape, not live. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> got embroiled in a small war of its own _ complaints from <ORGANIZATION> WTN </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based TV news agency serving <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had aired nearly four minutes of <ORGANIZATION> WTN </ORGANIZATION> footage without permission. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that was inadvertent, and that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> told viewers the same thing. But <ORGANIZATION> WTN </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyte </PERSON>, in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, protested `` in the strongest possible terms'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s action, calling it a `` cynical breach of professional standards.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> officials said, all four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> networks shortly afterwards agreed to pool their <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> footage. By mid-morning, the networks simultaneously were airing long-distance night shots of military buildings burning, white tracer bullets shooting occasionally shooting skyward and shadowy gunmen on streets. The networks also aired early daytime shots of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters landing, two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 transports flying several thousand feet above <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> paratroopers, faces daubed in dark green camouflages, taking positions near trees, signs and parks. At times, the war on TV took on an Alice-in-Wonderland quality. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, interviewing a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> resident by phone on the `` Today'' show, asked him what local broadcasters were reporting. <PERSON> Eloi </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said he was watching reports of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> TV station, which also carried <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> asked if the station was describing what was going on on the ground in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Well,'' <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> said, `` they're actually relaying the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> broadcast.'' It was a risky story for correspondents _ <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> used a stringer, <PERSON> Berta </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON> _ and producers. Some among the crowd of journalists at the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> reported that gunmen waiting outside had threatened them, made it too dangerous to leave the hotel. Four men thought to be <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists seized two network producers in the hotel lobby. They later released one, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, several hours later, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said it was checking unconfirmed reports that the other producer, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyersohn </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, also had been freed. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabel </PERSON>, reporting from the <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, fled to a nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installation after gun-waving `` goons'' threatened his life, according to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON>, running <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s operation here. `` They said they did n't want him or any other gringos around, that if they found him the next time they came around, they'll kill him,'' <PERSON> Angotti </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operation against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was accompanied by a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news pool that included <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, pool reporter for the networks. One of his reports, shown on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, included a discussion with <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> of what he'd seen. The reporters were flown in on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transports, but not early enough, one <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> executive said. `` We stll do n't have information why the pool did n't go in with an early wave -LRB- of soldiers -RRB-, or why they were held back ... until pretty late in the game,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Decesare </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' vice president for news coverage. The pool system was developed after a controversy over the ban on reporters accompanying the initial phases of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1982. This group's TV gear included a portable satellite ground station. But even though reporters were flown around the battle areas in helicopters, it appeared late Wednesday afternoon that unexplained snags had developed and there'd be no pool pictures from the transmitter, <PERSON> DeCesare </PERSON> said. `` They have the capacity to feed -LRB- video reports -RRB-,'' he said. `` However, we still have yet to receive anything.'' He and his <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> counterparts were relieved when, at about 35 minutes before their networks' first evening newscasts, the pool's videotape footage began coming in from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Some shots were taken over a the shoulder of a helicopter door gunner.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> used language reminiscent of the Cold War on Wednesday to denounce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attack in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Leaders from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> generally opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move but said it had to be done. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was one of the few heads of state who fully supported President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempt to capture Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Someone has to uphold democracy,'' she said. Angry condemnation came from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> announced he was withdrawing his ambassador from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> called a military alert and asked for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said the assault made <PERSON> Nero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> look like angels. He met the Soviet ambassador and gave him a letter for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on the invasion, asking <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to `` live up to its international responsibilities,'' <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Filipino congressional leaders on Thursday asked President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to recognize the `` democratically elected government'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was sworn in as president after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops went in. On Dec. 1, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets flew air cover to help the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government fight off a coup attempt. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said of the invasion, `` This action is an example of notorious ` gunboat diplomacy' which has been used for decades by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an attempt to turn Latin American and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations into its back yard.'' Despite Soviet anger, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> played down the impact on improved superpower relations. `` We are now in a situation where an event in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is not perceived, is not evaluated, in terms of confrontation between East and West,'' <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action violated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charters and `` should be condemned by the international community ... -LRB- and -RRB- must immediately stop.'' The 12-European <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> did not issue a joint statement. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is the current president of the community and a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said there were no plans for a statement. The French government said it could not approve of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` recourse to force'' but that it nonetheless backed the fight against drugs and supported democratic movements everywhere. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she had spoken with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the phone and told him her government supported him. `` Someone has to uphold democracy, there were terrible things happening in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It was a tyranny,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. `` It was a courageous decision'' to send in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops, she said. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. In angry exchanges later in the House of Commons it accused Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of humiliating <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> by supporting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action set a `` dangerous precedent'' but expressed sympathy. `` What would you have us do?'' asked Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` Here you've got a drug runner and thug running the country. He declares war on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He assassinates some innocent American citizens.'' Among other Western allies, the Dutch government said it also sympathized with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, which has close ties throughout <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` deeply lamented'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> summed up many reactions by saying it opposed the intervention but also opposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime. During a meeting of regional leaders in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> blamed a `` lack of an effective and firm response by our countries'' in the past for the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has tried to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down, convened an emergency meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at which the Panamanian delegate, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, called on the group to condemn the `` brutal and criminal aggression.'' `` It is not possible, while <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> citizens are still being massacred without distinction of age, sex or status for this organization to keep its arms crossed,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> made no overt comment. Its official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> issued brief reports that said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` safe'' and would `` fight for the nation's sovereignty.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was noncommittal. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> he hoped the confrontation would end soon and a democratic government take over in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in an editorial prepared for Thursday's editions `` it is highly questionable that the global community will buy'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> explanation for its action. `` The difference in strength between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is like that between an elephant and an ant. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not be surprised if its advance into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is regarded by the rest of the world as a blatant invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s independence and sovereignty.'' In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, official <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to replace <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with a government acceptable to itself `` so as to continue its domination over the -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> -RRB- Canal and its arrogant hegemony over central and south <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who has been accused by official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the past of promoting international terrorism, said of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action, `` I could not find any expression in the dictionary to describe the degree of anger toward the savagery of official terrorism and powermania.'' He said the assault makes `` Nero and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> angels compared to the western Mongols and Nazis of the Americans and their allies,'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was staring down the barrel of his own revolver, held by a 16-year-old who threatened to kill him after being stopped for speeding, when a passerby intervened. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Basey </PERSON> stopped his car, grabbed the assailant, pulled him off the policeman and then found himself facing the cocked and loaded gun. <PERSON> Basey </PERSON>, a 40-year-old window washer, was one of 20 people honored Wednesday by the Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for risking their lives attempting to save others.

When <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> stopped to apprehend the boy, the youth turned on the motorcycle officer and fell on him. The boy pulled <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s .38 - caliber pistol from `` He put the gun right to my left eye and he said he was going to kill me,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. Then <PERSON> Basey </PERSON> arrived. `` Mr. <PERSON> Basey </PERSON> walked right up in the face of that gun that could have gone off at any time,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` I believe Mr. <PERSON> Basey </PERSON> saved my life.'' <PERSON> Basey </PERSON> talked the 16-year-old into releasing the gun, and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> handcuffed the boy and arrested him. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> suffered only a sprained knee and scrapes. Also recognized Wednesday were: _ <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, 16, of <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, who saved a man who had fallen from a boat and severely cut his hands on the propeller on Oct. 9, 1988 _ <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who died saving a co-worker who was overcome by gas in a sewer shaft on Sept. 6, 1988 _ <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Viscusi </PERSON>, 58, <PERSON> Howick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, a nurse who died trying to save a woman who suffocated in a home for the elderly that had caught fire on July, 25, 1988 _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRiviere </PERSON>, 18, <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who died while swimming to save a man caught in an ocean current on July 30 _ <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benfield </PERSON>, 27, <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who nearly drowned pulling two young boys out of the ocean after they had gotten into water over the heads on June 14, 1988 _ <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theroux </PERSON>, 65, <LOCATION> Chepachet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, who pulled a man from his burning auto before the vehicle became engulfed in flames on Feb. 18 _ <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorne </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, 25, <LOCATION> Magdalen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, who drowned while helping to save a 13-year-old girl in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> on Aug. 21, 1986 _ <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 35, <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who leaped into a moving car to save a 2-year-old girl on Sept. 23, 1987 _ <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 35, <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, who drowned while saving a 12-year-old boy who had fallen from a dam into deep water on May 27 _ <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, 13, <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, who crawled into a burning house and dragged an elderly woman to safety on Nov. 19, 1988 _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ollins </PERSON>, 33, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a bus driver who left his vehicle and stopped a group of young men from beating a man on a crowded city street on Aug. 20, 1987 _ <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleroux </PERSON>, 50, <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Perron </PERSON>, 38, Repentigny, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>, 37, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hillaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, all of whom helped save a co-worker trapped beneath a crumbling wall after an explosion in an oil refinery on December 16, 1986 _ <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Asson </PERSON>, 20, <PERSON> Burley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, who broke a car window and pulled a woman free just before the car was submerged in a flooded wash in <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on Oct. 14, 1988 _ <PERSON> Donat </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletier </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernier </PERSON>, 41, both of Ste Felicite, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchet </PERSON>, 42, and <PERSON> Rejean </PERSON> <PERSON> Miville </PERSON>, 35, both of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pamphile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, who crossed the partially frozen surface of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to rescue a co-worker trapped in a bridge that was carried downstream April 1, 1986.

<HEAD>`Blackbird' Spy Plane Observes 25th Anniversary of Maiden Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees watched an SR-71 Blackbird thunder overhead Wednesday as the spy plane flew toward retirement after nearly 25 years of top-secret, supersonic service. Among the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> workers watching the flybys near the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> airport and a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> research and development facility near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> `` Kelly'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 79, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>'s legendary aircraft designer. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is in poor health, has been living at an undisclosed hospital, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The black, delta-winged reconnaissance jet, which is heading for retirement under <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> cutbacks, was first flown on Dec. 22, 1964, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaniel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Spaniel </PERSON> declined to give further details about the maiden flight, saying that much information about the intelligence-gathering aircraft remains classified. It was the first time many people had seen the black, sophisticated aircraft, even among <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> employees, said <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON>, who watched three flybys in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> from the roof of a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> building. `` It's amazing,'' <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> said. `` Some of us get used to the fact of the aircraft being around, and then you realize that a lot of people have never seen one before.'' The SR-71 was developed to succeed the U-2 spy plane, which came to symbolize the Cold War after American pilot <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> was shot down in 1960 during a reconnaissance flight high above the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Like the U-2, the Blackbird was conceived by engineers working at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION>, a highly innovative program organized by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that gained renown as the Skunk Works. Blackbirds on reconnaissance flights were frequently targeted by ground-to-air missiles and jet interceptors during the Vietnam War, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> officials said. But attempts to shoot down Blackbirds have all failed, primarily because the jet was able to outrun its attackers at speeds three times faster than the speed of sound and was able to fly at altitudes higher than 85,000 feet, officials said. While many of the SR-71's exact capabilities have remained secret, it has held several speed and altitude records for nearly a quarter century. One public record held by a Blackbird was a 15,000-mile flight completed in 10 -LCB- hours, which works out to a speed of about 1,429 mph. Background material provided by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, however, says the twin-engine jet is capable of speeds in excess of 2,000 mph. The capability of radar, infrared cameras and other intelligence-gathering sensors aboard the SR-71 also is classified. However, officials have acknowledged that the pictures produced by such equipment are sharp enough that one can read the numbers on a license plate photographed from 15 miles away.

<HEAD>WASHN: the dictator.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Q: Excuse me, General. What _ ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: Let me add one thing to what he said. The comments he made about payday should not be taken lightly. When you retire from the PDF after 26 years of service, you retire on 100 percent of your salary. Q: General, I know you said you do n't like making predictions, but how long do you think this mop-up operation will take? And what role do you see the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military playing down in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ say, over the next one to two weeks? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: I would say that the mop-up is difficult to figure. We had hoped to be able to have it done within about three days. The role we will play is assisting the Panamanians who are a sovereign state and have a President now who will begin to function, I'm certain, in maintaining order initially and recapturing control of their institutions like the police. You know, the Panamanian police are no different now than they were before. I think they have to get organized and get decent leadership, but they can go back out and maintain order. Q: Excuse me, if I can follow up. Will <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers be playing a police function down there after the mop-up? GEN. KELLY: That's conceivable. We have some MPs down there. They have police training, and we may have to assist the Panamanians for as short a period of time as possible. That's a policy decision _ that's not my decision, and then _ and we'll get guidance on it. Q: It's always been presumed, General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, that the area outside the city of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> border, has been the most friendly towards <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and it's always been speculated that if he got into trouble, he would run into that area. Have you secured that area? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: We _ we're not going to tell you everything that we've done, but the preponderance of our forces right now in the areas that I laid out for you initially where the major combat elements of the <ORGANIZATION> PDF </ORGANIZATION> are _ I think that the _ the first thing we felt we had to do was take on the PDF regular units in the vicinity of the capital, and to assist the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, the vast majority of whom live there, as you know, in reestablishing their democracy and supporting the duly elected government of the country. When that's done _ and hopefully, that wo n't take too long _ we'll then have opportunities to do other things, possibly. Q: General, is _ -LRB- inaudible -RRB- _ still going on at this point in the country? GEN. KELLY: Right now _ I just checked before we walked over here _ and not very much. As I said, in the airborne area _ and they got in late a little bit because of the bad weather _ they finished off their job this afternoon, were going in late this afternoon up to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION> to check on Battalion 2000, and found they were n't even there. So, in terms of major fighting going on right now, there is none. Q: General, what about _ Q: General, what _ General _ excuse me _ when were the _ two questions. When were the Shermans taken down to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? And the other question is, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives had contact with some of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opposition people before the Force went down. Was there any contact with PDF people thought to be sympathetic? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: To answer your first question first, when was the Shermans taken down? Some time ago. But not a long time ago. Q: A month, or _ GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: Maybe about that. And the reason I do n't give you specific data is because I do n't remember it, but it's in that ballpark. In terms of contacts with anybody, he did n't, I did n't, and nobody I know did. We had a mission to go down and that's what we did. Q: Well, I mean, the people in the embassy told the pool this morning that they had had contacts with some of the political opposition I guess Monday. GEN. KELLY: They _ they may well have, but what I was told to do was get the 82nd and the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and the others ready to go, and that's what _ that's what we did. Q: General, what about reports that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> may be either in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or he may have fled the country, and what would that do to your efforts to capture him? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: If he's gone to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, it'd obviously slow our efforts down a little bit, I guess. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- It _ Q: Can you tell me if he's in _ that he's in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: We think he is. ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: We have no reason to believe that he's outside of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. GEN. <PERSON> KELLY </PERSON>: If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, by the way, he's utterly without influence. You know, former dictators are not the same as elder statesmen. He's liable to sit on some beach until somebody stops by to say hello to him. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q: General, are the Apaches normally based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>? Q: -LRB- Inaudible -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> _ GEN. KELLY: Sir? Q: Are the the Apaches normally based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and could you describe how the other helicopters were brought down? GEN. KELLY: Well, the Apaches are not normally based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the helicopters were all brought down in larger airplanes, generally C-5s.

 Q: When did that happen? GEN. KELLY: The Apaches went down, oh, two weeks ago. Q: General _ Q: And how were the other aircraft shot down? GEN. KELLY: Which other aircraft? Q: -LRB- Inaudible. -RRB- GEN. KELLY: Groundfire. Mostly groundfire. In one case, one hit a wire. I think the other three were groundfire, were n't they _ Q: Small arms _ GEN. KELLY: Pretty much, yeah. Q: Small arms, rockets? ADM. <PERSON> SHEAFER </PERSON>: Small arms, to the best of our knowledge. Q: General, you said at the beginning that you did not find any evidence that any attack was being planned on the Canal. Had you expected to find some? GEN. KELLY: We had to be prepared for that. You know, the Canal is one of the major reasons that we're in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The treaty gives us the right to protect and defend the Canal, so that's a duty that we have. Incidentally, all of my bosses understand clearly that we're going to adhere meticulously to the provisions of that treaty, and that's part of the basis that we went down. So yeah, we were very concerned about it. And if you put the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> out of business for a couple of years, that would represent an economic difficulty in the military. Q: General _ Q: When will the reinforcements arrive? GEN. KELLY: Which reinforcements? Q: The 2,500 you're sending down of military police. GEN. KELLY: The 7th Infantry Division should be completed sometime tonight. The reason I say that is there is fog up at <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION>, and when we can get them out is a little bit difficult to predict. But right now, we've got 31 airplanes for them; 21 are in the air. The MPs left this morning, starting at eight, to the tune of one airplane per hour, so there were 25 airplanes. And I sat down and figured that out _ took a little while _ but about 25 hours will put them in there sometime. And I think we'll even beat that, so, say, 7:15 tomorrow morning _ Q: General, have you heard anything about <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> offering sanctuary to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he crosses over and lays down his arms? GEN. KELLY: I have not. Q: General, did you have difficulty getting control of the radio station that was continually broadcasting for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>? GEN. KELLY: We did n't have difficulty getting control of it because we were n't trying to get control of it. We had difficulty getting it off the air. We are still working on that, and we expect to be successful very shortly. Q: How are you doing that? Can you describe that? GEN. KELLY: I ca n't tell you how we plan to do it, but we plan to do it. Q: Could you give us a little better breakdown on the casualties? We heard earlier firefights at the Comandancia. Was it also at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> _ GEN. KELLY: Firefights went on here at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. We sent our troops in well-armed and superbly trained. And I know that sounds like bragging, but that's just the truth; they were. So they're at an advantage with almost anybody else anywhere. And the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, of course, went in at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>. They had TACAIR assisting them right before they went in. There was n't _ Q: What kind of TACAIR? GEN. KELLY: I'm not going to say, but we had TACAIR there. The Marines did n't have major enemy forces in their area. Their vital and key job was to keep the Bridge of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> open, which, of course, is the lifeline in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The fighting up here in the airborne area turned out to be stiff in places, but overall not all that difficult _ witness Battalion 2000 not putting up much of a fight. I do n't think we had too much trouble down here with the Cavalry squadron, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vieja </LOCATION>. The fighting around the Comandancia initially was probably as stiff as any that we ran into, but when we finally went into it this afternoon, it had been unoccupied; they had left. I think one of the reasons that the casualties were as low as they were was that we _ we had well-trained soldiers, we had the helicopter gunships, we had the AC-130s, which is an airforce gunship which is extremely accurate. And we took advantage of the tools that we had in order to protect our soldiers, and sailors, and airmen, and Marines. MR. WILLIAMS: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We need to get _ we need to get General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> back to the command post. Let me just make two notes here. First of all about your question about contacts with people, obviously there were contacts with the people that have now been _ now taken over as the duly elected leaders of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. They were clearly contacted before the operation and said they supported it. As Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and I think General <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said this morning, they already answered the question about contact with the PDF, and the answer is no. As to Mr. <PERSON> Engberg </PERSON>'s questions about our knowledge of people in the hotel, we're well aware of that. The Secretary is aware of it. I think General <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> referred to that early on. So we are clearly aware of the situation. Thank you all very much. Q: -LRB- Off mike -RRB- _ if there's any word? Will there be another briefing? <PERSON> MR. </PERSON> <PERSON> WILLIAMS </PERSON>: Not today.

 Police arrested 118 people including musicians <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> at a demonstration Wednesday against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s rightist government Those arrested were among 500 demonstrators outside the downtown federal building, where protesters have since mid-November gathered each Wednesday morning to block entrances. `` I'm opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the -LRB- <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government, a right-wing terror-death squad government. It has been going on for a long time,'' said <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> as he sat down in front of the building. Also sitting with <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON> was <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON>, who has been arrested at previous demonstrations at the building. <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> was part of a group that briefly got into a shoving match with police when the group briefly blocked a federal police parking lot nearby, but returned to the federal building. `` We decided not to be arrested there because we would be arrested by city police and separated from the group,'' <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> explained. The building and its perimeter are under the jurisdiction of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Protective Service police. Demonstrators are arrested for blocking access to a federal building, a $ 25 infraction. The demonstrations began after leftist rebels began a series of attacks against the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government beginning in mid-November. Those incidents have dwindled in recent weeks.

 Friends and relatives of the 270 people killed on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 gathered in this small Scottish town Wednesday, the eve of the first anniversary of the bombing, to join residents in mourning. One year ago Thursday, the New York-bound <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 exploded over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing all 259 passengers and crew members. Fiery, molten wreckage fell 31,000 feet, killing another 11 people on the ground. Dec. 21, 1988 _ the shortest day of the year _ became the longest for the suddenly bereaved, for the town of 3,500 people jolted into disaster, and for the rescuers who would give up their Christmas to search for bodies, wreckage and clues. Residents of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> hope that once Thursday's anniversary passes, they can get on with their lives and return to quiet obscurity. A group of American relatives in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> for the anniversary presented a memorial plaque to Councilman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> at the town hall Wednesday night. `` There were times when we lost our faith in fellow man,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a board member of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, a relatives' support group. `` But you only have to come here to have it restored. This town was devastated itself. These people reached out in the midst of our own devastation and guided us,'' said <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, whose brother-in-law was on the flight. Another plaque made of three slabs of gray Finnish granite inscribed with all 270 victims' named will be dedicated Thursday at a new Garden of Remembrance in Dryfesdale Cemetery outside <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. On Thursday night, about the time the world learned of the disaster last year, an ecumenical service will be held outside the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> that a year ago became a makeshift morgue. Organizers have kept both remembrance services simple, and no formal invitations have been issued. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Catto </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, will attend the plaque dedication, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said only about two dozen relatives accepted its offer to fly them to the services. The airline is not sending an official representative to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, but some employees were expected to attend in a private capacity, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The majority of families, and particularly the leadership of the families of 103, plan to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to The Victims of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, whose brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, died on the flight and who heads the group, said some relatives planned to attend a public memorial service in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday, while others would go into seclusion. `` Most people wish it would go Dec. 20th to the 22nd and forget the 21st because the 21st ... is, for I do n't know how long, for some people going to bring back just an awful, awful remembrance of that particular day,'' he said in a British television documentary, `` The Road to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>,'' shown Wednesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> said some relatives of victims decided against coming after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warned last week of possible activity by <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorists during the holiday season. Police heading the international manhunt for the Flight 103 bombers have confirmed that one focus of their investigation is the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s radical Syrian-based faction. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has denied involvement, but acknowledged his group has used devices similar to the plastic explosives concealed in a radio-cassette player that blew the jumbo jet apart. Chief Constable <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Esson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Dumfries </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Galloway </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON> says the bomb suitcase was either checked in at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where the flight originated, or passed through <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> from a feeder flight. West German authorities say there's not enough evidence to pinpoint where the bomb originated The only scar remaining in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of the English border, is a muddy vacant lot on <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON>. The main part of the plane's fuselage, with enough fuel for the trans-Atlantic journey, exploded on the crescent, destroying 26 homes. The 30-foot-deep crater has been filled in, and 10 homes are to be built on the site. A mile away in Park Place and <LOCATION> Rosebank </LOCATION>, where more than 60 bodies fell from the plane, one house has been rebuilt and 70 renovated. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Rosebank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, spoke of `` a tension in the town'' as the anniversary approached. `` There's the feeling that there was last year. It is all brought back by the media,'' he said. Several residents recently attended a course on how to deal with the media influx. `` The coverage we are getting with the anniversary looming does n't really help. It builds up pressure,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddet </PERSON>, one of them who attended the course. `` It brings back memories. Everyone in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> on the night was affected in some way. But we are fighting back. The scars are healing both in the people and the town.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Wednesday upset the 12-year-old pen pal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s deposed Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I'm really disappointed about what our two governments are doing and I feel for the safety of Panamanian and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> soldiers,'' <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WLUC </ORGANIZATION>. The schoolgirl said she was worried about the safety of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who went into hiding when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops attacked. `` I hope that he's doing OK and nothing bad will happen to him,'' she said. `` He's very nice and intelligent and seems like the kind of person someone can trust. He never let me down and I feel like I can trust him.'' <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> struck up a correspondence with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> following his 1988 indictment on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges. She has visited the dictator twice, first as his guest last year, then in October on her own. Her parents, criticized for allowing the visits, condemned the invasion. `` We are a family among the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who support the Panamanians in their struggle for self-determination and sovereignty,'' <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> said in a recorded telephone message at her home. `` We join the people and the nations of the world in calling on the president and his military to end this invasion. To the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people: Todo por la patria,'' which means `` all for the motherland,'' the recording said. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s father, prison guard <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, questioned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motives for the invasion. `` Do you think it's worth <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives to go after one man?'' he asked. `` Do you think it's worth alienating the entire hemisphere against us for political vanity?'' During <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s last visit, nine days after the October coup attempt, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> called <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> a `` meritorious daughter'' of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. She said then she feared for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he ever was brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They probably wo n't even listen to him on trial,'' she said. `` They will just put him in jail.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with economic and political pressure since his February 1988 indictment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions depressed the economy, but did not budge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Two attempts at coups failed. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> went to school as usual Wednesday, but her parents told officials to keep reporters away from the girl, said <ORGANIZATION> Negaunee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grober </PERSON>. The City Council has rejected Mrs. <PERSON> York </PERSON>'s requests that the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> mining town declare a sister city in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, who shot himself in the head last week as a corruption probe tightened around his office, died Wednesday after doctors declared him brain-dead. <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, who was not implicated personally in the investigation, had been in a coma since shooting himself once with a .38 - caliber revolver at his home Dec. His condition worsened Tuesday night as tests showed a restricted blood flow to the brain. Final tests showed little blood flow, and doctors decided Wednesday to remove him from life-support systems, said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, an associate vice chancellor at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` He essentially was found to have no brain function,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. `` It was comparable to an extensive or massive stroke.'' <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>, 57, never regained consciousness after the shooting. He had remained in critical condition and was treated with intravenous injections of a drug designed to remove fluids from the brain and reduce swelling. Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> issued a statement of condolence to <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s family, who were at the hospital when he died at 1:19 p.m. `` This is a sad and unfortunate time for his wife, Terrijean, and their children, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was appointed by <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> on Tuesday to fill <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON>'s role until the Jan. 9 convening of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which can appoint a successor. Controversy, much of it growing out of his passionate devotion to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, followed <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> during most of his 18 years in state government. He was once known as `` The Godfather'' on Capitol Hill because of his absolute, partisan control over legislation in the dual roles of chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and the House Calendar Committee. As secretary of state, he was in charge of regulating bingo and spending by lobbyists and political campaigns, all of which were involved in the federal-state investigation into public corruption. He testified in September and November 1989 before federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> investigating bingo corruption in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. He said he was told by federal agents that he was not a target of the investigation. As a result of the probe one former <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> aide, former chief bingo inspector W.D. `` Donnie'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, has gone to federal prison in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>; his longtime aide, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, has been named an unindicted co-conspirator and given immunity from prosecution. Ms. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> kept the books on a campaign fund started by <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> and two other constitutional officers on behalf of Democratic candidates for the Legislature. She admitted taking thousands of dollars from the fund, and a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> has subpoenaed records from it. The secretary of state's office had regulated charitable bingo since it was legalized for charity fund-raising in 1971. It did not become controversial, however, until 1979, when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> outlawed bingo on the final day of the session. After protracted negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the game was made legal again in 1980 and the Office of Charitable Solicitations was put in charge. Every year thereafter, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> amended the bingo law in an effort to weed out professional gambling. In October 1987, <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> revoked the bingo license for a <ORGANIZATION> Kingsport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AmVets </ORGANIZATION> post on grounds the group gave little of its profits to charity. The case was appealed up to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled bingo an unconstitutional lottery in February 1989.

 Only a few blips registered on financial markets Wednesday as investors took the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in stride. The dollar, oil and many stocks moved higher on the news of the surprise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operation, but prices later receded amid the usual concerns about interest rates and the economy. `` The initial reaction is one of a non-event,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It might have an impact if it becomes a prolonged situation.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> following several days of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer by defense forces controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average, a key barometer of financial reaction to outside events, closed down 7.68 points to the 2,687.93, following an initial rise. Stocks advancing in price narrowly outnumbered declining issues on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> confrontation's economic effects were unclear, but investors remain worried about the health of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in general. Most experts did not view the Panamanian situation as a reason for making big changes in their investment strategies. `` We've been involved in limited engagements before. This looks like a military engagement that will be over shortly,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some analysts said they looked upon the assault as generally positive because it showed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration meant business. `` I think people are encouraged by the forceful action by our government,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But there's a lot of anxieties on Wall Steet ... worries about the real estate market and a looming recession.'' In another sign that the economy was dominating investor thinking, some <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices moved slightly higher in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> signaled it might lower interest rates. The prospect of lower rates on government issues often spurs demand for existing bonds, pushing prices higher. Speculation about lower rates also helped depress the dollar in foreign exchange trading. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency initially rallied on the news of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> action because in times of international tension investors buy dollars and precious metals as safe havens for their money. The dollar closed sharply higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, but was mixed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gabriele </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar still had room to rise because of the uncertainty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` There are still a lot of question marks,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still has a lot of support in his country ... I would n't rule him out entirely.'' Gold prices were not affected significantly by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> news but managed to finish slightly higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. The oil futures market initially rallied, but prices fell back later in the day. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the leading grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was down 7 cents to settle at $ 21.21 per 42-gallon barrel. The January home heating oil contract, supported in recent days from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation, was up 0.75 cent to settle at 75.76 cents a gallon. `` I think the reaction to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> closure was totally irrational,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>, said of the early rally. Prices jumped over concern that the closing of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> might disrupt oil shipments. But as most analysts noted only a small percentage of crude shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> passes through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Panama &amp; Its Canal: A Boon to World Trade, Headache for Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, a crowning achievement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and energy, has been a boon for world trade, a symbol of achievement for Americans and a source of dismay for many Panamanians. `` The canal has been good and bad for us,'' said historian <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedreschi </PERSON> in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. `` It helped us attain independence and created an efficient class of administrators. But then the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also created and supported a Panamanian military class that, claiming it must prepare to protect the canal, has suppressed the democratic forces,'' <PERSON> Pedreschi </PERSON> said. The canal was closed for the first time in many years on Wednesday after the beginning of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack that ousted the most recent representative of that military class, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It had been closed before, but only because of landslides in the narrow Gaillaird Cut. The <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered at <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> above the southern end of the canal, hoped to have the canal open for business on Thursday, but it was n't clear if it would be safe. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> secede from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in 1903, with President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> serving as godfather, and paid the French, who started work on the canal, $ 40 million for rights and properties, then spent $ 387 million and ten years building it. Linking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and Pacific Oceans and cutting sailing time around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> by more than half, the waterway was a marvel of engineering from the start. Nearly 262 million cubic yards of dirt and rock were removed, enough to fill a train circling Earth four times. Since then, dredges have dug out nearly 400 million more cubic yards to widen it and keep the 51-mile-long waterway in running condition. An estimated 36,000 workers were employed at the peak of the enterprise, and they built dams and locks, conquered yellow fever and malaria and sawed through <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, now the peak of <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION> Cut, also known as the Gailliard Cut for its chief engineer. In order to negotiate the waterway, ships are lifted 85 feet from one ocean and deposited again in the other through the locks, whose level rises or descads depending on the ship's direction. The cuts the route from, for example, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> by 6,200 miles, and the cost is not exhorbitant: $ 1.83 per cargo ton in 1989; $ 1.46 per ton unloaded. Adventurer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliburton </PERSON>, weighing 140 pounds, paid 36 cents to swim it in the 1920s. But adventure and commerce were not the only meaning of the canal. It had quite another meaning to men like <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s mentor, the late dictator <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who made it their historic project to recover the Canal Zone. The zone was an affluent little <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, 10 miles on each side of the waterway, replete with manicured lawns, its own courts, police, stamps, stores and lifestyle. The treaty that created the Zone, a 10-mile wide domain of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sovereignty that cut <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in two, was considered unfair even by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State who arranged it, but it helped convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spend the money to build the canal. Over the years, highly paid <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> canal employees and military personnel living caused increasing resentment among poorly paid Panamanians _ especially blacks, who faced Southern-style segregation. In 1964, riots over what flags should fly at <ORGANIZATION> Balboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> left four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and 22 Panamanians dead. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Treaties, signed in 1977 by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, eliminated the Canal Zone and called for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give up all rights to the canal it built and maintained at noon on Dec. 31, 1999. When <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> died in a plane accident in 1981, an obscure military intelligence officer whom he had befriended began to work himself up the ladder of power. In 1983, he became head of the Defense Forces. The treaty, the Canal and compliance became one of many bones of contention between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s stint as leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>

 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- AM -RRB- _ The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is supporting democracy by not interfering in other countries while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, this time, is supporting democracy by sending troops into another country, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> noted Wednesday. In discussing the Soviet criticism of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on the forces of dictator Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` Let me say that I think both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today are supporting democracy.

 A Marine killed in Wednesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had been eager `` to get on with the job they were there to do,'' and relatives of a slain soldier who remained in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> despite their pleas say they are angry. `` My own opinion, I think it was stupid,'' said <PERSON> Andriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, sister of Cpl. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who died during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strike in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` My father is very, very angry. We do n't know how we feel right now.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, had been in the Army for four years, and his sister <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON> said he could n't have been happier. He loved it so much, she said, that when he lost his sight in one eye last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> offered him an honorable discharge. `` He wanted to keep going,'' she said. `` We told him to get out, he had a chance. He just really enjoyed being there. Ever since he was a little kid, he wanted to be a soldier.'' Paratroopers' wives, meanwhile, were told their husbands would n't be home by Christmas. `` There was no way to tell when they'd be back,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, one of the military wives who attended a briefing at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 82nd Airborne paratroops. A serviceman airlifted out of that Central American country worried about the family he left behind, and military retirees cheered the invasion. `` If they want help, I'll join them,'' retired Marine <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>' Camp Lejeune. Marine Cpl. <PERSON> Garreth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaak </PERSON>, one of 15 servicemen killed in the operation, had left on a three-month tour of duty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in late October, his father, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaak </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isaak </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native based at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>, had been scheduled to return home in January, and would have turned 23 on Dec. 28. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaak </PERSON> said he spoke to his son about a week ago by telephone. Two days ago, the family received a letter dated Dec. 10. `` He said he was anxious to get on with the job they were there to do,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, a friend who read the letter. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Isaak </PERSON> was referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, military police ordered reporters out of the area, and the base was closed to the news media until further notice. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said officials confirmed her husband, Sgt. <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, was involved in the operation, which was no surprise to her. She said officials gave the wives something of a pep talk. `` They told us it's like they were training for a big football game and this is the football game,'' she said. `` I know that sounds crazy, but it's true.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said it was comforting to hear any news. `` We were worried, wanting to know something,'' she said. `` This put me at ease as much as they could.'' At the USO servicemen's lounge at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> representative announced that military charter flights scheduled for early Wednesday, Thursday and Friday had been canceled, said lounge director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` We've got a huge amount of people -LRB- in the lounge -RRB- trying to get out,'' many waiting for a flight to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Among those at the lounge was <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spec </ORGANIZATION>. 4 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said he was worried because he had n't heard from his wife, <PERSON> Mirna </PERSON>, who's been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since Saturday. He said he, his wife and two stepsons had been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on leave when he went to an Army post to look for a place to stay. The Army ordered him to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and hustled him onto a plane before he could tell his family. His Panamanian wife and children were staying with his wife's relatives in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but he has n't heard from them since being flown out `` She needs to check in at a military base, where she needs to check with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said, almost in tears. `` I've checked with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> here myself, and they said it might difficult to get in touch with her. He said he planned to stay in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> until he hears something about his family.

 Some Americans called it necessary, a professor in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said it was an overreaction and a Panamanian dissident in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in his homeland Wednesday was a `` profound error.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 200 people marched through midtown to protest the invasion, chanting `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>!'' and other slogans. They were jeered by numerous passersby. `` Get out of here!'' banker <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> shouted at the protesters. `` You're wrong!'' About 200 protesters marched in downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and about 100 gathered in freezing temperatures in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a sister <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> country that has outrageous conditions of poverty. Military solutions bring nothing,'' <PERSON> Dessima </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> and a fellowship student at <ORGANIZATION> Radcliffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> rally. `` You need a revolution here in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' she said to cheers from the crowd. `` You need a revolution in foreign policy. While Americans and others had mixed opinions about President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, they expressed little support for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` If I had a Christmas wish it'd be that dictators like that all die,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, a 26-year-old sales assistant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` What we're doing here is getting rid of a hooligan that is causing great turmoil in our hemisphere,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, national president of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 125,00 members nationwide. `` I think it's a good move. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is an international criminal and should be brought to justice,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 62, civil court manager in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` I do n't always agree with an eye for an eye, but how much can you take?'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Epps </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Randallstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, referring to the death of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` It's not a war on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It's a war on drugs,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON>, a street vendor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said in reference to drug charges against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The drugs are undermining our country.'' Criticism centered on the invasion early Wednesday by American troops in search of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` This was a profound error. As a Panamanian and an professor of international law, I ca n't agree with the action the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has taken,'' said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON>, a Fulbright professor at <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and editor of the Panamanian opposition newspaper, <LOCATION> Alternativa </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervenes with thousands of people just to arrest one guy. This is n't going to help in the long term of our relationship,'' he said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, an assistant professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and Latin American specialist, said he thought the attack was an overreaction. `` It is particularly unfortunate of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to rely on force to resolve issues at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has renounced the use of force against countries on its borders,'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Latin America studies program, said <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should solve its own problems. `` We, just like the Soviets, have to learn to be more relaxed in dealing with the countries that are essentially under our wing,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in a statement. The executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> condemned the military action. `` Shorn of rhetoric, this is another case of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imposing its will on another country through direct military intervention, a clear violation of international law,'' said <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, who helped organize the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> protest, said the invasion violated the Constitution. `` Only <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can declare war,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said. Another protester, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayling </PERSON>, said the invasion was an attempt to regain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to turn the canal over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the year 2000. Condemnation also came from the family of <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, a 12-year-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> girl who struck up a correspondence with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> following his 1988 indictment on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug charges and twice has visited the dictator. The telephone at the family's home in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Negaunee </LOCATION> was answered by a recorded message from <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>: `` We join the people and the nations of the world in calling on the president and his military to end this invasion. To the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people: Todo por la patria,'' which means `` all for the motherland.'' Others expressed reservations. `` Personally, I do n't think it's a great idea. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> is n't that happy about it and things were going good with them prior to this,'' said <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumann </PERSON>, 23, a sales assistant from <LOCATION> Henrietta </LOCATION>, N.Y. But support came from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s predecessor and former public officials. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to protect the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and to restore democracy there was correct and deserves our full support,'' former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement issued from his office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He said the administration has tried to reach a negotiated settlement to the problems in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> rejected all diplomatic efforts. `` There comes a time when a president must take action. That time has come. I join all Americans in the hope that the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will soon know the freedoms to which they are entitled, and that those who have so abused their power there will be brought to justice,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader when the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty was ratified in 1977, said the assault was the `` only logical response to the situation.'' <PERSON> Ambler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who negotiated the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, said public criticism from democratically elected <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> leaders is likely. `` What Latin American leaders will say publicly and what they think privately are two different things. But they frankly are very happy to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> fall,'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` We should have done it a long time ago,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, retiree who served in World War II and the Korean War. `` I'm sorry I'm too old to go ... I do n't feel lives are lost when it's for a good cause.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> scholar and author of a series of books on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said the intervention could be a big plus for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s popularity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ` As long as the government is acting on behalf of democratic institutions, getting rid of a pretty terrible dictator, putting in power people who were elected, and not putting claims on the country or the canal, I do n't think there will be serious criticism,'' he said from <LOCATION> Hoover </LOCATION>, a think tank on the <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> campus.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack force captured or drove most regular Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> from their bases on Wednesday and planned to begin clearing the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday of troops loyal to their fugitive leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` It looks like the organized resistance is a thing of the past,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, the director of operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Joint Staff. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops reported seeing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> several times on Tuesday, but on Wednesday he and an undetermined number of loyal troops eluded capture, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. Fifteen American servicemen were killed, more than 100 were wounded and one was missing, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said. An American female dependent also died in the fighting. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces captured 250 members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s army. Sporadic fighting was reported late in the day, but most Panamanian units had dispersed and may have fled into the jungle, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` We have a concern that they have gone off into the jungle,'' he told reporters. `` There is every chance that we will go off after them.'' The main operation on Thursday will be moving military police and other units into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a city of 1 million where nine of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s 18 so-called Dignity Battalions were spotted Wednesday, said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaefer </PERSON>, an intelligence specialist. The Dignity Battalions, which beat civilian candidates during elections last spring, are poorly armed and organized and are not considered a major military threat, said <PERSON> Shaefer </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials expect ship traffic to resume Thursday through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` The canal is functioning. There has been no endeavor that we have discovered to destroy it,'' he said. The more than 20,000 American troops sent against Panamanian military bases Wednesday moved in relative secrecy and carried out simultaneous, pre-dawn attacks using paratroopers, infantry and light tank units, top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say. `` It is among the most professionally executed operations that I have seen in 33 years of military status,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing. But he said without elaborating that `` we have information that human beings in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have made mistakes.'' The identities of the dead and wounded had not been released by late afternoon; casualties were being flown to <ORGANIZATION> Kelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces failed initially to capture their prime target, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Hours after the 1 a.m. invasion, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops continued to encounter sniper fire and pockets of resistance, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. Nevertheless, Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, proclaimed `` Operation Just Cause'' a success. `` This reign of terror is over,'' he proclaimed. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, in a breakfast-hour briefing, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` not running anything, because we own all of the bases he owned eight hours ago.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, involving Ranger paratroopers, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> infantrymen and light tanks, were launched simultaneously against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military bases and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s heaquarters, the Commandencia. `` I hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was, and how competently it was carried out,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. In addition to the 13,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent 7,000 troops there overnight and was airlifting an additional 2,500 over the course of the day, for a total of 22,500, said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> before the invasion included the 193rd Infantry Brigade, reinforced with <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> units; a battalion from the 7th Infantry division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; a mechanized battalion from the 5th Infantry Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> units, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The decision to invade was made Sunday night. The next night, the of additional forces from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began, including a brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, two Ranger battalions, and selected Special Operations units. Units headed for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Tuesday included the 16th Military Police brigade from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the units were concentrated into four main groups. They are: _ <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the 82nd Airborne and 7th Infantry divisions, which occupied the <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Gamboa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, where they liberated 47 Panamanian officers taken prisoner after the abortive Oct. 3 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ Task Force <PERSON> Semper </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidelis </PERSON>, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> and a light armored infantry company, which attacked the area around the Bridge of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, and `` completed their missions successfully,'' he said _ <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION>, which attacked two Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> units that had been loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in the Oct. 3 coup, the 6th and 7th Infantry Companies Some <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists were captured but others escapted, he said. _ Task Force Bayonet, made up of the 6th Mechanized battalion, light tanks, and the 5th battalion of the 87th Infantry, which attacked <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters, the scene of the heaviest fighting Asked whether <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might form a guerrilla army, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said: `` He can do that, and we will chase him and we will find him. He is a very canny individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to survive catastrophe, and we'll see over time whether he survives this catastrophe. `` It's been some years since General _ <LOCATION> Mister </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the fugitive, has been seen in the jungle. He's used to a different kind of lifestyle. I'm not quite sure he would be up to being chased around the countryside by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and light infantry units.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> condemned the use of force by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in speeches Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> but bogged down in haggling over procedures to vote on a resolution. Many of the members spoke out against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but they held fast to a rule requiring resolutions be submitted 24 hours before a vote can take place. They agreed to meet again Thursday. The resolution was suggested by <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, a supporter of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>, and was introduced by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> called on the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to condemn the `` brutal and criminal aggression'' against his country by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked members to `` rally around'' the decision to send <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We hope you will understand and support our action,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>. In a separate action, the Mexican government condemned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion, although it also denounced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` The fight against international crime is not sufficient reason to intervene in a sovereign nation,'' the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government said in a statement issued through its embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s opinion, dialogue and negotiation continue to offer the best alternative in finding a peaceful solution to the situation.'' Among the usual allies condemning the use of force at the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting were <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Before the meeting began, the members met behind closed doors to discuss a letter sent by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s newly sworn-in president, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, asking that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> recognize <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chewning </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON> as his designated representative. The letter was telefaxed from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> members decided to recognize <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>. They did not consider the issue of whether they recognized <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and his government. `` The forces of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continue bombing,'' <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ministers at an emergency session called by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to denounce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion in his country. `` Under no circumstances will we accept some supposed leaders who are puppets imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s government, which is recognized by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The resolution before the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> asked members to condemn the use of force and demand a withdrawal of the troops. One of the ambassadors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said shortly before the meeting began that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> `` has to condemn this act, no matter how bad <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is. We ca n't condone violence.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday that he ordered troops into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to save American lives and bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be tried on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would withdraw its invasion force as soon as possible. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is very pleased that the outlaw regime manipulated by <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has given way to a regime that reflects the democratic will of the people,'' <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> members. `` Noriega increasingly acted in an unstable, unpredictable and dangerous manner.'' The Nicaraguan representative, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, sided with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` It is an aberration to speak of democracy and carry out aggression,'' she said.

 Two transport planes flew 108 servicemen wounded in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to military hospitals Wednesday, but three were dead on arrival and another died later, officials said. The first C-141 landed at <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> at 11:37 a.m. with 43 soldiers aboard, including the three dead and the one who died shortly after arrival.

Some were well enough to take buses, and others were taken by ambulance, said <LOCATION> Lackland </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. The second C-141 arrived at Kelly around 5:30 p.m. with 65 soldiers with `` serious to very critical'' injuries, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Lackland </LOCATION> spokesman. `` The biggest and the most extensive injuries are gunshot-type wounds, schrapnel-type wounds, leg wounds, broken bones, this sort of thing,'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. Forty-one of the soldiers on the second flight were taken across town to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said. The rest went to <LOCATION> Wilford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. Another transport was expected later Wednesday, said <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who was unsure how many wounded would be aboard. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> officials were told their base would be the sole reception point for wounded from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said 15 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen and a female civilian dependent were killed, one serviceman was missing and more than 100 were wounded.

 Requests for help from the homeless and hungry increased during the past year _ particularly among families with children _ and many cities were unable to meet the need, according to a survey released today. Many cities were forced to turn away families and others needing shelter and food, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Conference of Mayors said. Increases in hunger, homelessness and poverty are `` one of the most dramatic changes that swept across our country'' in the 1980s, said <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, chairman of the conference's task force on hunger and homelessness. Requests for emergency shelter in 1989 increased by 25 percent in the cities surveyed, said the mayors' annual report on hunger and homelessness in urban America.

 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> is supporting a plan under which the government early next year would mail monthly refunds to millions of elderly people overcharged for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premiums. If the plan goes through, Social Security beneficiaries who unavoidably will be overcharged by about $ 5.30 a month for their Medicare coverage early in 1990 will be simultaneously issued monthly refund checks. The overcharges are the result of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' late action in repealing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>'s catastrophic health-care program. Social Security contends its computers ca n't be adjusted by January to halt withholding of the extra Medicare premium for catastrophic coverage. As a result, nearly 27 million Social Security beneficiaries who have <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks are expected to be overcharged from January through May.

<HEAD>Quayle Making the Most of Favorable Publicity</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year into his vice presidency, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is making the most of any favorable publicity that comes his way, his wry smile an acknowledgement that it has been scarce. There is no comparable shortage of advice _ he gets that all the time. He's been told to raise his profile, and to lower it; to be more relaxed, and to be more guarded against gaffes. He has been advised to specialize on a few, chosen trademark issues, and to be a generalist so as to display a grasp on the whole catalogue of issues. Through it all, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has one set answer: he works for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and he will keep doing what the boss wants done. His assignment in 1990 will include a heavy political campaign schedule, a traditional vice presidential role in off-year elections. For <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that job could be a way to overcome old image problems and prove that he's not out of his depth, perceptions that haunt him in the public opinion surveys. Vice presidents tend to be underemployed; as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said in shunning the post he later filled, they are standby equipment. They usually get specialized assignments _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s include space issues and efforts to enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness in world markets. But other officials have primary, day-to-day responsibility. It's always difficult for the No. 2 man to put his own imprint on government actions or decisions. As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed a task force on regulatory reform, a popular topic in the deregulation decade. It looked like a promising role, but not much happened. That's not uncommon for understudies. A vice president is a dependent. His official standing depends entirely on the boss. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has helped on that score. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sees <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> every morning when both are in town, and says he has full access to the president. `` This has been a very comfortable, important relationship that we have worked out in these early morning sessions,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said this week in a C-Span television interview. That well-advertised access provides a sort of power. `` When I'm on Capitol Hill ... senators, congressmen say ` would you please give this to the president?' or ` tell the president this,' or ` I do n't like this particular policy, I want you to do something about it,''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in the TV interview. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has publicly promised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> renomination for a second term as vice president and top Republicans consider the commitment to be absolute. But neither job security nor presidential praise has done much for the performance ratings, despite what <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> considers a good first year in office. So he relished a Dec. 15 Wall Street Journal column praising his performance. `` After 12 months in this job I will take any favorable publicity I can possibly obtain, and I will pocket it,'' he said. `` And I think I'll take that editorial and make sure that it's reprinted and perhaps sent out to some of my friends. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders say that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can raise both his profile and his standing in 1990 in the off-year campaign role that has become traditional for vice presidents. He already gets good ratings for his work for party candidates and causes. The party counts about $ 7 million in proceeds from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fundraising events featuring <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be out campaigning for chosen <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates next year, as he has at fundraising events for two GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> challengers. But the heavy schedule of sustained campaigning is assigned to the vice president. It was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the two off-year elections of his vice presidency, and it will be <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s in 1990 He'll have help. In January, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Republican chairman, will become his deputy chief of staff, concentrating on political liaison and supervising speech writing, travel planning and the like. The vice president says he'd like to spend more time outside the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> beltway, in `` the real <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He'll have ample opportunity in the coming campaign, in a role that can help him shape a new image or cement the old one. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said his sometimes shaky performance in the 1988 campaign was due in part to traveling consultants who over-coached him to the point of stifling him. In 1990 he can do it his way.

 When producer <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> created <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Home'' show two years ago to help people live their lives he did n't know it was going to get so personal `` What the show is really about is to give people ideas and help them make decisions,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. The morning show offers practical suggestions on health, cooking, home buying and remodeling, automobiles and arts. It has a number of regular experts, including one who reviews movies and videos from the standpoint of families with small children. `` Home'' marks its 500th show on Thursday and celebrates its second anniversary on Jan. 18. But for <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, who established <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' `` The <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' `` That's Incredible'' and many other shows, it got very personal seven months ago. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, 55, suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass surgery. Since then, he's lost 47 pounds by changing his eating habits and exercising. `` I cut out fats and dairy products from my diet and took up exercise,'' he said. `` I went from being a sedentary individual to a person who's active again. I get more sleep. I do yoga. I found that doctors do n't know anything about diet. I read all the books that people sent me when I had my heart attack. I picked out the things that worked for me.'' He put his personal experiences on the air and made a rare appearance as a guest. Last July, after he returned to work, he devoted a week to a series called `` Heart and Soul.'' The show was devoted to a study that showed yoga, meditation and positive affirmation are helpful in preventing and recovering from heart attacks. `` Home'' also undergoes a change next Tuesday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> takes over as host, replacing <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> has been host of the Miss America Pageant for the past five years and was the Emmy-winning host of `` Hour Magazine.'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said he's wanted to do `` Home'' ever since he founded `` Good Morning America'' in 1975. `` I wanted a show that would go later in the morning,'' he said. `` Its purpose is to give women information that they can apply to their lives. The key word here is information. I said to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, ` Give me 60 minutes and I'll give you 30 ideas you've never heard of.' It's a hard show to promote because we offer help for the home. `` Recently in the TV listings ` <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON>' had a show about women who had shot their husbands and still loved them. ` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>' had satanic babies. ` <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>' had cross-dressing. And we had a show about barbecuing. `` We do n't have a great come on. But the people who watch our show come back. That's why <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> is taking over. I want to add his marquee value to the show. I think he'll bring us viewers.'' Of all network shows on daytime television, `` Home'' has the largest audience among women 18-34, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said. `` Home'' also puts out a newsletter that goes to two million subscribers. A show on poisons in the home got 44,000 responses to a 900 number. For $ 2 viewers got a newsletter, information on poisons and $ 6 in coupons. The sponsor had expected only about 5,000 responses. Since it began, the show has expanded to an hour from 30 minutes and has gone to live telecast instead of tape. The live telecast allows the show to have satellite remotes and to take instant polls. `` Home'' has also taken its name to heart and has purchased three houses and is about to purchase a fourth. `` We take the viewer through every step of the purchase and financing,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. `` Then we go in and remodel and redecorate the house. We started with a house that cost about $ 160,000. Then we sold it and bought a house for $ 240,000. Each time we apply the profit to buying a more expensive house. The last house we bought for $ 300,000 but we have n't been able to sell it because of the poor real estate market. `` The last house is a duplex. People had asked us to do something on apartments. Each side of the house is like an apartment, so we were able to show people things to do with smaller space.''

 Others have dared, but there's really only one <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>, and her name is <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. Along with her role as nurse <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbush </PERSON> in `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> is the 76-year-old entertainer's favorite part. It's in his self-description that she'd like to be remembered: `` I'm youth. I'm joy. I'm freedom.'' Right now, though, she's happy to be recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts in its annual `` The Kennedy Center Honors.'' A taped show of the early December festivities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will be broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 29. Other honorees are actress <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, entertainer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON>, composer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuman </PERSON> and ballerina <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Danilova </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> found out she was to be honored from her old friend, Miss <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>. `` I was on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard last summer and she called from <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and said, ` Did you hear we're going to be together?''' Although Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> counts her three years of making movies as the low part of her life, she did make some close friends in the business, including Miss <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>. `` She came to stay with me in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> when I was doing ` South Pacific' over there. She had just lost her husband,'' Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> recalled in an interview in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment of her son, actor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>. `` In the Paramount -LRB- studio -RRB- days, they made me up to look like her. In those days whoever was very famous, they made you look like her. One night we were at a party at <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>'s house. I was sitting with <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON>'s husband, a very famous doctor. We were talking at great length. He said he must go see a man. He came back and said, ` I think we have to go home now.' `` I said: ` I'd like to go home with you, but you ca n't go home with me. I'm not <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON>.' `` They made me look so much like her, he thought it was. I have pictures. You ca n't tell us apart.'' Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> after her star-making debut on Broadway in 1938, singing `` My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' in `` Leave It to Me.'' `` I did n't like making movies at all,'' she said. She and the president of Paramount `` out-Southerned each other,'' talking tough in honeyed accents over her declared intention of leaving _ she saying she'd go back to <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and reopen her dance studio, he saying she could n't break her contract. The compromise was a leave of absence to star on Broadway in `` One Touch of Venus'' in 1943. She went on to portray <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> in `` The Sound of Music'' and to star in `` Peter Pan'' and `` South Pacific.'' Her last show, `` Legends!,'' in which she toured with <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> in 1986, did n't make it to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` It's one show I did n't like,'' she said. `` I did the show because <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> said to me, ` Mother, you've been off long enough.' Now I think my children are going to decide to let me do what I want to. I think it's very sweet of them. I have many ideas. I might do something after New Year's. I'm superstitious; I wo n't say what.'' Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> last flew in <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON>'s aerial rig when she was 70, at a benefit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` I could do it this minute,'' she said. Learning to fly came naturally _ and very young. `` I put my arms up and took off from our garage. I heard mother screaming from the kitchen, ` What have you done now?' She saw me take off. I knew I could fly. There was a little problem there. I hit the ground first. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> had n't come along. I broke my collarbone.'' Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was 13 years younger than her sister. Her mother had wanted a boy but got a tomboy who broke many bones. And young <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> married at 16 to get away from school, had a son at 17 and went into show business, her mother was more than happy to raise her grandson. `` She worshiped him; I could n't take him away from her,'' Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, 13-year star of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' grew up saying he wanted nothing to do with sow business, because it took his mother away from him. `` He felt neglected,'' she admits. But he overcame negative feelings about both show business and his mother. Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was divorced from <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hageman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Weatherford </LOCATION> lawyer, shortly after their son was born -LRB- <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> later dropped the ` e' in his last name -RRB-. In 1940, she married agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliday </PERSON>. They had a daughter, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> was fabulous. We had a wonderful marriage.'' He died in 1973, a few years after they retired to a ranch in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> was getting married, so Miss <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> spent a year in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, then sold the ranch and bought homes on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard and in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert. She has six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. All attended the Kennedy Center ceremony.

 Federal engineers have upgraded an investigation of a possible steering deficiency in the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION>, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also said Tuesday it was investigating reports of exploding heating systems in <ORGANIZATION> Coachmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> recreational vehicles and of cruise control failures in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Taurus and its twin, the Mercury Sable. The agency said it was stepping up its Beretta probe from a preliminary evaluation, which involves mostly paperwork, to an engineering analysis, in which the possibly defective parts are examined. Such investigations can lead to recalls or can be dismissed if engineers decide there is no widespread safety problem. There have been 39 complaints of loss of steering control in the 1988 Beretta, agency spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. Twenty-one accidents and 10 injuries have been blamed on the problem. An estimated 259,000 of the vehicles are on the road. The Chevrolet <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION> is similar to the Beretta, but the agency did not mention any steering problems with the <LOCATION> Corsica </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyden </PERSON> said the company would continue cooperating with the agency in its investigation. `` An engineering analysis does n't necessarily mean there's a defect with the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Pyden </PERSON> said. The agency has begun a preliminary evaluation of <ORGANIZATION> Coachmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> recreational vehicles manufactured between 1981 and 1985. There have been four reports of explosions in the vehicles' furnaces, which burn liquified petroleum gas, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said No injuries or accidents have been reported. An estimated 40,000 of the vehicles were manufactured in the five-year period, he said. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Coachmen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said she was not familiar with the report and could not comment. The agency also launched a preliminary evaluation of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable manufactured between 1986 and 1988. There have been 15 reports of cruise controls failing to disengage, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. No accidents or injuries have been reported. The investigation covers an estimated 1.25 million vehicles, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said.

 Importers of Grand Marnier liqueur say the failure of about 10 percent of the 200,000 motorized holiday advertisements they placed in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine earlier this month does n't discourage them. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Carillon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, called the failure rate `` normal when introducing new technology'' and said he remained committed to trying new approaches to magazine ads. He estimated there have been about 500 complaints from readers who were disappointed that the highly-touted ad did n't work as they thought it should. The ad shows two birds with opposite ends of a ribbon in their beaks. The ribbon is draped around a liqueur bottle and as the birds alternately appear to fly higher, the bottle beneath them swings as if it were a bell. <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview that reader surveys indicated 10 percent of the ads failed to operate as intended, and that the company was distributing replacements to those who ask for them. `` It's not a serious problem. We have mailed out 500 or so ads to people who said their ad did n't work,'' he said. He said the technology which made use of a battery and wire embedded beneath the pieces of cardboard used for the ad was sensitive and some systems were likely to get crushed in the binding and mailing processes. Some of the ads sent back were in working condition, but the readers apparently did n't wait long enough for the motorized action to begin, <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> said. He said a few people complained that the bell did n't ring _ but the ad was not designed to emit any sound. And other ads simply did n't work. From <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>'s perspective, getting a complaint is n't the worst thing that could happen. `` It shows they were interested by the ad,'' he said. <PERSON> Carillon </PERSON> spent about $ 750,000 on producing and placing the ad in 200,000 issues of the Dec. 11 edition of The New Yorker that were sent to subscribers in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. The company has tried to make use of advances in technology for other magazine ads in the past, including singing and talking microchips for another of its products, Absolut vodka. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>, said the magazine got `` about a dozen calls'' about Grand Marnier ads that failed to move. But he said he welcomed the attention that <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>'s ads bring to the magazine. `` We hope he does something as innovative next year,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said.

 The soft <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> real estate market has made <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> jumpy in recent days, but analysts say the slowdown has been coming for a long time and is n't likely to disappear soon. The nervousness began Friday, when <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced it expected to report a `` substantial'' loss for the year because it had to boost reserves to cover bad real estate loans. The bank, the nation's 15th largest, also said it might rescind a stock dividend and would consider possible mergers and sales of assets. The weekend seemed only to increase worries, and on Monday the stock market took its sharpest drop in five weeks, with the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average falling 42.02 points to 2697.53. Although the market stabilized Tuesday, brokers said investors remained uneasy about the outlook for real estate, finance and regional banks. `` It's probably too early to say ` recession,''' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a banking industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But some of the banks are going to be disasters. The fears in the market are n't groundless. The question on many minds was whether a regional real estate slump could precipitate a full-scale nationwide recession, so far averted after seven years of economic growth. `` Economic factors feed on each other, and it's hard to say whether this leads to other declines,'' said <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakutani </PERSON>, a director of bank analysts for <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a credit-rating agency. `` But along with real estate we're seeing slowdowns in manufacturing and the service industries.'' One real estate group said Tuesday that talk of regional real estate problems having national economic implications was overblown. `` Many of these ` doom and gloom' analyses are authored on the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>, where median home prices in some cities have declined over the past year,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` At any given time, some housing markets are hot, some are not.'' Analysts said the real estate problem began when zealous regional banks courted too many deals during the construction boom of the mid-1980s. `` There was too much money chasing too few good deals,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantini </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate service company. `` There was a lot of money in the hands of some inexperienced lending officers. People who had made only $ 100,000 loans were suddenly making $ 5 million loans.'' The big money fueled competition, and a herd mentality. `` Everyone got bullish on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fantini </PERSON> said. `` It was viewed as a wonderful market. Few people thought it would end.'' The building continued, but buying stopped. The state's high-tech industry, the juggernaut behind much of the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle,'' sputtered Today, office buildings that computer firms thought they could fill lie empty along Route 128 west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kakutani </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s said real estate's dire straits could be traced back at least 18 to 20 months, but banks are just starting to take it seriously, he said. `` There's no question the banks were slow to respond,'' <PERSON> Kakutani </PERSON> said. `` But banks often reflect the perceptions of the market. Three months ago, most banks would have said this was part of a periodic boom-and-bust cycle. They're not saying that anymore.'' The only immediate solution for banks, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said, is to keep bad loans to a minimum, and to cut costs _ layoffs, in other words. <PERSON> Fantini </PERSON> admitted the situation was bad, but said federal regulators were making it worse by forcing lending institutions to liquidate their real estate assets too quickly. `` Regulators say to banks, ` Sell your real estate assets.' I say, ` To who?''' <PERSON> Fantini </PERSON> said. `` There's no capital out there for liquidation.'' To dig themselves out of their financial quagmire, <PERSON> Fantini </PERSON> suggested banks offer incentives like low-interest mortgages to first-time home buyers. The only bright spot in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s real estate market may be cheaper homes for some buyers. Optimists hope declining interest rates will support the real estate market via lower mortgage rates for buyers and refinancings at lower costs for some existing homeowners. `` This will provide opportunities to buy condominiums or houses,'' <PERSON> Kakutani </PERSON> said. `` It will make home buying a more viable option for some.'' And the future? In all likelihood housing demand will continue dropping, if population figures are any indication. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiw </PERSON>, who has studied population trends, said in the next decade there wo n't be many home buyers to replace the baby-boomers, who drove housing prices up in the 1970s and early'80s. `` We're coming into an unprecedented time in terms of low population growth,'' <PERSON> Mankiw </PERSON> said. `` The 1990s will be a slow time for housing.''

 Three Argentinian nationals have been found guilty of trying to extort $ 10 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for the return of stolen documents the company claimed contained trade secrets for the production of <LOCATION> Lycra </LOCATION>. Lycra is <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s trade name for spandex, an elastic fiber used primarily in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards. A federal jury deliberated about two hours Tuesday before returning guilty verdicts for conspiracy and attempted extortion against <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Inigo </PERSON>. They each face up to 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Longobardi </PERSON> set sentencing for Feb. 26. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrosino </PERSON>, another defendant, is fighting extradition from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Charges were dropped against <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianchini </PERSON>, who agreed to testify for the federal government. During the nine-day trial, the prosecution portrayed <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> as the mastermind behind the extortion attempt. The defense, however, claimed <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> had not attempted extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture spandex for Radicci, an Italian textile manufacturer. The defense argued that <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> initiated the contact with <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> after Mexican textile manufacturer <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Assa </PERSON> told the Wilmington-based chemical giant that <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> had the documents. <PERSON> Assa </PERSON> was a former employer of <LOCATION> Skerianz </LOCATION>. The prosecution argued <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> had been induced against its will to agree to pay $ 10 million for 1,581 documents concerning Lycra production that were stolen from its Lycra manufacturing plant in Mercedes, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. The prosecution said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> was forced to enter into an agreement with <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> and the others. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON> and the others would not work in spandex production for five years. In addition, during that period, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> would agree to sell 20 tons of spandex yarn per month to a company chosen by <PERSON> Skerianz </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Mexican-U.S. Business Groups Proposing Common Market for North America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Creation of a North American common market, consisting of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, is an idea which appeals to a large majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents, according to a new poll. The poll, released this week, was taken for a group of leading Mexican business executives and an affiliated group in this country. The groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businessmen </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, say such a common market is needed to compete successfully with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. `` Of the 1,200 individuals polled throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 85 percent favored a North American common market to offset anticipated heavy competition when the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries drop their trade frontiers in 1992,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USDC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cueto </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Businessmen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- MCB -RRB-, also said 1992 would be a critical year for international trade. His organization, which includes owners, chairmen and executive officers of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s top 36 industrial groups, has long stressed U.S.-Mexican cooperation. <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> USDC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said no formal proposals for the creation of such a common market had been submitted to government officials in the three nations involved. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, however, said there had been some preliminary talks with several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen. `` It's an evolutionary thing that appears to be inevitable,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said of the elimination of North American trade barriers. `` It's a matter of common sense. `` You have: <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with vast natural resources and a large pool of less expensive labor; the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, with technological expertise and a highly developed economy; and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, with a small population, but a strong currency and credit power.'' `` Trade barriers have essentially been erased between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. `` And we have proof that the same thing would work between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> through the ` Maquiladora' program, whereby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers have goods finished in communities across the Mexican border and reimported into this country.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said some people worry about cheap Mexican labor taking jobs away from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers, but that that would n't be the case if cooperation created jobs in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` Consider,'' he said, `` the resources in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the potential Mexican market for luxury goods the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market is already saturated with. `` People think of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> as being like the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Most do n't realize that if that wall came down, the heavy traffic _ businesswise _ would be southbound.'' The telephone poll taken during November for the <ORGANIZATION> MCB </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USDC </ORGANIZATION> employed a sample similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national averages by gender, age, ethnic background, educationl level and political philosophy, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. Not surprisingly, the poll found that people of Hispanic background, whether it be Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or from another Spanish-speaking region, took a greater interest in Mexican affairs than the general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. While only one third of the total respondents considered <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a good place for American investment, more than 55 percent of the Hispanic respondents considered it so. At the same time, though, 90 percent of the total respondents said it was important for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to move ahead economically. The poll, however, also revealed that many non-Hispanic Americans have little knowledge of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s political institutions and recent history. `` Only about a third correctly identified <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as a democratic country,'' said <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cueto </PERSON>. `` A greater number _ almost 40 percent, in fact _ believe it to be socialistic, while more than 7 percent even termed it a communist nation.''

 American businesses operating in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> scrambled today to assess the impact of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military invasion, closing some offices and checking whether the fighting endangered their employees. The government estimates 35,000 Americans live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, many of whom work for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said only that all the company's employees are safe. `` That's all we're prepared to say ... it's just too preliminary to make any other comment,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> owns a large refinery in the Colon area, near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 In trying to evaluate a mutual fund as a prospective investment for the 1990s, anyone might naturally start by asking, `` how has it done in the'80s?'' Steeped as they may be in the old doctrine that past performance is no guarantee of future results, experienced investors nevertheless want to see what a fund's managers have demonstrated they can accomplish. Ten-year periods, furthermore, provide a convenient reference point for people who are pursuing long-term financial goals. Any fund that can turn in good results over such a protracted span presumably has something going for it beyond luck or a fleeting hot streak. Conversely, experts on the subject say, a fund that could n't flourish in the lush financial climate of the 1980s ought to have some explaining to do before you entrust your money to it for the years ahead But with all that, some advisers say, you can go astray by putting too much reliance on long-term past performance in the process of picking a fund. For one thing, notes <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, publisher of the advisory letter The No-Load Fund Investor in <LOCATION> Hastings-on-Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, if you insist on a 10-year record these days you are going to eliminate a great many possibilities right off the bat. Among the 241 diversified stock funds he follows, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> says, more than half did n't start operating until 1980 or later, and nearly a third have gone into the business since 1985. `` That's a lot of potentially outstanding funds to ignore,'' he observes. In the mutual fund game, many analysts say, young up-and-comers often enjoy a special edge on their older competition. While they are still small to medium-sized, they tend to be lean operations that can enhance the results they achieve with a relatively small number of well-timed investments. Long-established, popular funds can become encumbered by their own sheer size. In recognition of this problem, several of the industry's stars closed their doors to new investors for lengthy intervals in the'80s, striving to keep their growth at a manageable pace. Some big funds that have kept on scoring top marks, such as the eminently successful Fidelity Magellan Fund, have been widely publicized. But industry commentators often cite them as the exception that proves the rule. On top of that, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> suggests, the outstanding years in a fund's past may have been the work of a manager or managers who have since moved on to other endeavors. `` It's not uncommon for old funds to have new managers,'' he says. `` The manager is the key, not the fund.'' In the universe of the funds he follows, only one in five has been operating with the same people at the helm for 10 years or more. For a final test of his argument, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> checked actual performance records of new vs. older funds for various periods in more recent times through the third quarter of this year. On the list of the top 25 performers since the beginning of 1986, 56 percent were funds organized in 1980 or later. For the period since the lows after the 1987 market crash, the newcomers' share swelled to 80 percent Over the most recent 12 months, it stood at 60 percent. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>'s conclusion: Age discrimination is unwarranted when shopping for a mutual fund. `` Young funds are no problem,'' he says, `` as long as they are performing well.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On Export News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices were slightly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting new export developments, but other grain and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in listless trading. The wheat market got a boost from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Tuesday that it had targeted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for sales of another 2 million metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices in addition to the 14,200 tons remaining under a previous allocation A new wheat allocation to the Soviets has been expected since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met earlier this month. `` We knew it was coming; we did n't know when,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In other export news, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced sales of wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was rumored to have bought <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat overnight. Further support stemmed from Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announcement that an additional 3.3 million acres of land had been taken out of agricultural production and put into a soil conservation program. Ms. <PERSON> Leighty </PERSON> said about 2 million of those acres were in wheat country. In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.15 -LCB- a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.38 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $ 1.53 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with January at $ 5.78 a Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Pork belly futures were down sharply amid speculation that Thursday's weekly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> cold storage report would show a higher-than-normal net increase last month in supplies of frozen bellies. Live cattle futures were .02 cent to .15 cent lower with December at 78.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with January at 84.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with December at 53.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.25 cent lower with February at 50.35 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

 In one stroke, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has become a significant international carrier through the $ 471 million purchase of Latin American and European routes and other assets from struggling <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The long-anticipated deal, announced Tuesday, increases American's Central and South American destinations from one city in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to 20 in 15 countries. It also gives American its second <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> route in two days and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unused route authority from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. American Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said today the deal will allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to `` fully realize our aspirations'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to gain badly needed cash as it tries to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. In a news conference in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> today, noted that the deal must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, but added, `` We certainly think it should be -LRB- approved -RRB- ... This is a very good transaction.'' American, besides being the No. 1 domestic airline, serves seven Mexican destinations and about 20 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, plus has a growing presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where it has 5 percent of the market, and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The agreement followed by one day American's $ 195 million purchase from <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of a Chicago-London route, plus facilities at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. In addition, American paid $ 400,000 Monday for <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s landing rights at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. All the purchases require approval by various government agencies. In addition, the Eastern transactions must be approved by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` American has been pursuing the expansion of its international operations from some time,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` This transaction will allow our company to continue building its international network, and it will make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> a stronger competitor in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by linking that region to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s extensive domestic route system.'' The purchase includes gates at several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports currently held by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, plus Eastern facilities at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> airports. As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will drop a $ 1 billion antitrust lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, the computer reservation system owned by American's parent, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said the deal would pump $ 349 million into <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy court protection next year. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling is Miami-London route, will realize $ 102.5 million; System One, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s computer reservations system, will net $ 19.5 million through the sale of telecommunication and data processing systems needed to service the Latin American routes. `` The sale of these assets will enable <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to continue on its course of successfully rebuilding as a smaller and stronger airline for the future, with its operations centered at its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Eastern also said it would sell the 14 Lockheed-1011s it uses on the Latin American routes. The planes, which are an older, smaller version of the widebody jet, could bring in about $ 200 million, according to analysts' estimates. American, which has spent billions this year buying new aircraft to serve its expansion plans, says it is not interested in the jets. Analysts generally applauded American's purchases of the routes. They say the carrier's expansion beyond <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders is necessary if it is to become a `` player'' internationally. The deals also could have the pleasant side effect of making <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> less attractive to a corporate raider by decreasing cash and depressing earnings. `` These are good long-term moves, and if they affect earnings in the short term, they can deal with that,'' said analyst <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Daugherty </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Helane </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sounded a warning note, however. `` I really think that you do n't necessarily want to take $ 500 million or $ 200 million cash and give it to a competitor that would be out of business in a year,'' she said, referring to Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. `` You sort of have to wonder if they could buy these assets out of bankruptcy at a cheaper price than they're doing today.'' <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> shares closed Tuesday at $ 60, up $ 2.75, in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. American has been expanding vigorously this year, buying airplanes to fly its newly acquired, or sought-after routes; beginning work on a $ 400 million maintenance facility; expanding domestic operations; and fighting off a takeover from billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. American has broadened its European service significantly this year, and already has approval for more routes next year, when it will reach about 165 flights weekly to 18 <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> cities. Six years ago, it flew to none. Expansion also is under way in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, where American next year will begin flying to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The airline also is trying to add a second <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> flight. The growth has been financed through record profits, although <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> has warned the performance wo n't continue this quarter or next year.

PLC, the world's largest advertising holding company, said Wednesday that the investment company <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has increased its stake in the troubled company to 11.2 percent Southeastern, based in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, had previously declared on Sept. 18 that it owned a 10.2 percent stake in <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION>.

Southeastern has increased its shareholding to 17.788 million ordinary shares, <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> said.

 The surprise attack by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> helped push the dollar higher today, but other financial markets reacted only mildly to the military intervention. On Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average was up about 4 points to the 2,700 level by noon EST. But in the broader market, declining stocks slightly outnumbered advances on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices were unchanged to slightly higher in midday trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered troops into action following several days of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officer in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by defense forces controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Currency dealers said the dollar rose sharply against other major currencies just after the military action became known early today. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday. It started the trading day at 143.92 yen and ranged between 143.90-144 .25 yen By midday in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the dollar was up against all currencies except the yen while gold prices moved higher. The dollar remained firm in early <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealings. In times of international tension, investors often look for safe havens and usually turn to the dollar and precious metals. <PERSON> Gabriele </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said she expected the dollar to be stable in the near term because of the uncertainty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` There are still a lot of question marks,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still has a lot of support in his country ... I would n't rule him out entirely.'' But stock analysts said most investors did not view the unrest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a reason for making big changes in their strategies. `` The initial reaction is one of a non-event. It might have an impact if it becomes a prolonged situation,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, a vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed: `` We've been involved in limited -LRB- military -RRB- engagements before This looks like a military engagement that will be over shortly.'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said oil and defense stocks were getting a boost from the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invastion, however. The oil futures market initially rallied on the news amid concern that the closure of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> might disrupt oil shipments, but prices fell back later in the trading session. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the leading grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was down around 5 cents at $ 21.21 per 42-gallon barrel by midday today. The January home heating oil contract, strengthened in recent days from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation, was up 0.54 cent to 76.85 cents a gallon, after rising nearly 2 cents earlier in the trading session. `` I think the reaction to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> closure was totally irrational,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Our crude oil supplies simply wo n't be disrupted.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> passes through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> and the tankers that travel through the canal could be re-routed around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 State Comptroller <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> today began legal action to remove <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, claiming <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has used <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest savings and loan to support his `` opulent lifestyle.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> filed an administrative complaint that seeks removal of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> as chairman of the thrift. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has 21 days to either contest the complaint through a state hearing or comply with it. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> said it would oppose efforts to oust <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and called <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' action was self-serving. `` This campaign is clearly aimed at generating favorable publicity for the comptroller and supporting his own re-election campaign whatever the cost to <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, its shareholders and its customers,'' the company said in a statement. The complaint charged that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> employees to perform personal services, charged the savings and loan for thousands of dollars in personal bills and engaged in other questionable financial transactions. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of the association, and generally treated a federally insured financial institution and public company as it if were his own public piggy bank,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in the complaint. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s actions were unsound and unsafe business practices that violated his duty as an officer of a financial institution, the complaint charged. The complaint was filed 11 days after federal regulators, also citing <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s lavish spending practices, ordered the institution to stop squandering its assets on fine art, sailboats, excessive executive salaries and other personal expenses. <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, spokesman for the comptroller's office, said the action today was highly unusual. `` But it's a fairly unusual institution,'' <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> said. The complaint questioned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s $ 4.8 million in salary between January 1988 and September of this year during a time when the thrift suffered operating losses of $ 76 million before taxes. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> also bought some $ 30 million in art in 1988 without <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' approval, spent thousands of dollars on executives' hotels bills and used high-prices limousines to ferry the thrift's officers around <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the complaint charged The complaint also noted that $ 150,000 in <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> assets, including security equipment, video cameras, office supplies, telephones and air conditioners, were kept at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s home on <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. When federal regulators made their charges earlier this month, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> issued a statement saying he had turned around a previously insolvent thrift and reduced its losses. `` We have achieved that without one penny of federal assistance while investing millions of dollars in developing a first-rate institution with the financial strength in place to meet the need of our customers,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said at the time.

<HEAD>Economy Grew At an Annual Rate of 3 Percent July Through September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent from July through September, the government said today, but analysts say it has slowed dramatically during the fourth quarter. The economic deterioration has led many anlaysts to urge the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. The central bank did add money to the banking system late Tuesday, leading to the belief that it might permit interest rates to fall again. In its final report on third-quarter economic activity, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product was revised upward 0.3 percentage point from the 2.7 percent rate reported last month. Many economists had predicted no change from November in the figure released today. The change was attributed to another upward revision in net exports and a downward revision in personal consumption. The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and its broadest measure of economic health. The report bore good news for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of restraining inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent during the July-September period, unchanged from last month's report. It is the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s high-interest policy that is blamed, in part, for the fourth-quarter sluggishness, particularly in the automobile and other manufacturing industries. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policymaking arm, met privately Monday and Tuesday to consider monetary policy but, as usual, did not announce whether it would permit rates to continue to fall However, the key federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, dropped to 8 7-16 percent from about 8 -LCB- percent late Tueday. Analysts said they expected a target of 8 \ percent for the rate Besides manufacturing sluggishness, other disruptions in fourth-quarter growth are expected from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft strike, the lingering effects of Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay-area </LOCATION> earthquake. In a companion report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax profits of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations fell 5.4 percent in the third quarter. That was a revision from the 7.2 percent decline reported last month. Corporate profits have dropped for three consecutive quarters. They were down 0.3 percent in the first quarter and 1.1 percent in the second. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, was revised to show a 5.6 percent growth rate compared to the 6.2 percent gain reported last month. The various changes left the GNP expanding in the third quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.16 trillion. Today's report was the third on the July-September GNP. In its initial estimate in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the third-quarter economy would grow at a 2.5 percent annual rate. Last month's initial revision was due mainly to better-than-expected trade performance. The September trade deficit, which hit a five-year low, was not available when the advance estimate was made in October. Today's revision reflects additional data that has become available. While the economy surprised many analysts with its 3 percent growth durin the first nine months of the year, it has declined significantly this quarter and some economists fear it will drop below 1 percent and perhaps even trip into a recession. The administration is forecasting a 2.7 percent growth rate for all of 1989. The fourth-quarter GNP would have to advance 1.6 percent to meet that goal. Much of the growth in the third quarter was attributed to robust automobile sales that were driven by sales incentives. Automakers dropped the incentives with the introduction of 1990 models in October and sales plummeted. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, noted that incentives are being restored and predicted a pickup in sales starting in January. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s high-interest policy is intended to curb inflation. As inflation appeared to moderate, the central bank has gradually eased interest rates since last June. But many economists say rates still are too high and are stifling growth, even threatening an end to an unprecedented seven years of peacetime growth. `` Fourth-quarter growth is about 0.8 percent,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, economic forecasting director at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said growth in the first three months of 1990 will be about 1 percent. `` But I'm expecting a couple of prime rate cuts, and if we do n't see them we might turn our forecast to the negative,'' he said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also suggested the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> should consider further easing interest rates `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will have to move to reduce interest rates in order to keep the economy going next year, but I think they're going to have to do it slowly,'' he said

 <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said today it was prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if its bondholders did not agree to financial restructuring. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> as part of its $ 2.4 billion acquisition of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> last year. The Tampa-based building materials company is currently fighting a $ 3 billion asbestos-related lawsuit. The proposed bankruptcy move would be the first involving a large company acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, the leader among leveraged buyout firms, and could have an effect on the junk bond market that has financed many takeovers. Hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected to be made Dec. 27 if an exchange offer for $ 624 million worth of the company's bonds were not accepted by at least 80 percent of the company's bondholders. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has apparently failed to persuade a group of <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>'s senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial restructuring of the company. `` If the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their current terms and conditions, <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> and certain of its subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. If the offer is not accepted, <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> faces the prospect of having to repay its notes in full, which it told bondholders at a meeting Tuesday that it could not do. <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>'s financial problems began last summer when it was named in the class-action lawsuit. Because of the suit, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to sell off <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s assets. And without the proceeds from the sales, the company can not meet its upcoming debt payments.

 The dollar was mixed against major foreign currencies Wednesday in hectic but thin European trading after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Gold prices were lower. Traders said the dollar was boosted early in the trading day by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action and by an unexpected upward revision in the third-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth rate. The dollar stabilized later in the day, traders said, and then slipped back in mild profit-taking. `` We think -LRB- the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation -RRB- is very much a smoke screen and an excuse to buy dollars,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer. `` If the market was genuinely frightened from the news, why did n't gold also gain?'' Investors traditionally turn to the dollar and gold as safe havens in times of turmoil. Traders cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from dollar movements in the market, thinned by the holiday season. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to a closing 144.23 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell to 143.90 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.6052 from $ 1.6005 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7355 West German marks, down from 1.7365; 1.5585 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 5.9165 French francs, down from 5.9300; 1.9720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9575; 1,288.00 Italian lire, down from 1,291.25; and 1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1613 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 413.50 a troy ounce, down from $ 413.75 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal fell to a closing bid of $ 413 dollars, down from $ 414 dollars bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid $ 412.04. Silver bullion fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 5.56 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.57 bid late Tuesday.

 Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading Wednesday, as the market reacted with enthusiasm to Wall Street's recovery from its Tuesday lows Selective buying, the re-emergence of takeover speculation in the composite insurance sector, and the continuation of a stock shortage also helped the market, dealers said. Still, the market was lethargic despite good volume, dealers said. `` People are conscious of the strengths of the market, but many are still happy to sit on the sidelines,'' said one dealer, adding that business was winding down ahead of the approaching holidays. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 18.6 points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,360.7. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 13.5 points at 1,866.0 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 7.53 points to close at 1,280.69. Volume amounted to a healthy 552.9 million shares compared with 589.2 million shares Tuesday.

 Political instability and a staggering economy are threatening to bust <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s booming market for foreign-office space. Dozens of highrise office buildings are opening in the capital this year and next, at a time when many overseas companies are reducing operations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or putting off new investment. `` It's going to be survival of the fittest,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchon </PERSON> of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, property consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s biggest building project. `` We have a baby market here, and things have been made worse by the current economic situation.'' <PERSON> Pitchon </PERSON> estimated that by the end of 1990 there will be nearly double the amount of office space currently required by the 1,100 foreign companies with offices in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It will be a drastic turnaround from even a year ago, when more than half of all foreigners were working out of Chinese hotel rooms with peeling paint, antiquated telephones and stalled elevators. Foreign companies began moving representatives into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> around 1980 with the advent of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s economic reforms and open door policy. But it was not until 1985, with the opening of the 29-story <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CITIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- building, that a select few companies had their first access to modern office space. In 1986 the Holiday Inn Lido complex of hotel, apartments and offices opened for businessmen and the next year the 23-story Noble Tower, a project marked by bitter disputes between its Chinese and Canadian partners, began taking in tenants. But that still provided only about 57,000 square yards of office space. By next year, the figure will be five times as great. Heading the newcomers is the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kerry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. That features a 38-story tower with 61,000 square yards of office space, two 30-story luxury apartment buildings and two hotels with more than 1,000 rooms Among the competition is the Jing Guang Center, a 51-story office-apartment-hotel built with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Japanese participation; the 20-story Fortune Building financed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Hua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Norwegian-Chinese apartment-business project with 23,000 square yards of office space; and Capital Mansion, a <ORGANIZATION> CITIC </ORGANIZATION> undertaking with a 52-story office-apartment building Their openings, however, are clouded by the June military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and an austerity policy that has stalled the economy and left in doubt the future direction of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-oriented reforms. Few companies have left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but many have trimmed expatriate staff or canceled plans for further investment. Many foreign businesses likely will wait one or two years before deciding the extent of their commitment to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, some real estate experts say, and investing in costly new office quarters will not be a top priority. Most of the projects are months behind schedule because of typical construction delays in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> compounded by work stoppages during the political turmoil of this spring. The World Trade, originally slated to cost $ 380 million, now will require $ 450 million due to expense overruns. Many projects, such as the two-tower Asia-Pacific Building financed partly by Singaporean and Japanese funds, have asked for rescheduling of loans and extensions of joint venture contracts because of expected slow returns on investment. The Chinese partner in the World Trade Center, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, has already agreed to extend the life of the joint venture from 20 to 30 years. At least one major project, a planned 17-story hotel and office building involving the Japanese builder <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Komuten </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, halted construction after June. `` We have n't abandoned the project,'' <PERSON> Takenaka </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Fujio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. But he said the project team is waiting for the domestic situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to return to normal. Another project, <ORGANIZATION> CITIC </ORGANIZATION>'s Capital Mansion, has been hit by construction delays and financing problems and, according to some foreign real estate experts, is a `` white elephant.'' Capital Mansion Deputy General Manager <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said the building will not open until the end of 1990. He expressed confidence the project would succeed, but said it is n't signing contracts yet and `` we face serious competition.'' `` It's a race against time,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, chief operations officer of the Jing Guang Center. Those already taking in tenants have a big advantage, he said. The Jing Guang began filling its offices and apartments in December and the World Trade Center will have 115 tenants, about 60 percent occupancy, by the end of January. The Fortune Building, promoted by its Japanese managers as a high-technology office complex with a satellite transmission network, has about 40 mostly Japanese tenants and foresees occupancy of about 65 percent next year. The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> Hua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which wo n't open until next summer, has leased only 20 percent of its office space and like many others is offering `` flexible terms'' to attract customers. The center is asking $ 35 per square yard a month, but Sales Manager <PERSON> Dorophy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leung </PERSON> said `` this price is negotiable and we will offer discounts.'' The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has also cut its rates from near $ 40 to about $ 35 a square yard. Office buildings also may face competition from newly built hotels, which face an even greater glut in the near future because of the post-June collapse of the tourist market. The State Council-owned Capital Hotel, with an occupancy rate of 30 percent, recently began advertising guest suites for use as offices. According to one survey, there will be about 24,000 rooms in Western-style hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> by 1991, double that of 1988 and seven times the figure in 1983. Developers said the oversupply problem should eventually work itself out, but much depends on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political stability and economic health. `` It could be a boom town,'' said the World Trade Center's <PERSON> Pitchon </PERSON>. `` And it could be a ghost town.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would phase out production of industrial chemicals at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> plant and take a $ 200 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings to reflect that and other restructuring steps. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> would scale back production at the plant and planned to sell its industrial chemical product lines and technologies next year, Chairman <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The industrial chemical business no longer fits our corporate strategy,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, adding that the North Haven plant had become unprofitable because of a number of factors, including obsolescence, competition and shrinking markets. Most of the 178 jobs at the plant would be phased out by the end of 1992, some through normal attrition and early retirement incentives, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> said 65 percent of the $ 200 million charge was attributable to the phaseout of the North Haven plant, while the other 35 percent was due to a previously-announced special retirement plan and other one-time expenses. Industrial chemicals include benzephonone, used in soaps and perfumes, DCNA, used in dyes and as an agricultural fungicide, and dichlorobenzidine, used in making yellow ink and dye pigments, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON> said.

 On a conference room wall at <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters hangs a 20-foot-long picture frame, crammed with hundreds of snapshots and school photos of children. They're pictures kids just sent on their own, says <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, usually with a note about how they did on a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> video game. For a company that gets thousands of photos, tens of thousands of letters and millions of phone calls from customers, 1990 may pose a problem: How to keep that loyalty. With a <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> in one out of nearly four American households, toy industry watchers wonder whether the market is getting saturated. `` I look at <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> as a fad that is moving into its fourth year,'' says <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. If for no other reason, he said, that makes <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> vulnerable to a slump. `` We've certainly seen the predictions of the doomsayers that we've reached saturation,'' says White. `` That certainly has n't been the case. Nevertheless, gamesters and marketeers at <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> are hustling to keep their top-selling toy fresh among customers. Beyond scouting new and more detailed games, ideas range from `` store within a store'' retail displays to marketing tie-ins with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> to a feature-length movie. This Christmas, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> introduced its hand-held game, `` Game Boy,'' which it hopes will sell 1 million units. It forecasts selling 9 million of the entertainment system consoles this year. By late 1990, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> plans to have its `` NES Network'' running, which will allow the machines to be used to trade securities and mutual funds through <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> and for game players to compete in nationwide tournaments. At <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in this <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb, the bustling hallways, jingling phones and jammed shipping docks during the Christmas selling season testified to the prosperity of a company that's had the nation's No. 1 toy the past three years The subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> projects more than $ 2.7 billion in retail sales for 1989, $ 1 billion more than last year and nearly nine times as much as in 1986 This year, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also subsidiaries of Japanese companies, brought out competing machines offering more computing power than <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s. <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also has introduced a competitor to Game Boy, called Lynx. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> claims a 79 percent share of a video game market it estimates at $ 3.4 billion. Its Japanese parent may introduce a more high-powered system in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> next summer, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> expects to have sold 20 million video game systems by the end of this year, with the devices in 22 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> households. But <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said he thinks sales will drop sharply in 1990. Toy crazes, he says, just do n't last over three or four years. `` I think when the fad goes we'll see a sharp contraction of sales, anywhere from 40 to 70 percent over two years,'' he said. Still, he said, that would leave video games as the largest category within the toy industry. Many toy makers are hoping <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> crashes, says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlat </PERSON>, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine. `` It probably will be down, but a lot of it is wishful thinking,'' he said. `` No company has been really able to hold onto a smash and be able to manage it in the past. It's always been a boom and bust cycle,'' <PERSON> Carlat </PERSON> said. `` It does n't look like that is going to happen with <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>. People in the toy business use the term ` soft landing.''' <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> introduced its game system in 1983 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and has sold it to 37 percent of households there. The goal, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> says, is similar market penetration in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> has been credited with reviving the video game industry, which had all but vanished by the early 1980s because of poor quality software. It did so by carefully contolling licensing and manufacture of the games that can be played on its system. White says there are encouraging signs of market longevity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two years ago, he said, 75 percent to 80 percent of the primary users of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> games were boys aged 6 to 14. The interest has broadened, he said, so that segment only represents 46 percent of the main users today. Men 18 and older now make up 30 percent of the primary users, while women and girls comprise a 24 percent share, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` The biggest change has been the widespread adoption of the <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> as a true entertainment option'' to television, video cassettes or stereos, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> does its best to cultivate fan loyalty, <PERSON> White </PERSON> says. It has 400 game counselors at its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters, who handle 140,000 calls a week from stumped players. Its magazine, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, has 1.8 million subscribers. The company gets 15,000 letters a week, and a roomful of writers responds to each personally. `` You've got to bond with them,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> says. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> has lent its name to 200 licensed products, from sweatshirts to dolls, bedsheets to breakfast cereal. It's also set up about 5,000 `` World of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'' store displays to sell the merchandise. In addition, there are two television series. Earlier this month a Nintendo-themed movie, `` The Wizard,'' opened nationally. While the licensing earns money, it also is a powerful marketing tool for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Likewise, he said, a Christmas-time promotion with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> broadens <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s advertising. White, however, said the tie-ins and licensing deals still are secondary to the core of the industry, the games. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> has sold 101 million individual games, and hopes for a new hit when it brings out <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> 3 next year, a far more intricate version of this year's best-selling game, he said.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, paced by moderate losses in the soybean market linked in part to the closing of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>.

Soybean prices had slipped lower in the two previous trading sessions. At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.13 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.38 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to -RCB- cent lower with March at $ 1.52 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with January at $ 5.74 \

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Billionaire <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> reportedly is among bidders weighing a possible purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s but the department store chain's troubled owner, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, declined Wednesday to confirm <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s interest. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON> said the company intends to maintain silence for the duration of the sale process. The identity of the bidders will not be disclosed and all negotiations are confidential. The only thing the company has been willing to say in the past is that no more than five or six parties would advance to the second stage of the bidding. No word on who will acquire the 17-store upscale chain is expected until sometime in February, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said on Dec. 8, the day the initial stage of the sale process was concluded. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, also declined to comment on a report Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal that said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is one of the bidders who will advance to round 2. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is known primarily as a property developer. Included in his vast holdings are an airline and a stake in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> department store chain, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s announced on Wednesday that, at the urging of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and another stockholder, the retailer had hired the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to `` consider strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including the possible sale of the company.'' The retailer said there was no assurance that any transaction would occur. Ms. <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON> dismissed speculation that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might favor a sale of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s to raise money to help pay for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s. She said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who each own 27.2 percent of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s, have been advocating changes for years in the way <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s has been run. She said she would n't rule out the possibility that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might pursue a takeover of the share of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s he does n't already control. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s operates 11 stores in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area. Besides <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the bidders for <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s include shopping center owner <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tokyu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a group led by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> stores, the Journal said, citing unidentified sources. An investment group headed by <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> also is among the contenders, a spokeswoman for the chain, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON>, an adviser to <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> and a senior partner with the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Weil </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gotshal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION>, told the Journal that the <ORGANIZATION> Traub </ORGANIZATION> group is trying to arrange financing for a possible bid. He said the group is engaged in serious discussions with potential financial partners. A sixth bidder, possibly Japanese, also is believed to be involved in the bidding, the Journal said. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Canadian real estate company with extensive retail holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was forced to put <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s up for sale in September as part of a plan to cope with a severe cash squeeze and an enormous debt load. Among the stores besides New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate umbrella are: <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, The <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s.

<TEXT>
 State officials took action Wednesday to oust the head of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest savings and loan, claiming he used $ 45 million in depositors' money to bankroll an art collection and extravagant lifestyle. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, has 21 days to resign or contest a complaint filed by Comptroller <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. A statement released by <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> would `` vigorously oppose'' removal. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of the association and generally treated a federally insured financial institution and public company as it if were his own public piggy bank,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in the complaint. The complaint claimed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> violated his duty as officer of a financial institution by using <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> employees to perform personal services, charging the company for personal bills and buying luxuries. It cited $ 30 million in art bought with <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> funds, including $ 12 million paid for <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudens </PERSON>' `` Portrait of a Man as Mars.'' Some of the paintings were kept at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> home before state regulators ordered them sold. The complaint also questioned <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s $ 4.8 million salary from January 1988 to September 1989, when the thrift suffered pre-tax operating losses of $ 76 million. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement the charges were not justified and the thrift had improved net worth signficantly during <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s six years in charge, and accused the comptroller of a `` campaign of harassment and disinformation.'' <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 9 billion in assets, is <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest thrift and the 22nd largest in the country. It has 70 branches, most in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But the thrift has steadily lost money for more than a year, including $ 9.1 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. The comptroller's complaint was filed 12 days after federal regulators, also citing <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION>'s lavish spending practices, ordered the institution to stop squandering assets. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> barred <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> from increasing executives' salaries, ordered it to sell a $ 233,000 sailboat and prohibited <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> from spending any more money on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s yacht, the Grand Cru. Other expenses questioned by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> include: _ A $ 6.1 million <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> loan to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> to buy and improve his house and property, as well as payment by <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> of telephone, garbage and lawn bills in 1986-87 _ A $ 5 million executive retirement system begun in 1986 with deposits in an English bank <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> contends the system has insufficient documentation. _ $ 1.4 million a year to lease a corporate jet and hangar at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as well as $ 26,000 a year for a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> limousine, $ 40,000 to purchase a <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> limousine kept in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and $ 33,000 in other car expenses. _ $ 363,000 for security guard service at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s home the past two years. _ $ 150,000 in bank assets kept at <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s home, including security equipment, video cameras, office supplies, telephones and air conditioners. _ $ 47,000 spent by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in 1988 during a 35-night stay at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel. The average daily expense was $ 1,186. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> has sought federal approval to sell 63 branches and their accounts to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Financial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CenTrust </ORGANIZATION> also is planning to convert from a state charter to a federal charter

 The energy futures market ended mixed in volatile trading Wednesday, erasing much of its earlier gains that stemmed from news of a sudden <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strike in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Prices for crude and refined petroleum products had been up sharply earlier in the trading day Wednesday on fears that the closure of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, following the surprise attack by American forces, might disrupt oil shipments. But analysts said the market had over-reacted. `` I think the reaction to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> closure was totally irrational,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` Our crude oil supplies simply wo n't be disrupted.'' Analysts said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> passes through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> because the waterway is too small to handle large tankers. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the leading grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was down 7 cents to settle at $ 21.21 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract was up 11 cents on Tuesday. Among refined petroleum products, the January wholesale home heating oil contract, supported in recent days from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation, rose 0.75 cent to settle at 75.76 cents a gallon. On Tuesday, the contract gained 0.35 cent. January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.58 cent in the previous session, ended 0.71 cent lower to 53.22 cents a gallon.

 The stock market drifted through a trendless session Wednesday, registering no strong reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.68 to 2,687.93, extending its loss over the last five trading days to 73.16 points. But advancing issues nosed out declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 749 down and 492 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 176.52 million shares, down from 186.06 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 216.34 million shares.

 The dollar finished mostly lower Wednesday in foreign exchange trading in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after ending mixed overseas in what dealers called a muted response to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Gold investors appeared to discard news of the military action, as prices edged higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after falling in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a bid for a troy ounce of gold at $ 413.05 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $ 1.30 from Tuesday's late bid The dollar wound up lower against every major currency except the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it rose against the yen, Canadian dollar and Dutch guilder, but fell against other major currencies. Dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the dollar rose early in the trading day in reaction to news of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But the dollar reversed course midway through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading day when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> took steps to inject reserves into the financial system, a move that was viewed as a sign that it may be encouraging lower interest rates. Falling interest rates reduce demand for dollars because the decline cuts the yields available to foreigners on their dollar-denominated investments. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president for foreign exchange and precious metals at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said trading was relatively light all day. `` You could tell there was no real conviction,'' he said, referring to the market's assessment of the impact of both the military action and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move to make more money available within the financial system. He said the market viewed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action as `` a sign of strength'' but recognized the move was a `` limited regional action'' which was not likely to have global ramifications. The subsequent decline in the dollar also came on low volume, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said, because traders remember that they misinterpreted a similar move by the central bank a few weeks ago as an indication it was easing its credit policy. He also noted that as the end of the year approaches, banks that otherwise would be active in the currency markets are not trading. `` Most of the major banks have squared their banks for the year,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 144.23 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.90 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar edged up to 143.93 yen from 143.65 yen late Tuesday. The dollar fell against the British pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.6052 from $ 1.6005 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound rose to $ 1.6060 from $ 1.6010 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Tuesday, included: 1.7320 West German marks, down from 1.7365; 5.9125 French francs, down from 5.9275; 1.5555 Swiss francs, down from 1.5565; 1,288.50 Italian lire, down from 1,289.25; and 1.16095 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16085. Selected late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7355 West German marks, down from 1.7365; 1.5585 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 5.9165 French francs, down from 5.9300; 1.9720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9575; 1,288.00 Italian lire, down from 1,291.25; and 1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1613. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold for current delivery rose $ 1.70 a troy ounce to $ 413.60. But earlier in the day, gold prices fell. Gold dropped to a late bid of $ 413.50 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from $ 413.75 bid late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the metal fell to a closing bid of $ 413 an ounce, down from $ 414 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid $ 412.04. On the Comex, silver for current delivery rose 2.1 cents an ounce to $ 5.548.

The move also postponed what would have been two firsts: the first former <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> holding to go public since a $ 6 billion takeover in 1986 and the first black-owned company to be listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. TLC <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> on Tuesday canceled the offering of 18.5 million shares of stock priced from $ 9 to $ 10.50 a share. A successful offering would have raised between $ 167 million and $ 194 million. The company, controlled by investor <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, cited weak market conditions and a lack of interest from institutional investors in canceling the plan to offer a 35 percent interest to the public. `` It's not what I would call a hot new issues market,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Econometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which analyzes new stock issues. `` Offerings tend to be overpriced.'' `` My sense is that there is very little demand for offerings from individual investors, and institutions are dominating the market,'' said <PERSON> Fosback </PERSON>, who did not recommend the TLC <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> issue. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumbach </PERSON>, a new issues analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report that the <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> shares were priced at about 20 times what he estimated the company's 1989 earnings would be if it already were public There have been 194 initial public offerings by companies this year through Tuesday, down from 222 in the same 1988 period and 516 in the same 1987 period, according to <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The value of IPOs rose 4.3 percent from 1988 to $ 5.5 billion, but dropped 56.6 percent from $ 12.8 billion in the 1987 period, the figures showed. A group of investors led by <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> bought <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON>'s international foods operations for $ 985 million in December 1987 The entire company was taken private the previous year by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the leader in debt-financed takeovers known as leveraged buyouts. TLC <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> raised $ 875 million through asset sales to help pay off debt, company officials said. They said the remaining $ 34 million in acquisition debt was retired this week, but the company still has close to $ 170 million in long-term debt. As of Sept. 30, the company had assets of $ 624 million, including about $ 154 million in cash. It expects 1989 operating profits of $ 75 million on sales of $ 1.1 billion. `` The market for initial public equity offerings has tightened up in general,'' <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` We thought it was an attractive window to access the public equity markets,'' he said. `` However, the window did not appear as attractive as it might have been.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said the company has not ruled out issuing the stock at a later time. TLC <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> owns 15 companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Franprix </ORGANIZATION>, a food wholesaler in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> area; <LOCATION> Tayto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s largest snack food company; and seven ice cream distributors in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Climb Higher On Freeze Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Orange juice futures prices climbed higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as fears of a weekend freeze in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus belt intensified. On other commodity markets, sugar futures fell sharply; coffee futures gained in reaction to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>; precious metals advanced; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans fell; and livestock and meat futures retreated. Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice settled 1.9 cents to 3.05 cents higher with the contract for delivery in January up 2 cents at $ 1.3445 a pound. Freezing temperatures are almost certain to reach <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s citrus region this weekend as one of the most powerful cold-air masses of the decade lumbers down from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a meteorologist who tracks the impact of the weather on commodities for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This air mass is so strong that even the fringe of it has potential to cause some damage across the citrus belt,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said `` Now it's just a matter of how much damage.'' The coldest temperatures, ranging from the lower 20s in the northern reaches of the fruit region to the lower 30s in the south, are expected on Friday night and Saturday night, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. With temperatures that cold for an extended period, he said, trees could be damaged as well as fruit, which could cut into production for years to come. Sugar futures prices plunged on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to a <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> court ruling that could result in a rapid movement of supplies out of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday overturned the Brazilian government's decision to withhold sugar export licenses from three trade houses in a bid to divert sugar to the nation's fuel alcohol program. Sugar futures finished .32 cent to 1.14 cents lower with January at 12.76 cents a pound. Coffee futures prices made strong gains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on supply concerns prompted in part by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was closed to traffic Wednesday as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces launched a surprise assault in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an attempt to capture <LOCATION> Panamian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The incident created uncertainty about coffee shipments from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Coffee futures settled 1.12 cents to 2.13 cents higher with March at 78.14 cents a pound. The military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> also helped boost precious metals futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold futures settled $ 1.40 to $ 1.70 higher with December at $ 413.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.6 cents higher with December at $ 5.448 a troy ounce. Energy futures finished mixed after initially surging on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> news. But heating oil for near-term delivery continued its dramatic rally, rising for the 15th of the last 16 sessions on weather-driven worries about tightening supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 10 cents lower with February at $ 21.21 a barrel; heating oil was .59 cent lower to .75 cent higher with January at 75.76 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .71 cent lower with January at 53.22 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, paced by moderate losses in the soybean market linked partly to the closing of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Wheat futures settled unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 4.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.38 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with March at $ 1.52 \ a bushel; soybeans were 3 -RCB- cents to 6 cents lower with January at $ 5.73 -RCB- Livestock and meat futures finished lower, led by limit losses in the pork belly market amid disappointment over the government's slow pace in buying pork bellies to ship to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and expectations that monthly <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report due out on Thursday will show a net increase in supplies of frozen bellies Live cattle settled .10 cent to .55 cent lower with December at 78.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .15 cent lower with January at 84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent to .85 cent lower with December at 52.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 49.60 cents a pound.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said Wednesday his deal to buy foreign routes and other assets of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> should be approved by government regulators `` in the national interest.'' Failure to allow the deal would invite greater control of international air travel by foreign carriers, <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said a press conference called to discuss details of the $ 471 million purchase announced Tuesday. The complex deal with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gives American control of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s prized Latin American routes and would greatly enhance American's presence in foreign markets. The purchase is subject to review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> departments and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Chapter 11 reorganization. `` We think it benefits consumers, the citizens of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s shareholders and employees ... -LRB- and -RRB- benefits every <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, have expressed qualms about whether international route authorities, granted by governments, should be sold. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said the deal gives <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> needed cash as it reorganizes into a carrier that is focusing on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and would give the international routes to a carrier that can `` use them more effectively.'' Since foreign governments restrict the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers allowed to fly to their countries, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s financial difficulties presented <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> with `` a major opportunity'' to realize its ambitions to become a major international carrier. American wants to expand in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, he added, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> remains very restrictive. `` American is a fast-growing company and we plan to continue that expansion through the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. The price of shares in American's parent <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 1.25 to $ 58.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. The leader of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which began the crippling March 4 strike that led to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy five days later, said the proposed deal should be rejected. `` Quite honestly, I do n't look for this thing to get any quick approval,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` If there's any credibility with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> people, I would highly doubt that thing would be approved.'' But, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said, `` It seems that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> gets what he wants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He seems to have <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> completely wired.'' If government review results in approval of the deal, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s daily departures out of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will rise from the current 41 to about 80 in the second half of 1990. The increase would include 25 more daily domestic departures. Eastern, which says it is `` de-hubbing'' its home city, is <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s No. 1 carrier with 76 daily departures. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s expansion in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> will add about 2,000 jobs there. American plans to absorb some 2,600 to 2,700 employees in the <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> will begin serving, American officials said. American spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Martelle </PERSON> said the total includes all Eastern employees in those countries, employees of four <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ground handling companies in which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had interest, and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> computer reservations system, System One. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolara </PERSON>, an American senior vice president, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would consider hiring some of the more than 2,000 Eastern pilots who were told the carrier had no jobs for them when they ended their strike last month. <PERSON> Dolara </PERSON> said, though, there was no commitment to hiring any <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees other than the ground personnel already working for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in the Latin countries. The deal increases American's Central and South American destinations from one city in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to 20 in 15 countries. The package also includes a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> route and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unused authority to fly from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Besides being the No. 1 domestic airline, American serves seven Mexican destinations and about 20 in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. It also has a growing presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where it has 5 percent of the market, and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The purchase includes gates at several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports currently held by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, plus Eastern facilities at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> airports. As part of the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> will drop a $ 1 billion antitrust lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> SABRE </ORGANIZATION>, the computer reservation system owned by AMR. <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> paid full value for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets, not extra money to settle the litigation. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said the deal would pump $ 349 million into Eastern. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling the Miami-London route, will realize $ 102.5 million. System One will net $ 19.5 million through the sale of telecommunication and data-processing systems needed to service the Latin American routes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday announced completion of a corporate restructuring that includes the sale of its worldwide hotel business and formation of a new company to operate its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos Ramada shareholders approved the revised restructuring plan earlier this month, agreeing to accept $ 1 and one share of stock in the new company, <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> stock. Gaming regulators in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> approved the plan a short time later. Hong Kong-based New World Hotel -LRB- Holdings -RRB- Ltd. acquired <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION>'s more than 800 hotels and the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> name for $ 540 million. The company said it will operate 108 international hotels, including 14 <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renaissance </ORGANIZATION> hotels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, under the name <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Fiarfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, will operate or franchise <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Rodeway Inns worldwide. <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Grau </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the new <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> acquired the Ramada hotel business to quickly increase its share of the worldwide market. `` In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> is a highly regarded hotelier known for its ownership stake in the <ORGANIZATION> Landmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, rated one of the top 10 in the world,'' <PERSON> Grau </PERSON> said. `` Once they decided to develop their hotel interests on a global basis, rather than start from scratch, they opted to buy an existing international name with strong management.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> will be based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, but its regional office for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grau </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Aztar </ORGANIZATION>, the new company created by the restructuring, will operate the <ORGANIZATION> Tropworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> and Entertainment Resort in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> and Casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> and Casino in <LOCATION> Laughlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Parent of Jim Walter Corp. Faces Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company said Wednesday it was prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in what would be a first among large firms taken private by buyout specialists <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> formed <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as part of its $ 2.4 billion takeover of the building materials company last year A bankruptcy court filing by the company could inject fresh jitters into the junk-bond market that has financed such takeovers. Hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected to be made Dec. 27 if an exchange offer for $ 624 million worth of the company's bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of the company's bondholders. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has apparently failed to persuade a group of <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>'s senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial restructuring of the company. `` If the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their current terms and conditions, <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> and certain of its subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11,'' said <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>. If the offer is not accepted, <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> faces the prospect of having to repay its notes in full, which it told bondholders at a meeting Tuesday that it could not do. A Chapter 11 filing would blemish the record of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>, considered the dean of the leveraged buyout artists with the $ 25 billion <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> deal to its credit. But the Hillsborough firm has some peculiar problems, which are not necessarily symptomatic of widespread weakness among LBOs, experts said. `` It's not going to be that devastating,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, publisher of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> interest rate newsletter and a critic of leveraged buyouts. `` <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> had problems of its own that had nothing to do with the takeover.'' The biggest problem, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said, came last summer when <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> was hit with a $ 3 billion asbestos-related lawsuit. Because of the class-action suit, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to sell off <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>'s assets. And without the proceeds from the sales, the company can not meet its upcoming debt payments. <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON> is the third company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> to encounter financial difficulties in recent months. In August, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Seaman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Furniture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading furniture retailer, could not meet its debt payments and might not be able to continue operating. The company's debt payments were later rescheduled successfully. <ORGANIZATION> SCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of which <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> owns 45 percent, is also involved in an exchange offer that is facing resistance from bondholders. But neither of those <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> holdings is as large as <PERSON> Hillsborough </PERSON>.

 Two clothing makers have joined merchandise credit firms in suspending business with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied department stores as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial situation. <ORGANIZATION> Finity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportswear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said that if the retailers seek protection from creditors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, his company would have to demand prepayment on its next shipment, which is Jan. 20. `` A delay in our payment would be very devastating,'' he said. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied, based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, warned in documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that they could run out of operating cash as early as January if lenders do not restructure their $ 7 billion debt. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Leslie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, said the company wants to continue business with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied, but can not risk having the retailers seek protection in bankruptcy court. `` We'd have to settle claims with something less than a full amount. That is a risk we can not afford to run,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Solo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday began advising clients, including clothing manufacturers and companies that lend money to finance merchandise shipments, not to ship goods to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stores. `` <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s intention to do business is very sincere, but their liquidity problem has turned into a very dangerous situation that needs to be addressed immediately,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a Solo credit analyst. Solo's advice came after <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> Group-Factoring and <ORGANIZATION> Heller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, merchandise lenders, cut off credit to such Campeau-owned stores as <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for corporate communications in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said the company was withholding comment on the companies' decisions. <ORGANIZATION> Liz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claiborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaus </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Heckler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Investing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are continuing shipments. `` We strongly believe management there will resolve this situation and any questions will be answered,'' said <PERSON> Heckler </PERSON> executive vice president <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The firm makes <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> underwear and girl's sportswear under the <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vittadini </PERSON> label.

<HEAD>Lang Plans to Make Ms. an Ad-Free Bimonthly Magazine, Names New Editor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The new owner of Ms. said Wednesday he plans to resume publication of the magazine every other month starting next spring, and named feminist activist and author <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> as its editor in chief. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Lang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> assumed control of Ms. in mid-October, had previously disclosed that when the magazine resumed publication, it would no longer accept advertising and he reaffirmed that on Wednesday. The magazine, founded in 1972, had been a monthly but was not profitable and had often been at odds with advertisers over its editorial content. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> had said publishing the magazine without ads would relieve it from `` external pressures'' and enable its editorial staff to concentrate on pursuing issues important to women without concerns about advertiser backlash. The last issue of Ms. magazine was dated November. No specific date was set for resumption of publication as a bimonthly. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> was unavailable for comment on the latest decisions, but a spokeswoman said that subscribers would soon be getting a letter of explanation from <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON>, a co-founder of the magazine who remains a consultant to the publication. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> would outline the plans for Ms. and offer readers a chance to get issues of Working Woman, Working Mother or similar magazines in the months remaining before Ms. resumes publication. <ORGANIZATION> Lang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> owns Working Woman and <PERSON> Working </PERSON> <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> as well as the teen magazine Sassy and Success, a magazine for entrepreneurs. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, the new editor, replaces <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, who had held that post since November 1987 and remains as editor-at-large of the magazine. Ms. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> had been part of a group including management that bought Ms. and Sassy in July 1988 from the Australia-based media company <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Terms of <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>'s acquisition of a controlling interest in that company have not been disclosed. Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> has written 12 books, including `` The Demon Lover: On the Sexuality of Terrorism,'' `` Sisterhood is Powerful'' and `` Sisterhood is Global.'' She was a contributing editor to Ms. from 1974 to 1987. She also was described as a founder and leader of the feminist movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was a creator of the Sisterhood is <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a feminist research organization. She was said to be unavailable for comment on her new job. Asked why <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> felt a new editor was needed for the magazine, Ms. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said he felt `` a new editor will have a fresh perspective on the magazine.'' The last issue of Ms. had actress <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> on the cover, but Ms. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said the new Ms. would no longer rely on celebrity interviews or profiles. `` It's going to be a hard-hitting, journalistic magazine,'' she said. Industry observers have said they expect Ms. will scale back its circulation base of 550,000 when it resumes publication.

<HEAD>Ford Announces New Incentive Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced a new incentive program that doubles some cash rebates and adds two full-size cars to the list of affected vehicles. The news reflected the increasing problems automakers face because of slow sales and a sluggish economy, which has forced them to sharply curtail production plans. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement came the day after Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> said he hoped the industry would return to the days when vehicles were sold on their merits instead of on cash-back offers and cut-rate financing. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was no conflict between <PERSON> Poling </PERSON>'s comments and the incentive program. Like other automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> provides incentives to dealers in addition to the advertised customer incentives. Dealer incentives may be used at the discretion of the dealer for advertising, marketing or passing along to consumers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s new incentive program includes rebates ranging from $ 500 to $ 4,000, depending on vehicle, and interest rates ranging from 4.8 percent to 10.9 percent, depending on model and length of loan. The program is in effect until Feb. 5. Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced a new incentive program significantly boosting cash rebates. That program expires Jan. 31, but the company guaranteed that if rebates are increased later, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> would make up the difference in the rebate for anyone buying a vehicle between now and the end of next month. For the first time, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> put incentives on its popular minivans. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Wednesday included incentives for the first time on its full-size Ford Crown <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and Mercury Grand Marquis cars. Interest rates on <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s minivan, the Aerostar, were lowered to a range between 4.8 percent and 10.9 percent, depending on the length of the loan.

<HEAD>Judge Puts Off Hearing on Unsealing Court Documents</HEAD>

 A federal judge Wednesday put off a hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s request to keep under seal environmental documents filed in a lawsuit brought by a former executive, who says he was fired for refusing to `` sanitize'' pollution reports. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said he wanted to give <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s attorneys a chance to prepare arguments for their opposition to a request by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to enter the case. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> was to hear arguments Wednesday on whether or not to make the documents public. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, an attorney for the former employee, said he favors unsealing the documents because they are `` directly relevant'' to a public proceeding. An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eittreim </PERSON>, said his arguments were similar to <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>'s. But <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he wanted to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s legal papers, which he received shortly before the hearing. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> set a new date for Friday and told the parties to submit more papers. The former employee, <PERSON> Valcar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, claims he was fired as <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s environmental affairs manager for refusing to `` sanitize'' assessments of environmental problems at company plants nationwide. He claims the company's legal office made changes to downplay pollution problems. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, 47, of <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, worked at the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> offices of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> denies the charge, saying it had a right to fire <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> and did so as part of a legitimate economic cutback. The company also denies altering the reports other than to make a few minor editing and typographical changes. The parties dispute whether <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> should unseal a series of environmental assessment reports submitted in support of arguments made in the pre-trial stages. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> says the whole documents are central to his case. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> says it is willing to release only portions it feels are relevant, and to release the entire reports _ which are self-critical evaluations _ would stifle attempts by companies to be candid about conditions at their plants.

<HEAD>Coleman Announces Deal To Sell Heating and Air Conditioning Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Canadian company has agreed to buy the heating and air conditioning division of the <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Wednesday. A Coleman spokesman said the financial terms of the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> would n't be announced. The transaction is scheduled to be completed in early 1990. Beacon International is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a small holding company. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> officials said the 650 workers in the division likely wo n't notice much change under the new owner. There had been fears a Coleman competitor would buy the division and move it or close it. In addition to a <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> plant with more than 1 million square feet of manufacturing and office space, the division has a smaller factory employing 96 workers in <LOCATION> Nacodoches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and a distribution center in <LOCATION> Tornoto </LOCATION>. Gross division sales in 1988 were $ 124.8 million. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has been trying to sell the division and several other units since Wall Street investor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> acquired the company from the <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> family earlier this year. In November, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Crosman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> unit was sold for $ 41 million to an investor group that included senior managers from the division. A tentative deal for the sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trailers </ORGANIZATION> division is awaiting finalization.

<HEAD>TLC Beatrice Withdraws Planned Stock Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a food company controlled by investor <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, said Tuesday it had scrapped plans to sell a 35 percent stake to the public. The company cited unfavorable stock market conditions for abandoning the plan, which was intended to raise as much as $ 194 million. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the offer might have been poorly timed. `` The time of the year and the market conditions right now were both factors,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Also, my sense is that there is now not much awareness in the institutional investor community about what is going on in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, or our company and how it fit into the picture in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The underwriters of the proposed offering, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, also advised TLC <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> to withdraw the offer, the company said. The offering would have made <ORGANIZATION> TLC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> the first black-controlled company on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It also would have left <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> with 58 percent of the shares. He now has 55 percent. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> created the company by acquiring the international operations of the former <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 985 million in 1987.
