<TEXT>
 A blind attorney who was carried forcibly from a jetliner after a dispute over where she should be seated complains that airlines look at the handicapped `` as if we're a safety risk and have to be treated like baggage.'' The attorney, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>, said Friday she is still angry over an incident Thursday evening aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner waiting to take off from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on a flight to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. After boarding, she said, she sat in a window seat in the second row from the back of the cabin in the smoking section. But she was told to move to the first row in the front of the cabin because she is blind and needed to be closer to a full-door emergency exit. When she refused, arguing that there are no federal safety regulations that require her to sit in a particular seat, police were summoned and carried her off the plane. She was charged with trespassing. `` It was embarrassing,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>, 34, an attorney from <LOCATION> Grinnell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> of the <PERSON> Blind </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` They told the police to carry me off and they did.'' She insisted that she sought no confrontation and wanted only to return to her hometown when the dispute erupted aboard Midway Flight 179 as it prepared to depart for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The flight was delayed about 45 minutes because of the confrontation, according to airport officials. Ironically, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> had flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform committee to discuss problems blind people are having in air travel. She said she was told by a flight attendant that she could not sit at the rear of the aircraft even though her seat did not block access to any emergency exit doors because of the airlines' policy on dealing with handicapped passengers. `` Then the captain came. He said, ` You will do what the flight attendant tells you and sit where you're told or not fly on this airplane.','' she recounted. She refused to budge and airport police were called to carry her off the plane, according to accounts related by airline and airport officials as well as Miss <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- airline officials -RRB- feel that blind people are not the same as other passengers, that we're a safety risk and that we have to be treated like baggage in order to carry us safely,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>. `` That's not federal law. They violated my rights.'' She has been summoned to appear at an arraignment on the trespass charge May 19. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has no requirements on where blind passengers should be seated, although the agency has recomended that they not be seated in a row that has an emergency exit. Miss <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON> said she sat in a row with no such exit. A <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, said that the airline has a firm policy of seating handicapped passengers, including those who are blind, on the front row of the aircraft cabin because those seats are closest to a floor-level emergency door. Responding to the incident involving Miss <PERSON> Pinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said `` she refused to be briefed -LRB- on safety procedures -RRB- and maintained she could sit where she wanted ... We could not take off seated where she was and asked her to step off -LRB- the plane -RRB- because she was inconveniencing 100 passengers.'' Because of her confrontation Thursday night she remained in the capital another day and on Friday accompanied several other officials of the National Federation of the Blind to a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> to discuss alleged discrimination against the handicapped by the airlines, a spokewoman for the federation said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the department, is developing new regulations aimed at giving the airlines closer guidance on how to provide for the handicapped, but those regulations are not expected to be announced for several months.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressman says `` something just does n't smell right'' about a federal banking agency's request for an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check of one of its critics. The request to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official `` smacks of a way of life that seems to be more appropriate to life in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> than it does in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check was revealed by an internal bank board investigation requested by <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> consumer protection subcommittee. The report, by bank board Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, disclosed that the office of <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, bank board enforcement director, asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 17 to check on <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, developer. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> returned the request, which listed only <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s name and address, stamped `` insufficient information,'' and Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> decided not to pursue the matter. Because of <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s criticism, <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> had asked for an investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that manages and sells real estate from bankrupt savings and loans. <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> was under attack from <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>, other business people and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for reported mismanagement and conflicts of interest. <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON> had threatened to bring a class action lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of disgruntled developers who believed they had been poorly treated by the agency. Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> told investigators she was asked in June to obtain the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> check from FADA General Counsel <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Axley </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON> had made verbal threats and written nasty letters to then <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rosyln </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Axley </PERSON> told the investigators that Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> asked him to `` have <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON> checked out'' after she received anonymous telephone calls in the middle of the night to her unlisted home telephone. <PERSON> Axley </PERSON> said he subsequently received a tip that <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON> had ties to organized crime. However, the bank board report said the tip referred to someone with a different first name than <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s. After her request to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was returned, Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said she learned more about the nature of <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s dispute with <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION>, consulted her superiors at the bank board and decided it was not appropriate for her to resubmit the query to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said, `` For the bank board to even contemplate investigating a citizen for complaining raises a lot of questions. ... Something just does n't smell right here.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone messages left at her office Friday afternoon. There was no answer at <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s office <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a bank board spokesman, said the agency acknowledges that the request to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should never have been made. `` Once we were aware of it, we indicated we did n't want that pursued and after that it was not,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>, to her credit, said ` Maybe we're not supposed to be doing that sort of thing.''' The bank board has also acknowledged that a law firm hired by <ORGANIZATION> FADA </ORGANIZATION> engaged a private detective agency to look into <PERSON> Juliano </PERSON>'s finances <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would not consider it proper to investigate a government critic. The bureau's practice, he said, is to ask for more information about the reason a background check is requested and if the explanation is not appropriate it can recommend administrative or disciplinary actions against the person who made the request. <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> has not been reprimanded.

<HEAD>Passover Horseradish Health Hazard Cited By Doctors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Horseradish eaten during traditional Passover dinners can pose a health hazard, says a Jewish doctor whose father collapsed after consuming an olive-sized serving of the bitter herb. Dr. <PERSON> Haya </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said Friday that her father, <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, quickly recovered after he fainted, keeled over and suffered a small seizure during a Seder, or traditional Passover meal, several years ago. She said the incident shows that people prone to high blood pressure, heart or artery disease or stroke might be better off if they let horseradish fumes evaporate by keeping it uncovered for a half hour before the Seder, or use a substitute such as chopped romaine lettuce stalks. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> suffered high blood pressure before the incident, said his daughter, an internist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Passover holiday, which celebrates the Israelites' Exodus from slavery in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, extends from Friday night until sundown April 9. Seders are held on the first two nights. Horseradish is eaten during the ceremonial meal as a `` bitter herb'' symbolizing the bitterness of slavery. A letter warning that horseradish can be dangerous was published Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Association by Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>, a clinical instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said the horseradish-induced sudden loss of blood pressure that caused <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> to faint and collapse could trigger a fatal stroke, heart attack or abnormal heart rhythm in people with heart disease. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> trained together at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They decided to write the letter after <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> spotted a letter about a similar incident published in the same journal in January. In that letter, Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> told how a healthy 63-year-old man collapsed after eating a large mound of wasabi, or green-colored Japanese horseradish, during a meal of sushi. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>'s letter was headlined: `` Horseradish Horrors: Sushi Syncope.'' <PERSON> Syncope </PERSON> means fainting. The follow-up letter by Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> carried the headline `` The Bitter Herbs of Seder: More on Horseradish Horrors.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said horseradish usually is grated. But the night her father collapsed, the family ground it in a food processor, then placed it in an airtight container, preventing vapors from escaping and making the horseradish unusually potent. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said the collapse probably occurred because the horseradish vapors caused a reflexive drop in blood pressure. Coupled with the elder <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s consumption of Passover wine and use of medicine to reduce his high blood pressure, that briefly deprived the brain of enough blood. `` He still eats horseradish,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` My dad is sort of macho.''

<TEXT>
 About 400 people huffed and puffed Friday at the 17th annual Hash Bash, a spring rally for the legalization of marijuana. Police made no arrests and issued no citations during the event on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campus. University officials had issued a permit for the event but emphasized they were not endorsing it. Possession of small amounts of marijuana in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION> is punishable by a $ 5 fine. `` I've been coming to this since I was a little boy,'' said a 29-year-old who called himself Jizmo Noodles and was one of the first to light up. `` My first one was in 1973. It's a means of expression, civil disobedience.'' Noodles, carrying incense and wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a denim vest with a peace sign, described himself as a `` student of life.'' <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gettman </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or <ORGANIZATION> NORML </ORGANIZATION>, told the gathering that pot smokers were tired of being labeled criminals. `` We're here for a lot of different reasons today,'' he said. `` A lot of people think that because this is April Fools' Day, that this is some some kind of a joke. We are serious, very serious.'' <ORGANIZATION> NORML </ORGANIZATION> wants marijuana legalized, with taxes on it used to develop treatment centers for cocaine and heroin users. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Amicone </PERSON>, sophomore history major, said he started smoking marijuana at 16. `` I got a late start,'' he said.

 American corporations that owe taxes to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will be allowed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign tax credit if payments are made to the government of ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. Friday's announcement was aimed at discouraging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses from sending tax payments to the Panamanian government controlled by military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does not recognize. Some large U.S.-based multinational firms recently made quarterly tax payments just in time to give that government a desperately needed infusion of cash. The foreign tax credit is designed to prevent two national governments from taxing the same dollar of income. In general, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not tax income that an American corporation earns in and pays taxes on to a foreign country. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> recommends mandatory inspection of all nuclear power plants for pipe deterioration following findings that nearly one-third of the nation's commercial reactors already have such a problem. The congressional watchdog agency deemed the industry-wide inspections necessary after reviewing actions taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the utilities themselves since a pipe rupture at the <ORGANIZATION> Surry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2 plant in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> killed four workers in late 1986. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., who released the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, declared that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` failure to act aggressively on this matter is astounding. After the Surry accident, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> did develop evidence of widespread pipe deterioration at the Trojan nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and as of Jan. 21 this year the commission had identified a total of 34 plants with at least some pipe damage caused by erosion or corrosion. In defense of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s approach, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, a commission spokesman, said the commission had sent out `` several notices'' to the industry asking them to inspect their own plants and report back. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Taking advantage of an appeals court ruling earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has ordered a resumption of random drug testing of civilian employees in certain critical jobs. `` The directive went out today,'' <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` It orders resumption of the program effective immediately.'' The move had been expected since Tuesday, when a federal appeals court struck down a preliminary injunction that had stopped the drug-testing program a month ago. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said it was staying the injunction granted to employee unions while it considered the legal merits of the case. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is raising its maximum interest rate for federally backed <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> home mortgages by one-half percentage point to 10 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> said it was making the change, which will take effect Sunday, to reflect recent increases in interest rates in financial markets. In the past 12 months, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> rate has been changed seven times, fluctuating between 9.5 percent and 11 percent. The last change was Feb. 1, when the rate was lowered a full percentage point from 10.5 percent to 9.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the national average for 30-year conventional mortgages, those without government guarantees, rose above 10 percent for the first time since late January. The national average rate was 10.05 percent, up from 9.99 percent the previous week. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> has rewritten its contracts covering development of the new Midgetman mobile nuclear missile, canceling almost $ 1 billion worth of work planned by six contractors. The service, in a brief statement, stressed it could not speak for the six contractors involved but estimated the cutbacks could affect the jobs of as many as 2,300 private-sector employees. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> action became inevitable several months ago when <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> decided the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> could not afford to develop and deploy the single-warhead Midgetman within the budget levels set by the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> had recommended <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> kill the program outright, but the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary decided to request $ 200 million in fiscal 1989 to keep the program alive pending a final decision by the next president. <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is warning consumers not to use <PERSON> Nutrien </PERSON> and Vitalite powdered drink mixes because they may be contaminated with salmonella bacteria. Both products are nutritional supplements marketed as powdered drink mixes by Sunrider International of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and marketed nationally through more than 37,000 independent distributors, generally individuals who sell them door-to-door or to friends.

 The leader of the August coup attempt that almost toppled the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> escaped Saturday from his prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the military announced. A statement said former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> fled at about 2:30 a.m. Saturday -LRB- 1:30 p.m. EST Friday -RRB- aboard two rubber boats along with 13 of his guards. Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> ordered a massive search for the 39-year-old <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and alerted subordinate commands nationwide to be on the lookout for him. The charismatic former lieutenant colonel had been detained on the navy ship since his arrest last December in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb. Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, chief military spokesman, said a reserve lieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain a regular commission had aided in the getaway. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said the boats used in the escape had been sent to increase security after the military learned of a plot to free <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> immediately relieved the commander of the vessel, the RPS <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON>, and ordered his arrest, <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said in a radio address. He appealed to the public to provide information to help recapture <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, former chief of security at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered the popular uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> became disillusioned with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' successor, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, accusing her of `` weak and inept'' leadership that fortified the 18-year-old communist insurgency. On Aug. 28, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the presidential palace and seized several media and military installations in the capital before they were driven off by pro-Aquino forces. The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said it was aimed at killing her and her family. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s effort was the most serious of several major plots to unseat Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the former colonel was so popular that he had become the `` dominant figure'' aboard the ship which was supposed to be his prison. `` It is with sadness that the AFP -LRB- Armed Forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> -RRB- makes public the unfortunate escape from custody of ex-Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> from his detention,'' <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said in a statement `` During a normal inspection of the ship, it was discovered that subject detainee together with his guards headed by Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Gerardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojica </PERSON> and 12 enlisted personnel were found missing. `` Initial investigation revealed that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was apparently assisted and joined by his guards led by Lt j.g. <PERSON> Mojica </PERSON> ... It is believed that bribery was a factor that led to the betrayal of their oath and sworn duty.'' <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> had alerted the military to take precautions to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels did not take advantage of the confusion to launch `` terroristic actions.'' The spokesman said troops were being deployed around <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to search for <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said the military received information a week ago that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the ship. He said the military expected outsiders to try to storm the vessel but `` instead it came from the inside.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was security chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> when opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was minister of national defense. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was fired in November 1986 after the government said it thwarted a coup attempt by his followers. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remained in hiding for months after the August coup.

<HEAD>New Evidence That Millions Of Small Comets Hit Earth Each Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two years after an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> physicist nearly ruined his reputation by suggesting that 10 million small, speedy comets hit Earth's atmosphere annually, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scientist has found evidence supporting <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s theory. `` I'm happy, but it's been a long two years,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Friday, adding that he was met with `` total disbelief'' and `` lost a lot of friends'' after proposing that billions of water-bearing comets could have provided enough water to fill the seas during <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s early history. Other scientists said they remained skeptical of the new evidence, which came from telescope observations by <PERSON> Clayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON>, a physicist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory here `` I'm very convinced that what I'm seeing is real,'' said <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON>, who is deputy project scientist for the planned 1989 launch of the Galileo space probe to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. `` These objects would not have been seen inadvertently during other searches. They're small, they're dark and they're moving fast.'' The theory by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a physicist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, is `` one of the decade's most controversial astronomical theories,'' a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> news release said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> proposed the theory after ultraviolet photographs of Earth taken by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft between 1981 and 1986 revealed countless dark spots that appeared to be tiny holes in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere. He theorized that about 10 million comets, essentially 30-foot-diameter fluffy snowballs with a dark coating, plunge into the atmosphere each year, forming holes, then breaking up and vaporizing. <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON> said his observations on the 36-inch Spacewatch Telescope at <ORGANIZATION> Kitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> make him believe that at least a million such comets hit the atmosphere annually at a speed of 22,000 mph. The comets appeared as white streaks on enhanced telescope images, he said. In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said a soon-to-be-published study, in which atmospheric holes were recently observed by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Viking spacecraft, also supports his theory. `` I'm a little skeptical,'' said astronomer <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON> -RRB- may be seeing something, but to leap to 10-meter comets is a fairly large leap of imagination.'' <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> voiced the most common objection to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s theory: If so many icy comets hit Earth's atmosphere, they also should strike the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, creating a lot of water vapor. Yet the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> has very little water vapor. University of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> physicist and planetary scientist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said that until he examines <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON>' findings, `` I'm not going to say this sounds like confirmation of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s comets or not. But it certainly is exciting.'' About a year ago, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> used 1977 data from the Voyager 2 space probe to show that Earth's atmosphere contained an excess of hydrogen atoms released from water vapor. He said the discovery could be consistent with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s theory, but also could be explained if the hydrogen came from 10 million times fewer comets that were smaller, faster and much more active than those postulated by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The less abundant comets would n't provide enough water to fill the oceans, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. `` I really am a bit skeptical'' of <PERSON> Yeates </PERSON>' observations, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>, associate director for planetary sciences at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` If they -LRB- comets -RRB- are as numerous as he's talking about, then some of these should show up when the telescope is in more normal operation, and they have n't,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said only two specialized telescopes in the country, including Spacewatch, are capable of observing the comets.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers were off the streets as Easter weekend began and a jailed opposition leader's wife said her husband was being held hostage in Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s effort to maintain power Also Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said it was sending 1,300 more military personnel to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> residents, bringing to nearly 12,000 the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Opposition leaders said they planned to meet today or Sunday to decide whether to lift a 12-day-old general strike that has shut down most commercial activity in an effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader and heads of its 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Virtually all businesses were closed for Good Friday. The general strike had eased earlier in the week, with groceries and pharmacies reopening, reportedly under government pressure. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, news reports said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials had discussed trying to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power through military intervention, kidnapping or by arranging a coup. The general is under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON>, a top leader of the opposition National Civic Crusade, spent his fifth day in jail Friday. Other Crusade leaders and several journalists arrested with him Monday had all been released by midday Tuesday. `` All legal efforts on his behalf have been useless,'' <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Friday night. `` They have not charged him, but they do n't let him go. `` We consider <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> a political hostage,'' she said of her husband. The Pentagon said many of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel to be dispatched next week are military police, but army helicopter units will be included. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, had about 600 security personnel among its 10,000 troopers before <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> intensified its campaign for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. Over a 10-day period that ended March 24, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> dispatched 670 more security personnel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for the stated purpose of protecting military facilities. Southern Command spokesman Col. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said the latest troop increase was prompted by `` a longstanding look at what has been going on down here.'' He said it was not made in anticipation of an imminent departure of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and any instability that might follow. No evacuation plans have been discussed with the 45,000 Americans living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he added. Limitations on movement for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were decreased Friday to the lowest of four levels for the first time since the crisis began Feb. 26, permitting them to move freely but avoid crowds and demonstrations. Panamanian police patrols replaced soldiers Friday for the first time since a failed March 16 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It was an indication of how the city has quieted for the holiday weekend, after weeks of protest. Banks have been closed since March 3, and Panamanians who had cash appeared to be using it only for essentials. Despite rumors the decision to lift the strike had been made, two Crusade leaders, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, said that was not the case. `` To the contrary, no decision on that will be made until we are able to meet to discuss it,'' said <PERSON> Casco </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of business organizations, has decided to continue the stoppage, <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> ousted civilian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26 after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire the general. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> subsequently froze Panamanian government deposits in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks in an effort to drive out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The shortage of money and a run on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks forced them to shut down.

<TEXT>
 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to seek a nullification of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections, in which it fell short of a clear majority by gaining 30 of the 60 seats. Party leaders accused the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of manipulating the official results of the March 20 balloting, which were announced Friday. The council said the party known by its Spanish acronym <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> won 30 seats, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> 23 and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seven. Arena emerged as the strongest single party, replacing the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, but its failure to win a majority could produce a legislative deadlock during <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s final year in office.

<HEAD>Navy Robots Successful In Locating Mines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says it has succeeded in using underwater robots to locate mines in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> for the first time since mine-sweeping operatons began last year. A spokesman for the Florida-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> used the devices to locate two mines in the so-called <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> channel of the northern gulf, where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine-sweeping operations have been concentrated. He spoke on condition he not be identified. On Monday, the mine sweeper Fearless used its new `` Super Sea Rover,'' as the submersible is known, to locate a mine tethered to a seabed anchor in 90 feet of water, he said. On Wednesday, the Fearless' submersible robot found another mine, this time by following an anchor and cable to where the explosive lay on the bottom, the spokesman said Friday. Both mines, covered with a layer of marine growth indicating they had been in the water a long time, were detonated by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also said Friday that it has found and destroyed 41 mines in the gulf since its sweeping operations began. The updated figure doubles the number of mines previously reported to have been destroyed by the Americans. In late November, after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Korean War-vintage ocean mine sweepers went into action and quickly found 15 mines in the northern gulf, commanders reported the mine threat was `` under control.'' On Friday, when asked about the current situation, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said through its spokesman that `` our mine countermeasure force is well-suited for the requirements at hand.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have refused to say whether they have found evidence of any recent mine-laying activity by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is believed to have planted the explosives. The mines found by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, as well as about 20 found in other areas of the gulf by the French and the British navies, were all of the 1908-model contact-type, which explode when a ship bumps against their detonator spikes. One such mine damaged the 401,283-ton supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> during the first northbound convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers July 21. The <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> incident prompted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and five <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments to send mine sweepers to the gulf. The Soviets and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> also maintain minesweeping vessels in the waterway, where the `` tanker war,'' an offshoot of the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iraq-Iran war, has raged for four years The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said the 41 mines destroyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> are in addition to 14 others that were recovered intact for research purposes.

<HEAD>Magazine Helps Reunite Americans Whose Schools Were Far From Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Overseas Brats, a magazine for Americans who went to high school half a world away from their homeland, is helping them find classmates they have n't seen for years, says its Army brat publisher. `` The difference between stateside graduates and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> brats, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> brats, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> juniors and others is that those in stateside have a hometown to go to for a reunion,'' said publisher and editor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON>. `` But the brats, after they graduate, they leave the military environment and sometimes are lost,'' he said. Military dependents often are seen as pampered kids living off their globe-traveling parents, <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON> said recently. But they endure hardships abroad and often have trouble adjusting to American life, he said. Class reunions help by bringing overseas graduates together, he said. `` These people need someone who understands their predicament,'' said <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON>, 32. At least 1 million people have gone to overseas <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools since the institutions were created in 1946, <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON> said. More than 80,000 students attend overseas schools each year and more than 5,000 graduate. `` We're not going to find everybody through the magazine, but at least this is one way of finding some of them,'' said <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON>, whose father was an Army colonel. <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON>, a 1973 graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said many military dependents are unable to have 10-year high school reunions like graduates of stateside schools because their classes usually are so small. Some can not return to their alma maters because it would be too expensive. Because of the difficulty in organizing reunions, many students who attended a particular overseas school get together, even if they graduated in different years. `` These reunions create incredible bonds,'' <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON> said. `` When you put these people together I'm not surprised to see strangers talking like old friends.'' <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON>, who founded his quarterly magazine in 1986, boasts 1,000 subscribers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 12 countries. During the day he works for a floor products company, but spends evenings and weekends answering correspondence or writing stories for Overseas Brats. His byline appears on most stories, but there are a few subscribers who offer articles reminiscing about growing up overseas. The 12-page tabloid also carries announcements about upcoming reunions and personal advertisements that resemble lost-and-found ads. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a 1976 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dewey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, organized a reunion in 1986 before the magazine was founded. She says the magazine has made finding friends much easier today. `` Overseas Brats has been a big help,'' said the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, woman. `` It's interesting reading other people's experiences, and it has made me realize that we are a unique group, sort of a loose fraternity It has helped us unite.'' <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON> also has helped organize reunions. In 1982, only six overseas schools held reunions, but 30 three-day reunions are planned this summer throughout the country, <PERSON> Condrill </PERSON> said. `` This takes them back to a happier time, to a more innocent time in their lives,'' he said. `` At these things they are not talking about kids, about taxes. They feel much younger than they are and they're talking with people who were in the same predicament as they were.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is borrowing a few pages from the populist playbooks of rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and ex-rival <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as the presidential candidates try to drum up delegates in next week's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary With <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> neck-and-neck in the delegate count thus far _ <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 653.55 to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 643.55 _ another 81 delegates are at stake in Tuesday's primary in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Both candidates also planned weekend forays into <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses Monday that begin the selection process for 45 of the state's 51 Democratic delegates and its 36 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the national conventions. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor on Friday stepped up his quest for blue-collar votes in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> by sounding the themes of economic populism that had been articulated by <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> until the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman exited the race last month. `` The human cost of seven years of Republican indifference is staggering,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a television ad that started airing Friday. `` Who in this administration could look right into the eyes of the laid-off factory worker or the homeless family and say they've kept the promise of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? I say they've broken that promise.'' The new emphasis was evident in his speeches as well. `` Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams are n't the model for a new <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd of about 500 people crowded into the <ORGANIZATION> Racine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, interviewed on the syndicated show `` One on One,'' said he did n't mind seeing his ideas circulate among those left in the race he'd once hoped to finish first. `` Everybody has stolen it,'' he said. `` I willed it to everybody when I pulled out and I hope they will use it. It is the issue of this campaign.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who sounds the populist message as well, on Friday called for higher prices for farm products and said consumers easily could pick up the tab. `` The fact is farmers deserve fair prices and workers deserve fair wages and the rich must pay fair taxes,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a gathering at the farm of Bud and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` The reality is if urban people are working, they can pay a few more pennies for a glass of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for a loaf of bread.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, speaking later Friday in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION>, invited disgruntled Republicans to vote for him in Tuesday's primary. For people who made the `` colossal error'' of voting for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now `` realize your mistake, you can correct your error,'' he said. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law allows voters to select a candidate from any party regardless of their political affiliation. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, lagging behind in the Democratic race, continued to be the main voice of criticism against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose popularity has surged in recent contests. `` An end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game for criticism and some are immune,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. Bringing up the rear was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who aimed his fire at <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, visiting about 100 supporters at an airport rally in <LOCATION> Eau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of making bold promises to farmers and added: `` If you're looking for a candidate with all kinds of easy promises, I'm not your candidate. I voted against the 1985 farm program that caused a drop in milk prices. We have to do better and I wo n't make promises, unlike some people.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> favors government price supports for dairy farms and is proposing a two-tier support formula that he said would help family farms compete against corporate farms. On the Republican side, 47 delegates were at stake in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the commanding leader over token competitor <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was spending the weekend in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, which holds caucuses Monday, trying to drum up some support Western-style. His schedule included talks to an estimated 5,000 people in Denver-area congregations on Easter Sunday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has conceded he has virtually no chance of being the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, but wants to help influence the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform at the convention. `` He wants to represent conservatives and Christians in the formation of the platform so that we can have a voice,'' said aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>.

 Four youths linked to a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> youth gang were defiant and almost boastful as they admitted raping a 13-year-old girl and stealing a dollar from her, police said. The gang members also were accused of robbing a 17-year-old of his watch and wallet Thursday night, then looking for a girl to rape, Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Friday. `` Last evening they said the sole purpose of them getting together was simply to commit a sexual assault,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Glensor </PERSON>, who interviewed three of the four youths arrested. Police said the youths were defiant and almost boastful as they talked. The youths stole a car Tuesday, decorated it with graffiti, then plotted Thursday's night of crime, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. The girl told investigators she was riding her bicycle with her brother and a friend when a car carrying the youths drove by. The strangers threw concrete blocks at her and her two companions, who ran in different directions, she said. The four youths threatened her with an ax handle and force her into the car. She said she was driven to a remote area, raped by all four, robbed of her dollar bill, then dropped off back in town, where she telephoned police. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, 19, were arrested Thursday night for investigation of kidnapping, sexual assault, sexual assault of a victim under the age of 14, robbery and possession of stolen property. They were held under $ 122,500 bail each. If convicted they could face life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Banks came from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area where the `` Crips'' gang is based, <PERSON> Glensor </PERSON> said. The juveniles, who were not identified, were held in a detention center, and have been charged with the same crimes under juvenile statutes, <PERSON> Glensor </PERSON> said. One, a 16-year-old who has lived in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> about eight months, told police he was a former member of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Crips gang that was a satanic cult, <PERSON> Glensor </PERSON> said. The other is a 13-year-old apparently recruited from the Reno area. The youths wore all-blue Crips-type clothing, from their bandanas, to jeans, jackets and T-shirts, police said. Pictures of the suspects and other alleged gang members were confiscated from the arrested youths. The pictures showed gang members holding sawed-off shotguns and painting Crips graffiti on walls. Scores of black <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area youth gangs are broadly affiliated under the Crips banner, and are sometimes opposed to another loose confederation known as the `` Bloods.'' Authorities have become particularly concerned in recent years as gang turf wars over drug dealing have intensified. There have been reports from around the West of Crips members trying to set up drug rings.

<HEAD>Gandhi Urged To Declare Emergency; 14 More Slain As Security

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> called on Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to impose a state of emergency in their northern state to quell violence by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> separatists that has killed more than 100 people this week. Late Friday and early today, Sikh extremists killed 14 more people in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state as police stepped up security on <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s orders, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The prime minister also called the federally appointed <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> governor, <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> today for urgent consultations on the violence. In addition, police and paramilitary troops began stepping up security on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>' border with the state, where police say smugglers have been moving large quantities of new weapons to the Sikh extremists, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. The latest killings raised to 111 the number of people who have died in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since Sunday in attacks blamed on militant Sikhs who have since 1982 been waging a guerrilla war for a separate homeland. So far this year, more than 635 people have died in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, including Hindus and moderate Sikhs. Sikh militants say they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Hindu majority. Right-wing Hindu groups called for a general strike in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> District today to protest the killings. Residents of the Sikh holy city of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> said about half of the city's shops were shuttered today, but government offices and schools remained open and transportion was normal. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> leaders of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called Friday for the state of emergency. They included <PERSON> Bhagwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dass </PERSON>, vice president of the state <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s governing committee, two of the state party's general secretaries and a former president. The federal government last month was empowered by Parliament to impose an emergency in a single state to combat `` internal disturbances.'' Under an emergency, the government would have the authority to detain people without warrants, suspend press freedom and take other steps against the militants. Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 800 million but are in a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said that eight Sikhs, four Hindus and two unidentified people were killed overnight in three districts of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> by suspected Sikh gunmen. Thirty-seven people were reported killed Thursday night and Friday in the state, the worst one-day toll since March 4, when 45 people were reported slain in a single day, 34 of them at a festival marking the Indian holiday of Holi.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has recommended kidnapping Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and a CIA-coordinated military coup as ways of unseating the general, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, also suggested landing more than 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to encourage Panamanian military officers opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. The proposals were strongly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who labeled them dangerous and ill-timed, said the Times, quoting unidentified administration officials on both sides of the discussion. However, actions still being considered by the Cabinet include fomenting a coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and landing more than 3,000 soldiers at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a show of force, the Times said. A group of Panamanian officers attempted a coup last month, but failed. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, traveling with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, would not comment on the report. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> suggested sending a special operations team to kidnap <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial on drug trafficking charges, the newspaper said. A kidnapping was ruled out after opponents argued that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' image would be blackened if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> were accidentally killed during such an attempt, the Times said. They also warned <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> of the repercussions of arresting a foreign leader in his own country to face criminal charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also proposed taking unspecified military action inside <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in response to a request from deposed civilian President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last month after he attempted to fire the general. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that it was sending about 1,300 additional military personnel to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to improve security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> civilians living there. The move fell far short of the steps advocated by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who urged the use of force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after aides concluded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic pressure on the troubled Central American country was faltering, the Times said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has about 10,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to protect the strategic <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. An additional 17,000 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> citizens live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Pressure against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime has been mounting since he was named in a federal indictment alleging he helped drug traffickers move cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have also alleged that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was dealing with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> while was ostensibly cooperating with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug and intelligence agencies. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration precipitated an economic crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last month by cutting off the supply of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars to Panamanian banks. But the maneuver appeared to weaken this week after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> broke a general strike, seized flour mills and reopened <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ports.

Even the <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>'s address, 79 <ORGANIZATION> Wistful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION>, became a place on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cultural roadmap. Each Tuesday night, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> welcomed to his home such unforgettable characters as <ORGANIZATION> Wallace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wimple </ORGANIZATION>, The Old Timer, Beulah the Maid and Myrt, <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>'s omnipresent telephone operator. `` Even though he had become very frail, his mind and his humor were as fresh as ever. We all adored him,'' said <PERSON> Lenore </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingston </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had served as chairman of the radio veterans' group. Like the couple in the `` <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>'' scripts, the show's stars were married. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> came to radio out of vaudeville to formulate with writer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> the quintessential situation comedy. `` We do n't like _ I mean, people do n't like _ humor that suggests anything repulsive,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said in an interview during the show's height. Anatomy gags, jibes about marriage and mothers-in-law were kept out. `` It is typically American humor, neither the Broadway type nor <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> influenced,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Keavy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> wrote in 1940. `` They get their humor from simple things like fixing the brakes or playing checkers. They never just tell jokes. They never step out of character.'' The situations in the show turned on such simple items as Fibber deciding, against <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>'s advice, to tune the piano. His bumbling effort was invariably interrupted by the `` bong-bong'' of the door chimes. The <ORGANIZATION> McGees </ORGANIZATION>' neighbors were a classic set of American humor characters. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> played the rumbling, pompous <PERSON> Throckmorton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildersleeve </PERSON>; <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Arquette </PERSON> was the cantankerous Old-Timer; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was henpecked <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimple </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, later a regular on `` The Lucy Show,'' was Mayor La Trivia. After the show ended in 1957, a television version was attempted in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 1959-1960 season. Of the original cast, only <PERSON> Peary </PERSON> remained and he played Mayor La Trivia, not <PERSON> Gildersleeve </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, met <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON> at choir practice when both were in their teens. They married in 1918. The couple began appearing on radio in 1925, but still worked vaudeville because the new medium paid so little. In 10 years of trial-and-error work, they created <PERSON> Fibber </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> died of cancer in 1961. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> married <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> the following year. She survives him. Other survivors include a son, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, from his marriage to <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, as well as several grandchildren.

<TEXT>
 Police combed a neighborhood today for a carload of gang members who fired on pedestrians as they drove by, killing one and wounding 12 others, including a 4-year-old boy, authorities said. The gunmen indiscriminately shot at people standing on a sidewalk Friday night in a gang-ridden area of south <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON>. No motive was given for the shootings. `` ` It's a little too early,'' said a policeman who declined to give his name. `` The officers are still out there hustling up whatever they can find.'' Extra officers were dispatched to help look for three men in a brown Cadillac, <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON> said. Thirteen people were hit by gunfire, said police Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, but only 11 could be accounted for at hospitals. Authorities said two of the wounded may have sought medical attention on their own. A 19-year-old man shot in the right side was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Adelaida </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Certa </PERSON>. None of the victims' names were immediately available. The 4-year-old boy was in serious but stable condition with wounds in the side, arm and legs, Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Certa </PERSON> said. A 29-year-old man with leg and hand wounds and a 20-year-old man with a leg wound were in fair condition, she said. A man was in critical condition at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan with gunshot wounds to the stomach and legs, said a nursing supervisor who refused to be identified. Another man was treated and released. Two men with leg wounds were in fair condition at <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciraulo </PERSON>. A 29-year-old man was taken to <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with minor injuries, but it was uncertain whether he would be admitted, said a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name. A 16-year-old and another teen-age boy were treated at other hospitals and released, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Breezy weather early today forced organizers to scratch their attempt at a world-record human-powered flight across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> by a cyclist-pilot in a flying machine called the Daedalus. Windless weather is important for the 74-mile flight to the island of <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> and winds of nearly six miles an hour grounded the silver-and-pink aircraft on a military runway at the last moment. `` It's disappointing, but the wind seems to be a little too strong,'' pilot <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, 26, a professional cyclist from <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, told reporters. The last-minute postponement illustrated just how unpredictable the weather can be on this southern Greek island. Gusting winds and rain squalls delayed the first scheduled flight of the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> 88 on Wednesday. After nine days of blustery weather, conditions Thursday were good enough to allow the five athlete pilots to take turns test-flying the plane at speeds of around 14 miles per hour and about 15 feet above the tarmac of the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> air force base. A successful touchdown on <LOCATION> Santorini </LOCATION> -LRB- Thira -RRB- would more than triple the exisiting record of 22.5 miles for straight-line human-powered flight, set by <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> piloting the Gossamer Albatross across the English channel in 1979. Built of high-tech composite materials _ graphite epoxy, kevlar plastic fiber and mylar polystyrene film _ the <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> plane has a huge 112-foot wingspan and resembles an outsized insect in flight. The flight in a fragile pedal-powered plane is aimed at emulating <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION>, the legendary craftsman who flapped his way across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> on wings of wax and feathers, according to a 3,500-year-old Greek myth. According to the myth, <ORGANIZATION> Daedalus </ORGANIZATION> made it safely across the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> but his son <PERSON> Icarus </PERSON> flew too close to the sun and plummeted to his death as his wings melted.

 A man working at an archaeological dig attacked co-workers, stabbing two women to death and injuring a pregnant woman and her husband, police said. The suspect, identified as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> and believed to be 40 to 45 years old, remained at large today, police said. Authorities said they had no motive for the stabbings Friday. Police temporarily shut down a nearby expressway and searched a wooded area in this <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb after the man fled in a pickup truck registered to one of the victims. The four graduate students were `` stabbed with a knife or other sharp instrument,'' while working in a house where artifacts are tested, police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He refused to say whether a weapon was recovered. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, 39, was stabbed several times. He ran from the house to a neighbor's house, then to a construction site where the archaeological dig was under way, according to witnesses. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with stab wounds of the legs, arms and abdomen. He was in stable condition, hospital officials said. His wife, 31-year-old <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, was taken to <LOCATION> Hahnemann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where she was treated for multiple stab wounds to the back and internal injuries.

The couple were working on their doctorates in anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, college spokeswoman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFarge </PERSON> said. The two slain women, also graduate students in anthropology and archaeology, died of multiple stab wounds, <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner Dr. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> identified them as <PERSON> Clarice </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorner </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Annaliese </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Killoran </PERSON>, 22, of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.

 The young officer who led an August coup attempt that nearly felled President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government fled a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> early today aided by his elite navy guards Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> cut short a private Easter holiday in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> and rushed to the capital for an emergency Cabinet meeting after hearing of the escape of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. She told a national television audience <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was to have been court-martialed for leading the bloody Aug. 28 coup attempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> warned military personnel that those who assist or harbor <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> `` will be dealt with promptly and severely with the full force of the law.'' The charismatic soldier escaped at about 2:30 a.m. aboard two rubber boats along with 14 guards from the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Warfare Unit who were guarding him, Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON>, chief military spokesman, told reporters. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said the roughly half dozen remaining guards fired on the boats as they slipped away in the darkness, but apparently missed. The prison ship, the <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON>, was anchored 500 yards from the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>'s main wharf, he said. Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> ordered a nationwide search for the 39-year-old <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who had been on the ship since his December arrest in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb. Armored personnel carriers and bulldozers blocked entrances to military camps in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and checkpoints were set up on major highways. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said a reserve lieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain a regular commission had aided in the escape. `` It is believed that bribery was a factor,'' the spokesman added, saying the lieutenant and 13 enlisted personnel had apparently assisted and joined in the escape. He said the boats used to flee had been sent to increase security after the military learned of a plot to free <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> warned that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> may try to organize a new bid to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. He said the government expected <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> to resume anti-Aquino propaganda efforts and again try to divide the military. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> fled to avoid prosecution for mutiny and sedition, arson, murder and conduct unbecoming an officer. She said his escape `` is tantamount to an admission of his guilt.'' She also said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> staged his coup attempt to evade investigation of alleged misapproriation of $ 100,000 worth of military equipment and to avoid a combat assignment against communist rebels. `` I appeal to all citizens and leaders, public and private, to assist us in the recapture of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> as soon as possible,'' she said. Presidential guards stepped up security around the presidential palace immediately after word of the escape. Civilians were barred from the palace compound. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the military was `` taking every possible action'' to bring back <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and `` minimize or neutralize any further damage that he can make.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> chief of security, played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986 mutiny that with a popular uprising toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But he became disillusioned with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, accusing her of `` weak and inept'' leadership that fortified the 19-year-old communist insurgency. On Aug. 28, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led a force of 2,000 men who attacked the presidential palace and seized several media and military installations in the capital before they were driven off by pro-Aquino forces. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the attack it was aimed at killing her and her family. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s was the most serious of several major plots to unseat Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. The military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men involved in the coup attempt are still at large. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> is widely regarded within the 160,000-member armed forces as a courageous, experienced officer. Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he is so popular he had become the `` dominant figure'' aboard the ship that was supposed to be his prison. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said the military received information a week ago that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard the ship, expecting outsiders to try to storm the vessel. `` Instead, it came from the inside.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> security chief when opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was minister of national defense. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was fired in November 1986 after the government said it thwarted a coup attempt by his followers. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> remained in hiding for months after the August coup. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said weeks before the arrest that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was being protected by undisclosed civilian and military figures.

 A disc jockey who told a white lie about the weather found his listeners ready for an April Fools' Day snow job. WKIR-FM radio personality <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> told a whopper about the weather that was swallowed hook, line and sinker by some listeners. His phony forecast _ freezing rain and snow _ in a state where the merest hint of winter weather sends residents scurrying to the grocery put a damper on at least one businessman's day. `` They said the rain was supposed to turn to sleet and snow, and the temperature tonight and tomorrow was going to be in the 20s,'' said barber <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who said trade was slow following <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>'s bogus prediction of icy streets `` I'm not going to listen to that station any more,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> was bombarded with anxious calls about road conditions. Troopers were stymied, however, when they turned to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for help. `` The weather service called us wanting to know where we got our information,'' station spokeswoman <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` Then the Highway Patrol called wanting to talk to the station manager. Then, the Civil Defense called wanting to talk to the station manager.'' <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> went on air to apologize, and told listeners he'd lost his job. April Fool! `` He's still kidding around,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` The phone has n't stopped ringing -LRB- with listeners concerned for <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> -RRB- since I got in,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, the disc jockey who follows <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON>.

 A disc jockey's on-air account of an unidentified flying object causing commotion in a park was so convincing that some people claimed they witnessed the mysterious rumble and flash of light. `` People are seeing it. But it ai n't there,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Honsberger </PERSON>, news director for KDKA-AM, the station that broadcast the April Fools' Day joke. `` We just had a lady call who said she saw a bunch of gray trucks go in led by a jeep. These people are claiming to have seen that thing. But we started it all,'' <PERSON> Honsberger </PERSON> said, chuckling. Not everyone was laughing. Worried listeners flooded the switchboard at the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police station in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolverton </PERSON> repeatedly assured callers there was nothing going on and that the radio report had been a hoax. `` They were pretty much upset with the fact that a radio station would be allowed to get away it,'' <PERSON> Wolverton </PERSON> said. `` A lot of them were critical because they picked Good Friday. Good Friday seemed to be more important than April Fools' Day.'' Morning disc jockey <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cigna </PERSON> startled his listeners with the report and offered no explanation or elaboration when he ended his four-hour broadcast at 9 a.m. But his replacement, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkes </PERSON>, informed listeners it had been a joke. `` Remember everyone, today is April Fools' Day,'' <PERSON> Hawkes </PERSON> said. None of the morning news reports included the so-called emergency, <PERSON> Honsberger </PERSON> noted. `` That should be a clue to anybody,'' he said. `` If anything was happening, it would be our lead story.

 Tornadoes touched down in five east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> towns, destroying two mobiles homes, damaging dozens of houses and overturning cars, authorities said. One minor injury was reported. In East Mountain, near <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, a tornado damaged 25 homes Friday, blowing seven or eight of them off their foundations, witnesses said. `` I was on top of the mountain watching for tails out of the clouds when the rain began falling so hard you could n't even see,'' said East Mountain Assistant City Marshal <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Luchau </PERSON>. `` We knew the storm was getting worse, but it happened so quick, there was n't time to warn anyone. A tornado also destroyed two mobile homes and damaged three homes in nearby Glenwood Acres, officials said, but it was unclear whether it was the same tornado that struck East Mountain. The city hall, an elementary school and a car dealership suffered heavy damage at <LOCATION> Gladewater </LOCATION>, about 20 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>.

The pope has frequently spoken in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have cited the Palestinian question, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unsettled boundaries and the status of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as reasons for the absence of ties The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> either. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON>, brought to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> today an entourage of 31 people, including his wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic.

 Israeli troops opened fire today on Palestinians who attacked them with rocks, bottles, knives and metal bars in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and four protesters were killed, the army said. Two Israeli soldiers were injured. There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded protesters. The army said two protesters were wounded by gunfire, but <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists set the number as high as 13. The bloodshed broke out as Jews celebrated the first day of Passover, the weeklong festival celebrating the exodus of the Jews from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and a day after Christians marked Good Friday. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, protesters hurled knives and metal rods at patrolling troops and tried to seize their weapons, an army spokesman said. Soldiers opened fire on the attackers, killing three, he said. One soldier suffered stab wounds and was taken to a nearby hospital, the army spokesman said. His condition was not described as serious. Another soldier was slightly injured, the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with army regulations. Officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> hospitals said they admitted three Palestinians with gunshot wounds, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said another was transferred to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hospital. Palestinian reporters identified the dead men as <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> al Kourdy, 55, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourdy </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourdy </PERSON>, 21. In the biblical <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, troops fired at hundreds of protesters who attacked them with rocks and empty bottles in the town's main market, and one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was killed, the army said. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said the violence began in the morning after soldiers forced shops in the main market to close in violation of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> orders that they stay open in the morning but observe a strike in the afternoon. Protest leaders then arrived and forced shops to reopen, the witnesses said. Hundreds of youths gathered and began moving through the market streets to central <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where troops were stationed. As the protesters hurled rocks and empty bottles at the troops, some soldiers turned and began chasing the youths through the winding, cobblestoned streets, firing tear gas, rubber bullets and finally live bullets, the witnesses said. They said several demonstrators were wounded. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallas </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON>, 23, was dead on arrival at nearby Bet Jalla hospital from a gunshot wound to the head, according to doctors there and the ambulance driver, who would only give his name as <PERSON> Issa </PERSON>. An army spokesman confirmed the death but said troops only fired at the man when he approached them with an object that resembled a firebomb. During a hastily organized funeral march for <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON> along a main road in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, troops fired tear gas and live bullets at mourners, said a witness who would only give his name as <PERSON> Halman </PERSON>. There were no immediate reports of injuries. On the street where <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON> was shot, the branch of an olive tree was put in a puddle of blood, beside a sign that read: `` The heroic martyr, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, the killings brought the Palestinian death toll to 131 since unrest broke out Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. One Israeli soldier has died. With fewer Holy Week visitors than usual because of the Arab uprising in its occupied lands, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sought to ensure the safety of thousands of Christians who had come for Easter Sunday observances. The violence came on the day before Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was scheduled to arrive for talks in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as he pushes a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today and received Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s blessing on the eve of his peace mission. The pontiff stressed any accord must respect the `` legitimate rights'' of both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Palestinians. Police and troops were reinforced in and around <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s holy sites to protect participants at Easter ceremonies by Christians celebrating their belief that <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was resurrected two days after dying on a cross. Disturbances took an early toll on the holiday weekend Friday, as Israeli troops killed two Arabs and wounded at least 13.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said today that its forces have overrun Kurdish guerrilla bases in the mountainous northeast in an offensive aimed at crushing Iranian-backed rebels who threaten vital oilfields. Kurdish guerrilla leaders have claimed the Iraqis, backed by tanks and air strikes, were dropping poison gas bombs on villages in what one commander called `` a war of genocide.'' <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a military communique as saying its troops `` completely purged'' the area around <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION> region, 50 miles west of the <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> oilfields. <PERSON> Qara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagh </PERSON> is only 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where Iranian Revolutionary Guards have thrust into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in a 16-day-old offensive. `` All traitors have finally been destroyed,'' the communique declared in a reference to the Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels who have been fighting <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for an independent homeland for years. There was no independent confirmation. <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that heavy fighting was raging in the region Friday but that he had no reports of an Iraqi breakthrough. <PERSON> Massud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement several days ago, that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army had launched a major offensive against the guerrillas March 23. He said two divisions of troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air strikes, were seeking to dislodge Kurdish fighters from the <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> mountains between <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> and the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sulaimaniyeh </LOCATION>. An Iraqi division usually numbers about 12,000 men. <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> said the Iraqi assaults had been beaten back. He claimed Iraqi warplanes were dropping chemical bombs on Kurdish strongholds and villages suspected of harboring guerrillas. The villages were north of the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> bridgehead around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi chemical bombing attacks March 16-17 killed 5,000 civilians and injured as many more. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> said the Iraqis had seized some villages. He also charged the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force was dropping gas bombs on Kurdish settlements. `` It's a war of genocide against the Kurdish people,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` They use chemical weapons against us all the time and raze our villages.'' Today's communique said an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> force, including Kurdish fighters loyal to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, had overrun 21 Kurdish bases and villages used by the guerrillas in the last few days. It gave no casualty figure. The Kurdish guerrillas have in the last 18 months created a second front in the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war The Iraqis have had to divert tens of thousands of troops badly needed in the main battle zones in the south to contain the insurgency in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. The Kurds claimed to control 4,000 square miles in the northeast. About 20 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the borders of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> meet.

<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Marxist government imposed huge price inceases on food, and a government newspaper said Saturday that the increases were necessitated by a guerrilla war that has ravaged the economy. Prices for rice, sugar, corn, cooking oil, bread and soap all rose sharply under government-mandated increases that took effect Friday in the southern African nation. In a bid to offset the higher food prices, the government also granted wage increases to some workers. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> went from 9 cents to 60 cents per kilogram, about 2.2 pounds. Corn flour rose from nine cents to 32 cents per kilogram and a kilogram of sugar went from 11 cents to 59 cents. The minimum wage for an industrial worker has been raised from about $ 17 a month to $ 29 per month. However, raises were not granted to workers in factories that were losing money. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> also has a high unemployment rate and thousands of refugees displaced by a war raging since the 1960s. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 after years of fighting. Since then guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> have been battling to oust the Marxist government. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>, in an editorial Saturday, blamed the country's economic woes on `` the continued and systematic aggression against <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, carried out by the racist regimes of the region _ first <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> and later <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In the mid-1970s, then white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> helped backed the anti-Marxist guerrillas. After <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> became black-ruled <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> in 1980, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> began supplying the rebels. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> signed a mutual non-aggression pact in 1984, but both sides regularly accuse the other of violations. <PERSON> Noticias </PERSON> said foreign support of the rebels has destabilized <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and `` has prevented us from consolidating our independence and developing our economy.'' `` <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, devastated by more than 20 consecutive years of war, is currently one of the poorest countries in the world,'' Noticias said. `` The state can no longer go on paying food subsidies.'' An estimated 5 million of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people are in need of food aid. In other developments, government troops killed 38 rebel fighters in clashes during the past week in three separate provinces, the national news agency AIM said. The rebels were killed in clashes from March 29-31 in the central provinces of <LOCATION> Sofala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambazia </LOCATION> and the northwestern province of Tete, AIM said, citing a report on Radio <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The report made no mention of government troop casualties.

 Soviet officials negotiating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on halving nuclear arsenals no longer believe they will have an agreement to sign by the time President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visits next month, well-placed Soviet sources say. The ruling Politburo officially remains determined `` to work intensively for the speediest drafting of a set of documents'' to have them ready for signing at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. But Soviet officials said privately they do not sense a similar urgency on the American side. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to meet Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> May 29 to June 2 at the fourth U.S.-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power three years ago. One source familiar with the negotiations said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has not responded directly to four specific proposals <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put forward at his last meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in February. `` They do n't appear to be in a position to make decisions at this point,'' the analyst said of the American negotiators. Speaking on condition he not be identified, the source said there are `` major, substantive issues'' outstanding on how to cut both sides' strategic arsenals by 50 percent even before consideration of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Star Wars'' program for a space-based shield against nuclear attack. Disputes over that program have blocked agreement in the past. The concept of a 50 percent cut has been accepted by both sides, but the issue is complicated by the differing numbers and types of weapons in each side's arsenals. The source said the two sides remain far apart on how to reduce mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, which make up an important element of the Soviet arsenal, and on cuts in sea-launched cruise missiles. Chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> acknowledged differences in those areas as well as others in testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week. A Western diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing for a ban on mobile ICBMs such as the Soviet SS-25 because it would be too difficult if not impossible to verify the number of such weapons remaining in the Soviet arsenal after an agreed-upon number had been destroyed. The Soviets, the diplomat said, are pressing to include sea-launched cruise missiles in any agreement, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators contend they should be left out because no acceptable verifications measures exist to ensure compliance. A Soviet source said, and the diplomat confirmed, that the Soviets have proposed a joint project to test a verification procedure using airborne electronic sensors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have expressed doubts such sensors could tell one nuclear weapon from another or from a ship's nuclear reactor. `` We proposed a way to verify sea-launched weapons,'' a Soviet official said. `` They told us they did n't think it would work. But they have n't come up with any other plan.'' Another Soviet analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus said he suspects the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side has concluded the Soviets are so anxious for an agreement that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration can gain more concessions by holding out longer. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still trying to conclude an agreement before the summit. But he, too, was skeptical. `` Achievement of a treaty in that time frame is possible, but it will be difficult given the number and complexity of issues which remain unresolved,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said.

 Bombs planted by the Afghan intelligence agency, created and run by the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, have killed more than 400 civilians in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has balked at signing a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations-brokered </ORGANIZATION> deal calling for an end to covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan guerrillas at the same time that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stops aiding the the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` The bombings definitely have people worried. They are designed to get <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to sign the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. But the government has stuck to its position,'' said a Pakistani official. He, like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources interviewed about the bombings, spoke on condition of anonymity. The Afghan Ministry for State Security, or WAD, `` is a mirror image of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>,'' combining domestic and foreign intelligence activities with military functions, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analyst. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report issued last year said WAD had 20,000 agents, although some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials put the number at 30,000. WAD has its own uniformed military units and assigns officers to regular military units to bolster discipline, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. WAD has 1,500 advisers from the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, which has run it since since shortly after the coup that brought Marxists to power in April 1978, the sources said. The most recent terrorist episode was last Thursday, when a bomb exploded in a poultry shop near the Afghan border, killing seven people and injuring 18. The bloodiest incident was last July 14, when three car bombs exploded at the main bazaar of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, the largest city in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, killing 72 and injuring 260. WAD staged about a dozen bombings inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in 1985, 20 in 1986, and more than 100 in 1987, said a second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analyst. `` They are continuing at about the same rate this year.'' Among recent bombings attributed to WAD: _ Feb 22, one person was killed and two others were hurt by a bomb in a popular hotel in <LOCATION> Bajaur </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. _ Feb 23, a boy was killed by a bomb in his home in <LOCATION> Bajaur </LOCATION>. The same day, another bomb destroyed a shop owned by an Afghan refugee in the city. _ Feb 27, five people were killed and 11 injured by a bomb in a motorcycle in a in the main bazaar in <LOCATION> Thal </LOCATION>, a refugee center in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. _ March 1, two people were killed and two others were injured when a bomb exploded in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, a city in northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> crowded with Afghan refugees _ March 18, a letterbox exploded at a bus station, in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION>, setting fire to an empty bus _ March 25, nine people were injured, one critically, by a bomb at a bus stand in <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> Diplomats at the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> declined to comment on WAD or any other subject. The bombings started in 1985, about when <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became General Secretary of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the current <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader, known by the single name of <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, left the Afghan intelligence agency to become secretary in the ruling party, say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani sources. <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, trained as a physician in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, became party leader in 1986 and head of state last year. Col. <PERSON> Geb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Farouq </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqubi </PERSON> now runs WAD, which until last year was known as the Committee for State Security, or KHAD. `` Clearly, sometime in 1985, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> decided it had to increase pressure on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, and began cross-border air raids'' in Afghan warplanes piloted by Soviets and Afghans, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government source. But the air raids `` backfired,'' said the source. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came very close to selling <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> high-technology Airborne Warning and Control -LRB- AWACs -RRB- planes to track the intruders, a sale that was opposed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, a friend of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and an enemy of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Instead, WAD `` stepped up the terror bombing, and there has n't been so much of a reaction,'' said the source The initial bombings were aimed at the 3 million Afghan refugees who live just inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, crossing the border to wage their guerrilla war against the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops backing the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. The campaign became more serious, said a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> official, when the bombs began to explode in major cities like <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, far from the refugees, deep in the heart of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Afghan intelligence, under Soviet tutelage, recruits agents to plant the bombs, which analysts describe as `` crude,'' and consisting in part of Soviet-made components. `` We have arrested a lot of these guys, and they say they are paid by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government,'' said the Pakistani official. `` They include Pakistanis and Afghans,'' who are drawn from the same ethnic groups and cross the border easily, he said. For each bombing, they are paid several hundred dollars, `` a huge amount of money'' in such an impoverished area, said the official. `` For killing, they get more.''

<TEXT>
 In the best of times, which these are not, life was no cinch in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. But a general strike aimed at overthrowing the regime of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> closed <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s banks and much of its business and sent the poor suburb's unemployment even higher. The few who have jobs often ca n't cash their checks to buy food because of government-ordered banks closures and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial sanctions. Better-off Panamanians had cash at home or were able to withdraw some before the banks closed, and by buying only essentials they are managing to get by. But in the hillside shacks of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>, that option did n't exist Hunger spread so rapidly that the parish churches, which were distributing food, have had to pass the job to <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION>, a Roman Catholic relief organization, and content themselves with trying to catalogue the soaring need. `` They are giving out 3,500 meals a day in my parish,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karamanites </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> parish in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. Three days earlier, he said, the number was 2,800. `` In 1980, there were about 80,000 people in the parish and 44,000 were unemployed,'' he said. `` Add at least 30 percent to the unemployment figure now.'' `` Unemployment always has been bad,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Altafulla </PERSON> of the slightly less impoverished <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION> parish of Christ the Redeemer. `` A lot of people here had only occasional day work and now they have lost even that.'' Caritas is feeding about 9,000 families in the province of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which includes the capital, and the number is soaring. Most of the 9,000 are in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. The Caritas food is donated or bought with donated money. `` We keep praying that people will give more food and money,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Laurino </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. He said donations are meeting the present need but worried about the near future. `` We've received nothing from the government,'' said <PERSON> Ursinis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who helped dish out cooked rice and scrambled eggs to residents of Sector 28, where she lives in Christ the Redeemer parish. `` All we have is the church and our community.'' `` Some people from the government were here with 100 bags of food to sell to government workers,'' said one man. `` They charged $ 15.60.'' `` Yesterday, -LRB- <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION> -RRB- brought rice with chicken,'' said <PERSON> Soia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, who was waiting for food. `` They try to see that everybody has enough, but each family gets the same and some families have eight or nine members.'' <PERSON> Caritas </PERSON> started giving food to churches to distribute starting in early March after banks closed because a political crisis had sparked panic among depositors. On March 3, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze Panamanian funds in American banks, one of several steps intended to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces and the power behind the civilian government, is under indictment on drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The freezing of funds deprived <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> of its supply of dollars, the official Panamanian currency, and on March 4 <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ordered the banks to remain closed. The churches stopped trying to hand out the Caritas packages last week when the crowds got too big too fast, and now the food is brought to central distribution points, cooked over wood fires and distributed to the list of the neediest compiled by the church. Even if banks were to reopen, they are critically short of dollars because of the American freeze. The government has been unable to pay most of its 130,000 employees, and the banks likely would have trouble producing dollars to cover checks waiting to be cashed. Generally, stores insist on cash and will not take checks or credit cards. <LOCATION> Caritas </LOCATION> officials say it now requires about $ 600,000 in donations a month to keep the people it feeds supplied with basics such as rice, beans, cooking oil and powdered milk. In Sector 28, a <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> worker said the list of families deemed eligible is growing by five or six families a day and that the increase is higher in other areas. `` A few people here worked for the government, a few had other jobs, all sorts of jobs,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>. `` That's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguelito </LOCATION>. We do a little of everything and a lot of nothing.''

<HEAD>Big Bucks for Corn and Bean Research Snag Trade Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Efforts to wrap up farm provisions of the 1,000-page trade bill are snagged over a plan by Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, to pump $ 75 million a year into crop research every year for 20 years. The plan is designed principally to spur demand for corn and soybeans by finding new, non-food uses for them, leading to higher farm earnings. `` It's really a long-term agricultural bill, an investment in the future,'' press secretary <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> says. Thus far, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators on the trade bill are n't so sure. The plan would be a boon for <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and similar research centers but could whet other lawmakers' appetites for more of the same for the folks back in their own states. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has been cool toward the notion thus far. And for that reason farm lawmakers were still wrangling late in the week, when most other conferees on the trade bill had reached tentative agreement. It now appears unlikely that the matter will be resolved until after April 11, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns from its spring break. As big as it is, the plant research provision is small potatoes compared to some of the subsidy programs that do have tentative approval from the trade conferees. Chief among them is a so-called `` triggered marketing loan'' program, similar to export subsidies contained in the 1985 farm law, that sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cotton and rice exports skyrocketing _ but at a hefty price to taxpayers. The latest proposal focuses on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's goal of using the current <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade talks to start the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its trading partners on a course of phasing out all agricultural subsidies. Failure to make `` substantial progress'' on such an agreement by 1990 would trigger the estimated $ 500 million marketing loan program designed to boost exports of wheat, feed grains and oilseed crops. Soybean farmers have been clamoring for a marketing loan program, under which producers receive price-support loans from the government as usual, pay them off at the lower, world price of the crop and pocket the difference. Even if Uruguay Round talks bogged down, the next president could refuse to put the 1990 marketing loan into effect if he were prepared to assure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the subsidy program would would harm the international negotiations. Doing that, however, would trigger one of the trade package's most expensive and complex features _ an offshoot of the 1985 Export Enhancement Program, which has sent millions of dollars in government-owned surplus crops to private exporters Big grain companies and other exporting firms receive the surplus crops as bonuses to spur overseas shipments of American farm products. The program remains in effect and the trade proposal would extend it through 1990 and boost the price tag from $ 1.5 billion to $ 2.5 billion. A presidential waiver of the marketing loan would automatically trigger a new export program, requiring the government to pay out no less than $ 2 billion in additional surplus-crop bonuses. These bonuses represent a heavy cost to taxpayers because the commodities were acquired mainly through unredeemed price-support loans to farmers.

 It is the evening of April 4, 1968. The Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> leans over a balcony railing at The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>. The crack of a single shot from a high-powered rifle shatters the air. Suddenly, he's gone. This much is clearly documented. But who killed the 39-year-old civil rights leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize? <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, the small-time thief who pleaded guilty, has spent the past 20 years trying to prove he did n't do it. He talks of a shadowy `` Raoul.'' Other principals in the case hold widely varying opinions: <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s attorneys disagree on whether he was the triggerman; the prosecutor acknowledges he was n't confident about the case; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the chairman of a congressional committee that studied the assassination, says he still concurs with the committee's findings that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> may have been part of a larger, unsolved conspiracy The questions remain. What of the cigarette butts found in the getaway car _ given that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> did not smoke? What of the clothing in two sizes in the car's trunk? The fatal shot came from a communal bathroom at the rear of a flophouse across a narrow street from The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> maintains he was not in that bathroom when the shot was fired. `` I was a few blocks away, trying to get a tire fixed on my car,'' he said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Brushy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> State Prison, where he is serving a 99-year sentence. `` When I started back to my room I saw a police roadblock had been set up; it was about that time that I heard on my car radio King had been shot and the police were looking for a man in a white Mustang, the same kind of car I was driving, so I took off for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who had checked into the rooming house the day King was killed, said he was in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to take part in an illicit gun-running scheme. He said the scheme was concocted by a mystery man named <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, an international smuggler whom <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> contends he met several months earlier at a waterfront bar in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He also says <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>, whom he describes as a blond man with a Latin American accent, set him up to be framed for King's murder. `` The fact is I do n't know who killed King,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who recently turned 60. `` I only pleaded guilty because I was desperate. I had been in isolation for eight months in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> jail, and <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was pressuring me to cop a plea. He was telling me my family would get in trouble and I'd get the death penalty if I did n't do what he said.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> attorney who represented <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> when he entered his guilty plea March 10, 1969, angrily disputes these assertions. `` The s.o.b. got down on his knees and thanked me for saving his life when I told him I had gotten the prosecutor to go along with a guilty plea,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said when contacted in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> recently. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, now in his mid-80s, says he thinks <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was extremely fortunate not to have stood trial. He also rejects <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s story about <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>. `` I think he acted alone,'' he said. Asked what might have motivated <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to commit such an act, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said, `` It was racism. His conversations simply steamed with racist remarks.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was a fugitive from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> State Penitentiary at the time King was killed, denies he harbored any ill will toward King and defies anyone to prove otherwise. `` King was just another politician to me,'' he said. `` Why would I want to do something like kill a big-shot politician, me a fugitive, and bring all that heat down on myself?'' He admits buying the rifle, a Remington Gamemaster, 30.06 caliber, that authorities say was the murder weapon. But he says he bought, at a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, gun shop, at <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>'s instruction and with money provided by <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>. `` I gave the rifle to <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said. `` If I had been buying it to kill <PERSON> King </PERSON>, you can bet I would n't have bought it at a gun shop. I would have gotten it from a fence, so it could n't have been traced.'' <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said he tends to believe that story. He represented <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> for four months before <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>. `` I've never believed <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> shot King,'' said <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and one-time <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> mayor. `` I personally stood in that flophouse bathroom and looked across to the motel balcony where the Rev. King was standing when he was shot. It was a difficult angle. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> simply did n't have enough expertise with rifles to make a shot like that, in my opinion.'' <PERSON> Hanes </PERSON> also said he had never heard <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> utter a single racist statement. `` I've given this case a lot of thought, and I've concluded someone assisted <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>,'' he added, `` but I ca n't say who.'' The case should have gone to trial, he said, `` to clear the air, if nothing else. I tried to get the judge to try the case, but he said there was too much pressure, from the government and the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> business community, to accept a guilty plea and avoid the publicity that a trial would generate.'' The judge, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, died a week after <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s guilty plea. However, the chief prosecutor, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Canale </PERSON>, acknowledged last week that, contrary to <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s assertion, he had been happy to get a plea from <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>. `` It would have been a big, time-consuming and expensive trial with dozens and dozens of witnesses from all over the country,'' said <PERSON> Canale </PERSON>, now an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` I have never regretted the guilty plea because we got a substantial sentence. Also, I did n't want to take a chance on getting a cranky juror and having a mistrial.''

 <PERSON> Canale </PERSON> added that although he had no eyewitness and the evidence against <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was largely circumstantial, he does n't buy the conspiracy theory. `` I think he acted alone,'' he said, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had found <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s fingerprint on the rifle discarded by the gunman near the scene of the crime. However, supporters of <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>'s story say his fingerprint was on the rifle because he had purchased it. They also note that, while <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> is a lifelong non-smoker, Viceroy cigarette butts were found in the rooming house bathroom and in his car ashtray, and that two sizes of clothing were found in his trunk. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> said the fact that <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> often used his car may explain the butts in the ashtray and clothes in the trunk. `` As for cigarettes in the bathroom I ca n't say because I was never in that bathroom,'' he said. `` My prints were never found in there, you know.'' Then there were the two white Mustangs. The late <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Canipe </PERSON>, whose amusement company was located next door to the flophouse, told investigators he saw a fleeing man ditch a rifle and a small overnight bag in front of his store and then drive away in a white Mustang, one of two that had been parked in front of the store that afternoon. He described the man as having dark hair and a beard. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was captured in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> two months after <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s death, says the fact that the gunman ditched the rifle and his bag _ which <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> says he had left in his room when he went to get the tire fixed _ shows somebody was trying to frame him. `` Why would I have dumped my stuff there for the police to find when all I had to do was put it in the car and drive away?'' he asked. After two years of hearings, ending in 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assassinations </ORGANIZATION> could n't answer that question. The committee issued a report saying <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> probably had been part of a larger conspiracy. But while the committee could n't say who else had participated in the plot, it did exonerate the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, both of which had conducted extensive illegal surveillance and smear campaigns against King throughout the 1960s. Former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> was known to have hated King. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents testified that no evidence could be found of conspiracies involving the Mafia, <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan or foreign communists. Some of <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s friends, however, still feel that letting <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigate <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s assassination was like letting a hungry fox guard a henhouse. `` I have no proof but I feel in my heart that the government, probably the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, and perhaps the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, were involved,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON>, who was with King when he died in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> hospital an hour after the shooting. `` It's just a pity but, given the way things were back then, we'll probably never know the whole truth about one of the greatest tragedies of our time.''

 About one-third of the 185 drug traffickers sentenced to death in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> since 1975 have been hanged, a <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> official said Saturday. <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, who is deputy president of a Malaysian anti-drug organization, said 62 people had been hanged and another 109 were awaiting decisions on their death-sentence appeals. <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> did not comment on the status of the remaining 14 people on death row. He did say, however, that 299 people were serving life imprisonment. In 1975, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> passed a law under which convicted drug traffickers received a death sentence or life imprisonment. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> amended the law, mandating the death sentence for traffickers. On July 7, 1986, two Australians convicted of heroin trafficking became the first whites to be hanged in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> officials have said about 500,000 of the country's 15 million people are drug addicts.

 When the clock jumps forward an hour for daylight-saving time at 2 a.m. Sunday morning, it means a little more than a lost hour of sleep. `` People's stomachs will be telling them ` Snickers bar' and we'll be serving lunch. But if you're an early eater, it'll be beneficial,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzer </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Chattanooga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riverboat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. The firm plans to serve an Easter brunch on the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> river Sunday afternoon, but the time change `` will probably affect people's appetites,'' said <PERSON> Manzer </PERSON>. Businesses and services that work on into the night lost an hour _ or gained an hour, depending on the point of view. Some police officers who work the night shift get to go home an hour early. They do n't lose an hour's pay for their `` early'' departure. And when the time changes back in the fall, they'll get an hour's overtime pay, officials said Friday. Firefighters who work 24-hour shifts are in the same situation. Some churches will hold additional services for sleepyheads and for the holiday crowds. Going visiting for Easter? The nation's public transportation system is ready for the switch, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Waymack </PERSON>, manager of a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> travel agency. `` At some points there are some minor changes in schedules, but for most airlines, cruise ships and trains, it's just another day on the job,'' <PERSON> Waymack </PERSON> said. Most of the schedule changes come about because of the season, not daylight-saving time, he said. Some flight times might be adjusted one or two minutes because of changes in headwinds, <PERSON> Waymack </PERSON> said, and others might be changed to accommodate peak passenger loads. `` It's really a very sophisticated system,'' <PERSON> Waymack </PERSON> said. `` They've had a number of years since the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers to perfect it.'' But he urged passengers to double-check departures 24 hours in advance. At <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the time change would have little effect on most banking services. However, he said, there might be a moment's hesitation when computer operators key in the commands to switch times on the banking computers, automated tellers and other equipment. `` It just depends on how quickly an operator can enter it in,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. Recorded time and temperature announcements must be changed, along with signs at banks, shopping malls and stores. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Birdsong </PERSON>, assistant to the general manager at <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s WYHY-FM, said she will have to come to the station at 2 a.m. Sunday morning to make the change in the time and temperature announcement computer. Bank and store signs are also changed by computer, usually by the owner of the sign, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Sales </PERSON> and Marketing. `` The time works off an internal clock, which you reset just as you would a digital clock,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. Time clocks must also be changed before workers punch in Monday morning. Most computerized time clocks will make the change automatically, but there will still be thousands of older models that need to be changed by hand, said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> technician <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Asplint </PERSON>. `` We could be doing daylight-saving time changes for the next two weeks,'' he said. This is the second year that daylight-saving time will begin on the first Sunday in April. Before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> changed the law, the time switch occurred on the last Sunday of April.

<HEAD>Official, Dissident Sources Say Ethnic Situation Quieter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strikes, demonstrations and tensions between national groups in two southern Soviet republics have quieted but economic damage from the unrest is severe, newspapers reported Saturday. Official and dissident sources said the atmosphere in the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> was improving. But in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, activist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said ethnic relations remained volatile. At a news conference at his north <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment, the half-Armenian former political prisoner said he had spoken with sources in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> who told him tensions have eased there and in the disputed region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. However, he said he was told some residents of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city, remained on strike. Armenian activists want <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is mostly Armenian, annexed to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. At least 32 people have died in ethnic violence in the region since late February in bloody clashes between Azeris and Armenians. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> airport had been reopened for local residents but that frequent document checks were being made at all roads leading into the region to keep outsiders away. Workers in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, angered over the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s failure to issue a clear decision on appeals to annex the region, have been staying home for more than a week. Official newspapers acknowledged labor unrest continued, but said more people have been showing up for work. In the beginning, virtually the entire adult population went out on strike. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda carried an interview with Armenian scholar <PERSON> Gevorg </PERSON> <PERSON> Garibdzhanyan </PERSON>, who accused the state-run press of telling a one-sided story about the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> situation and being too quick to label Armenian activists as extremists. But he also defended the presence of Soviet troops in the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, saying he `` slept peacefully knowing our soldiers were in the city.'' It appeared from his comments that the armed security troops that patrolled the city last month had been reduced. Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region and telephone contact with the area has been disrupted. The national television news program <ORGANIZATION> Vremya </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that public transport and many major industries in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> had been idled by the strikes and urged residents of the area to go back to work. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that some workers showed up at major enterprises in the city of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> on Friday for the first time in more than a week, although the factories were still not up to full strength. An editor who answered the telephone at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> on Saturday said the labor situation was returning to normal in the city, but declined to give his name or details. <PERSON> Selskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhizn </PERSON> newspaper wrote that state and collective farms in the troubled region had lost nearly $ 775,000 by mid-March because of strikes and demonstrations. Shortages of meat, milk and eggs have resulted, the newspaper said. Even larger losses have been reported in recent days due to the industrial strikes in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, where production and deliveries ground to a halt over the past week. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has been part of the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic since 1923, although more than three-quarters of the region's 160,000 residents are Armenians. Armenians are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, while most Azeris are Shiite Moslems. The labor situation worsened in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> in mid-March, when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership called Armenian agitation for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s annexation `` intolerable.'' While apparently rejecting the bid for reuniting the region with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the party and government leadership unveiled a program to invest $ 690 million in housing and social services like Armenian-language schools, literature and broadcasting.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> insisted Saturday on the ouster of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but sidestepped a report that he had recommended kidnapping the Panamanian strongman. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> predicted he would `` see a little headway'' when he again takes up his plan for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks next week with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called on Palestinians to participate in the negotiations, but he again ruled out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` Obviously, there are some we wo n't meet with,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said as he reiterated the 13-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of not dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until it accepts <ORGANIZATION> Irael </ORGANIZATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> held the news conference after receiving Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s blessing at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for his new venture in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that begins Sunday evening in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The pope stressed any accord must respect the `` legitimate rights'' of both Israelis and Palestinians. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> nor does it recognize its control of once-divided <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> recommended kidnapping <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and fomenting a military coup coordinated with the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper also said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Inter-American </LOCATION> affairs, suggested landing more than 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers to encourage Panamanian military officers to move against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The proposal was strongly opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who labeled it dangerous and ill-timed, said the Times, quoting unidentified adniminstration officials. Asked if he made such recommendations, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` the position of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should go. Everybody agrees about that. He's been indicted on drug charges.'' In a lengthy reply, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people have demonstrated they agree with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in opposing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were being increased to guard the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. `` We debate various possible options,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` But basically this is a question of a person who is no longer welcome in his own country by his own people and he should leave.'' When another reporter suggested <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had not really answered the question, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> showed some irritation and said, `` I never comment on speculative newspaper articles.'' Told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reportedly had described a kidnapping plot as harebrained, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` I never comment on particularly harebrained-type proposals.'' He also refused to say whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would seek <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s extradition to face criminal charges. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, are spending a leisurely weekend in the Italian capital and planned to attend the Pope's Easter Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also held a series of meetings with Italian government officials. He praised <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for its willingness to host the 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jet fighter planes that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is expelling in 1991. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had no further word from <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> on whether they would accept his proposal, but `` we expect to see a little headway.'' His plan calls for negotiations to begin May 1 on arrangements for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would deal directly with a joint delegation of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians. In December, negotiations on an overall settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute would open, also with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s participation <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he would keep working for peace even if he were turned down on his second trip to the region in a month. `` The problem is there,'' he said. `` Everybody recognizes it. And the problem is n't going to go away.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after talking with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders he could `` feel it in my bones there is an answer out there if you can only find it.''

 Thousands of dead African desert locusts have shown up on beaches just outside <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday, prompting concerns some swarms might reach <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> alive. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said winds must have pushed the insects from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and that they died in the cold weather. The Italian press expressed concern that warmer weather might allow future swarms of locusts to survive and thrive. The <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> daily Il Tempo described the scene on the beach as `` the sign of a narrowly missed invasion, or worse, of an invasion that lies at the gates.'' But experts have said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> will not be hit by the same invasion of locusts that has spread over <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Last month, the Rome-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> described the insect invasion in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as the worst in 30 years.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has considered a number of military alternatives to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but has rejected them, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief spokesman said today. Asked about a flurry of news reports that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was pushing a bold military or covert move to get <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> out, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Panamanian problem has presented `` fertile ground for a rich imagination'' about possible solutions. `` But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' intentions are to protect our citizens and our assets there,'' he said. `` There have been any number of offensive plans raised, but to this point, they have been rejected,'' he added. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has started a 10-day Easter vacation at his mountaintop ranch near here, is closely watching the situation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> prepares to send 1,300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel to strengthen the American military presence there. Shortly after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced that the additional troops would be deployed, beginning next week, to improve the security of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in the troubled country. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for weeks has been applying economic and diplomatic pressure to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by a federal grand jury in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked earlier this week if the administration was considering seizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said, `` No.'' But the spokesman told reporters accompanying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One on Friday that the administration was still `` reviewing options'' aimed at securing <PERSON> Noriegan </PERSON>'s departure. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decision to send additional manpower, many of them military police officers, came in the wake of a march by Panamanian troops on a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel earlier in the week. During that incident, several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalists were detained briefly, and authorities confiscated videotapes of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be kept abreast of several matters while the president and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, relax at <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cielo </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. `` He'll get daily intelligence updates on world situations,'' the spokesman said. `` He could get special information on three or four areas of interest. One is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a continuing problem to keep an eye on.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also will be kept informed of any progress that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> makes as he renews the administration's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacemaking efforts with visits to several countries in the region. The president also will be briefed on the goings-on in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the Marxist Sandinista regime is scheduled to enter talks with the Contra rebels Tuesday aimed at bringing about democratic reforms envisioned in a truce agreement signed March 23. But the political and governmental crisis in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> seemed sure to take much of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attention. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sought to minimize the possibility of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force being used to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Last Monday, for instance, he told high school students in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, he did not think the citizens of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> wanted to see `` the great colossus of the North'' flex its muscles there. But the administration apparently has become increasingly frustrated as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived an array of economic sanctions. These include the withholding of payments the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes to the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> under terms of the 1979 treaties providing for the canal to be gradually turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the turn of the century. In another effort to turn the financial screws on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the administration on Thursday announced steps to stop <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars from flowing into the Central American nation. The administration is concerned that the continuing flow of tax payments by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations with operations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has served to sustain the existing government headed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The first family plans a quiet Easter vacation, which lasts through April 10. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there were no plans for get-togethers at the ranch by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> relatives, and it could not be learned whether the first couple would leave the mountain to attend Easter services here _ as they did last year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s lone public outing is an appearance Monday at a luncheon of some 75 supporters of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidential library. He is scheduled to make a foreign policy address to a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, en route back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 10.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders today urged followers to love God above worldly success and prepare themselves for the second coming of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. In the opening session of the 158th Annual General Conference of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>, leaders said service to God and love of Christ should be the highest priority of the faithful. `` We should put God ahead of everyone else in our lives,'' said President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, the 88-year-old spiritual leader of the 6.5 million member church. `` When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper places or drop out of our lives. Our love of God will govern the claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we pursue and the order of our priorities,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. The sermon was the first of three scheduled to be delivered by <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who has been convalescing from a heart attack the past six months. Church spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who served as secretary of agriculture during the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administration, appeared to be in good health and excellent spirits. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> was one of 22 of the church's general authorities scheduled to speak during the conference's five sessions. General authorities are full-time clergy who lead the church under the direction of the First Presidency, which consists of <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and counselors <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>. Thousands of lay clergymen and other church members from around the world have gathered for the two-day conference held in the Tabernacle on Temple Square in downtown <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. During this morning's opening session, leaders stressed fundamental church doctrines, such as belief in resurrection and atonement of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the importance of missionary work. Leaders were expected to announce this afternoon that convert baptisms reached an all-time high during 1987. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> said the exact figure would not be released prior to the afternoon session, but said it was about 250,000. He said the church's full-time, volunteer missionary force also has reached an all-time high of 34,200 men and women. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, urged church members to prepare for <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s second coming, but said they should not believe the rapture necessarily is near at hand. The Council of the Twelve are second to the First Presidency in the church hierarchy, and assist in directing the church. `` Over the sweep of Christian history, by focusing on a few prophecies while neglecting others, some believers have prematurely expected the second coming. Today, while obviously closer to that great moment, we are in the same danger,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, smugness is also a real danger.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> noted that a number of Biblical prophecies said to be precursors of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s return already have occurred. Among them, he said, is the return of the Jewish people to the Holy Land. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, of the Council of the Twelve, said Mormons should get involved in community affairs and promote honest government, neighborhood beautification and high educational standards. `` Rather than spend time complaining about the direction in which these institutions are going, we need to exert our influence in shaping the right direction. A small effort by a few can result in so much good for all mankind,'' he said.

 An apparent fuel spill stretched about 70 miles down the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> today from near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this point it smells like diesel fuel, so we are assuming it is diesel fuel,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said his agency had contacted water companies along the river and health officials in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. `` Our first step is trying to find a source and secure the source,'' <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said. `` There is about a 1-foot chop on the river right now. To contain the oil is almost an impossibility,'' he added. Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickerson </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> post in <LOCATION> Sellersburg </LOCATION> said investigators had used a helicopter this morning to track the spill about 70 miles. `` It's not thick and heavy all the way, but there are traces of it. It's heaviest between Madison -LRB- in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- across the river from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said. `` We do n't know exactly what it is, some kind of petroleum,'' he said. `` One report I got from the -LRB- police -RRB- radio was that it was in spots as wide as the river. They say it is a real thin film, but they do n't know if it is a fuel or a chemical,'' said patrolman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of the police department in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, about halfway between <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> residents began reporting a strong diesel fuel smell Friday night. He said officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana-Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> generating plant took a boat out to check the river and discovered the spill shortly after 6:30 a.m.

<TEXT>
 Consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> is criticizing the rise in postage rates and urging consumers to organize and insist on a voice in postal affairs. The new postage rates, including a 3-cent rise in the cost of mailing a first-class letter, take effect Sunday. It will now cost 25 cents to mail a letter. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> termed the increase a `` harsh blow'' on individuals and said the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> routinely hears from businesses and non-profit groups about mail service and rates, but not from the average consumer. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s solution is to form a group called Residential Postal Action. `` If we can get 10,000 people to write in, we could escalate this to something significant,'' he said in a recent telephone interview. `` Clearly, there is a great imbalance of representation,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said, and a consumer group `` can help even the scales.'' The rate hike comes at a time when congressional budget cuts have forced the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to curtail window hours and some collections. At the same time, proposals to allow private firms to begin competing in the delivery of first-class mail have been put forth. This combination of factors `` threaten the stability of what was once a well-regarded public service'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said in a letter to Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to find ways to cut costs without reducing services. He called on interested individuals to write to Residential Postal Action, P.O. Box 19367, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, 20036. The group could be funded through voluntary member contributions, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> gave his blessing Saturday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s new <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace mission and stressed that any settlement must respect the rights of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Palestinians. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is on a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, briefed the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> on his <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace proposals during a 30-minute private audience in the papal library. `` God bless your efforts,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as the two posed for pictures with the rest of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation after the meeting. `` I go from here to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with your blessing to sustain the effort'' to promote <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace negotiations, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> responded. The American plan calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to give land to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in exchange for peace. Under the plan, negotiations would begin May 1 on arrangements for self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinians on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would deal directly with a joint delegation made up of <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION> and Palestinians. In December, negotiations on an overall settlement of the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute would open with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s participation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy leaves Sunday for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the first stop on a trip that will also take him to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> visited the region last month but found no consensus for an agreement. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also discussed the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> situation with his <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> counterpart, Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>. `` Progress comes in small increments,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, holding up his thumb and index finger close together to stress his point. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have a `` common preoccupation for international peace,'' and their talks focused on East-West relations, `` the continuing grave situation'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and developments in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The pope `` insisted on the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and on the moral duty to find a solution that also takes into account the legitimate rights of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> voiced `` great interest in the efforts under way for the search, obligatory for everyone, of a process that opens the way to solutions acceptable to all,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. The pope has spoken frequently in favor of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have cited the Palestinian question, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s unsettled boundaries and the status of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as reasons for the absence of ties The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> also does not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. At a news conference later in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> declined to give details of his meeting with the pope. `` It is always an extraordinary privilege to have the opportunity to talk with his holiness the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I have benefited greatly from that audience.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was asked whether in his talks with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and Italian officials he had urged them to play a role in <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace efforts. `` I found very warm support for our efforts and a readiness to help in any way they can,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Episcopalian </PERSON>, brought to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Saturday an entourage of 31 people, including his wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic. It was <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s third meeting at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. He and his wife visited the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1986 for Easter.

 Democratic acting Gov. Rose Mofford has walked a tightrope in the nearly two months since Republican Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached, and from all appearances she has enjoyed nearly every minute of it. `` She's everyone's Auntie Rose,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Resnick </PERSON>, and there's proof in the way children come up without prompting to hug the tall woman with the white beehive hairdo. `` She may not be the kind of technocrat some people want her to be, but she certainly knows people,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. She moved quickly to calm <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s troubled political waters after <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was impeached on Feb. 5 and she, as secretary of state, took his office until he is acquitted or ousted. Her bipartisan volunteer staff included many who served under <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s predecessor, Democratic Gov <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s fate up in the air pending a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> verdict on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> impeachment allegations, plus an upcoming criminal trial and recall election, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has avoided any policy initiatives beyond indicating a willingness to consider tax hikes that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> opposes. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> did not seek a place on the ballot in the May 17 recall election, but a draft committee gathered enough petition signatures to put her on anyway and she is the favorite in a seven-way race. A court challenge has been filed arguing that she can not remain on the ballot unless she files a financial disclosure report. If she files that, she could be considered to be actively campaigning and that, under <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law, would mean she would have to resign both as acting governor and as secretary of state. `` God only knows what the future holds for <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, but I'm telling you while I'm sitting up there as acting governor I'm there to serve you,'' she told a luncheon club in one of her many public appearances Besides speaking at building dedications, county fairs and countless luncheons and dinners, she has posed for photos with school children, cotton farmers, mayors, basketball players, lawmakers, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Funicello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>. As she goes, she hands out Mofford pens, address books and watches. When she is n't making speeches, she can be found flipping through her three huge rotary files for the telephone number of those who are on her list of birthdays or anniversaries that day. `` No matter who you want to see, honey, you call me _ I'll probably know him,'' she tells visitors In her 46 years in state government, many of the roles she's filled have had little substance, and there are conflicting views of how well she will do on heavier matters But a statewide poll released by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> last week gave Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> an 81 percent approval rating for her job performance. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is automatically on the ballot unless he is ousted via impeachment in a vote expected this week. Also on the ballot are another Democrat, two Republicans and two minor candidates. As secretary of state, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s duties included such non-controversial functions as keeping the state's Great Seal, attesting to official acts of government and handling government publications. The office also keeps records on lobbyists and campaign financing, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, former executive director of the government watchdog organization <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, says the state has done a poor job in that area. `` I think they tried real hard,'' he said of Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and the secretary of state staff, `` but the system they used for maintaining any files that I was primarily interested in was not a good one.'' Records often were missing and there was no attempt to enforce or have the state attorney general's office enforce laws against violations, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> says. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> was `` not really interested in the compliance end of things unless somebody made waves, especially the press,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and other defenders of <LOCATION> Mofford </LOCATION> note that she had to contend with a GOP-controlled Legislature and was short-staffed, and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> himself acknowledged that record-keeping improved somewhat with addition of computers. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is divorced and has no children. She began her government career in 1941 as a secretary, and she has worked for or with 11 of the state's 16 governors. She was appointed assistant secretary of state in 1955 and secretary of state 22 years later. She won the post in her own right in 1978, 1982 and 1986, each time by wide margins. Her honeymoon in office is in sharp contrast to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who seemingly never had one. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> became the subject of criticism from the start over errors, news conferences, appointments, hirings and firings, and his cancellation of a state Martin Luther King holiday established by <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has drawn little public criticism in such areas, and there also has been little stir over her generally having refused to voice her opinion on major pending bills. `` I think <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is a very capable person,'' said Republican House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. `` She's been very conciliatory toward me.'' `` She does n't offend folks,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>.

 A telephone company has decided to print a photo of acting Gov. Rose Mofford instead of impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in an advertisment for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, a spokesman says. <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, has been running a series of full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal highlighting each of the 14 states in its territory. Each ad in the series, which cost $ 1.4 million and started in January, includes a picture of the portrayed state's governor and text provided by the governor. The ads are intended to emphasize the states' strong points and to encourage business development in the company's service area. The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ad was slated to run early in the series, which began in January, but was delayed because of circumstances surrounding <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, company officials said in February. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is winding up <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial, with closing arguments scheduled Monday. The first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> also faces an April 21 criminal trial and a May 17 recall election.

 Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> <PERSON> Village </PERSON>, a giant public housing project once called <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>'s `` greatest Christmas gift,'' has come unwrapped. `` The mice run around like they're paying the rent instead of you,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the Concerned Tenants of Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> <PERSON> Village </PERSON>. People are a problem too. `` They're selling guns like it's the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and they're dealing -LRB- drugs -RRB- in the open,'' she said. The project could lose millions of federal dollars if city officials do n't follow orders to tear parts of it down, partially reconstruct it, and relocate about 1,300 of the estimated 4,000 residents to other housing in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>. Tenants of the complex claim that some of the 41 three-story buildings are in such poor shape and crime so pervasive that living there puts them in peril. `` I would say it's one of the worst projects in the country,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` Several years ago the modernization money was not used properly, and we're afraid the bricks are going to pop off the buildings and someone could get killed,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` You just ca n't have a dump sitting there and that's more or less what Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> is.'' Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> <PERSON> Village </PERSON> began as Yellow Mill Village on Dec. 23, 1939. It was renamed in 1955 in honor of the Rev. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Panik </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who served as the first chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Brideport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and was considered a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> pioneer in low-rent housing projects. `` For it means perhaps the greatest Christmas gift that ever was given to the people of <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> _ not a promise, but the beginning of a reality, fine decent homes for about 5,000 people at rentals that are well within their means,'' <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> said at a ceremony in 1939. Today the largest housing project in the state's largest city looks like a battlefield. Gunshots occasionally echo within the project and drug deals are routinely made on street corners. Walls are marked with graffiti and the hallways smell of urine. At least 90 percent of the residents are single parents with an average of two children and annual incomes of $ 5,000 to $ 10,000. The federal government has given the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> $ 36 million to demolish 13 buildings, relocate residents to new quarters to be created around the city, and rebuild some units. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is waiting to see if those directions are carried out before it makes plans or allocates any more money to improve the rest of the project. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> BHA </ORGANIZATION> has been slow in submitting its plans. `` We should have had the application for the demolition by the end of December and it's not in yet,'' he said. `` We'll give them an extension, but we're kind of tired of giving them extensions.'' He said if the city does n't make progress by April 15, he'll recommend canceling the federal grant <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> BHA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency is determined to meet its deadlines. `` All of the little pieces show we're moving ahead,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said. But so far the authority has located only 10 sites to fit 88 apartments, leaving them short of locations for 251 units that must be moved in the first phase of the project. `` The problem is <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> does not have all of the resources to do things as quickly and well as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would like,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` It would be very self-defeating if <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> punished the residents and city for inadequacies that exist that we're trying to work out. Meanwhile, tenants of Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> are uneasy about the future, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of the tenants' group. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has lived in Father <PERSON> Panik </PERSON> for all but two of her 36 years, said that even if it is torn down and rebuilt, crime problems will linger. `` If they do n't do something about the security here, it does n't matter if they call it mud,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucci </PERSON> said the village is `` one of the city's most important priorities. `` It is known as being one of the worst housing complexes in the country and that reputation naturally is associated with the city,'' <PERSON> Bucci </PERSON> said. `` It's not moving as quickly as we'd like, but progress is being made.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enhance federal support of scientific research, saying `` we could n't be where we are'' without such exploration. In his weekly radio address, delivered from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, the president said that while spending for scientific research is 58 percent higher than a decade ago, after discounting for inflation, this is insufficient. He said that since World War II, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has won more Nobel Prizes for science than <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> combined, and that this country must not lose its world leadership role. He said that scientific research, unlike the construction of bridges, interstate highways and courthouses, has no local constituency. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not let this political fact of life get in the way of continuing breakthroughs. Without such exploration, `` we could n't be where we are today,'' he said. `` We can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can see.''

 A storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, snarling traffic and causing power outages, while heavy rain caused flooding in which one person drowned and dozens of people had to evacuate from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Tornadoes touched down in four east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> towns Friday, destroying at least two mobile homes, damaging dozens of homes _ some blown off their foundations _ and overturning cars. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION> both got eight inches of rain in 12 hours, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Three tornadoes touched down in nearby <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, damaging homes and bn businesses but causing no injuries, police said. About 150 people were evacuated from lowlying subdivisions in <LOCATION> Marrero </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. One <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> woman drowned when her car turned off a flooded street into a drainage canal, police said. In northwest <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the storm dropped 22 inches of snow on <PERSON> Goodwell </PERSON> and about 15 inches on Guymon. The Highway Patrol closed roads and discouraged travel in the area. `` Everyone keeps saying when they come in, ` April Fools' Day,''' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who called the towering snow drifts outside her Guymon auto shop a cruel joke. `` It's <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>.

Most roads were closed west of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` There are times when you ca n't even see across the street,'' said <PERSON> Rayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Stanton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office in <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` We have a blizzard, with no electricity and no heat,'' said a <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, sheriff's dispatcher who refused to give his name `` The only thing I've got that works is a telephone.'' A bus with 39 people aboard slid into a ditch in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, along with other vehicles on Friday, but no injuries were reported, authorities said. A motel and high school gymnasium were filled with stranded travelers. Rain-swollen rivers jumped their banks in northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Flooding in <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> forced the evacuation Friday night of about 20 homes and seven businesses in <LOCATION> Skiatook </LOCATION>. Water began spilling over the creek banks around noon Friday and was rising at a rate of a foot an hour, said <ORGANIZATION> Skiatook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>. The river was expected to crest today near 26 feet; flood stage is 21 feet. About 30 flood victims spent Friday night at a shelter in the Skiatook Community Building, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. In <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, about seven families were moved out of homes because of rising water. `` They're kind of used to it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarkson </PERSON>. `` They just kind of put things up high on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''

<TEXT>
 With 23 more deaths reported Saturday, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s troubled state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has suffered the bloodiest week since Sikh rebels first began calling for a separate nation six years ago. Last week's death toll of 120 has prompted calls for imposing a federal emergency in the northern state and already may have crippled the government's latest effort to reach a compromise with militants of the religious minority. Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> called the appointed governor of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION>, and state Police Chief <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribiero </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Saturday to plan new initiatives against the violence. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> told reporters that the government would keep up its `` relentless war'' against the Sikh radicals who have been blamed for more than 630 killings this year. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said Sikh militants shot to death six people Saturday night in the village of <LOCATION> Ragarh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district, adding to the 17 deaths reported since Friday night. No new government actions were announced Saturday, but Sikhs in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> expressed fears that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s goverment would declare an emergency, severely limiting civil rights and imposing harsh police rule. `` This is an excuse by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to impose emergency on the state,'' <PERSON> Darshan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragi </PERSON>, a Sikh religious leader, said Saturday at his home near <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>. `` The bullet is not an answer to any problem, either from the militants or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>.'' At the same time, opposition political leaders and some in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demanded action. And three radical groups issued a statement blaming the latest killings on police agents. `` All this is being done to defame the militant Sikh youths in the eyes of the Sikh masses so that the movement for <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION> is weakened,'' said a statement from the radical groups. L.K. <PERSON> Advani </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, demanded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> impose a security belt along <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, believed to be the source of the AK-47 assault rifles used by the rebels in their latest onslaught. Past efforts to seal the porous border, the traditional domain of smugglers on both sides, have failed. Harsh police action, exemplified by the Indian army's raid on the Sikhs' Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> in 1984, has succeeded only in turning ordinary Sikhs against the government. The June 1984 raid to drive radicals from the shrine left more than 1,200 people dead, most of them Sikhs. Soon afterwards, Sikh bodyguards killed Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother Sikh radicals began openly demanding an independent <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION> _ `` land of the pure'' in the Punjabi language. The killings are spiraling despite the <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION> government's direct federal rule over <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since last May when it invoked Indian law to dislodge the elected state government of Sikh moderates In March alone, 272 victims were gunned down, compared to 215 who died in the first three months of last year. The latest police reports confirm the pattern of random killings with the victims both Hindus and Sikhs. In the neighboring villages of <LOCATION> Tara </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kaler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gurdaspur </LOCATION> district, two sets of Hindu brothers, in their 60s and 70s, were shot to death Friday night by four men with AK-47 rifles. In <LOCATION> Tara </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, all but two of the 50 houses in the village were deserted by families fleeing the persistent violence. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, a Hindu, said he and a few other villagers had been coming during the day to mind their fields and shops. After Friday night's slayings, he said: `` We will not come back at all. We are not able to stay here with the terror.'' Sikhs, whose religion is a mixture of <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, make up only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million population, but they are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The radicals argue that only a separate Sikh nation can save the minority faith from being overwhelmed by the Hindus, who comprise more than 80 percent of the country's people. Ironically, some Sikh sources say the upsurge in killings results from a new effort by the government to find a compromise with the militants through <PERSON> Jasbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rode </PERSON>, a 34-year-old Sikh preacher. Rode was among about 40 Sikhs who were freed in early March after being imprisoned without trial. He was promptly elected to the most powerful post in the Sikh faith amid reports his freedom was part of a government move to compromise with the radicals _ or divide them. Rode has denied there were any conditions to his release, and the government has not publicly outlined its plans. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was asked in an interview published Saturday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> why he had decided to release Rode and other imprisoned Sikhs `` We have tried everything else,'' he replied.

<HEAD>Auto Talks: Few Obstacles Seen to Smooth Contract Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s labor problems, inflamed by the closing of a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> plant and the threatened sale of a parts subsidiary, are not expected to prevent it and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> from reaching a settlement in contract talks this month. Since <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed down in early March from the planned sale of its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary, caustic rhetoric and threats of crippling strikes have been replaced by silence as negotiators prepare demands and strategies for the opening of talks April 18. The union's demands will be discussed and approved by the 140-member <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> national <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> council during a meeting this week in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The talks are likely to be much less dramatic than the unrest that led to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to negotiate early, since the contract must follow an industry pattern contract established last fall at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and used at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The framework should be there, and the readiness to bargain early should generally be an admission that things will go smoothly,'' said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON>, labor and technology expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON> added: `` Given all the trauma -LRB- at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in recent years, there could be a surprise. There is discontent in Chrysler plants, a real unease that could come out in this bargaining.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s contract covering 59,500 active workers and 8,000 on layoff expires Sept. 14. The <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> wanted to adapt the three-year <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> contracts to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, however, did n't agree until it backed off from the <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> sale, realizing it had opened a wound that would only fester if left until the normal mid-July opening of talks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s workers agreed to concessions in the early 1980s to help the company survive its brush with bankruptcy. Many workers say they are disillusioned because a spirit of camaraderie, of fighting together, has disappeared now that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is in the black and their contributions are n't so keenly needed or appreciated. `` The average auto worker at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> in 1979-81 had no business assuming they were going to have a job there. But they made it through beautifully, the company's done very well. To now have to start worrying about your job is very nerve-wracking,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckey </PERSON>, an independent auto industry analyst who has worked closely with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. Indeed, 5,500 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members are to lose their jobs this summer when <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closes a plant at <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, that it acquired last year when it bought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The union and state and local officials protested bitterly when the plan was revealed, saying <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had promised to operate the plant for up to three years, but <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> insists there was no agreement and that the market does not justify keeping the 86-year-old factory open. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also appears to want to close at least one assembly plant not previously announced and possibly more than the six announced <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> plants planned for closing the next two ye <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also will maintain heavy pressure to produce the most products with the fewest workers possible, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON>, industry analyst with <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. While vital to all automakers, cost-cutting is crucial at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> because its sales depend on keeping its prices lower than <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> said. The pattern contract includes these protections for workers: _ A ban on plant closings _ Job security provisions that forbid layoffs unless sales of a particular product fall and restrict transfer of inside work to outside suppliers Workers who otherwise would be laid off because of subcontracted work or improvements in technology or efficiency are put into a job bank where they receive most of their regular pay and often retraining. _ An agreement for the two sides to study jointly over six months ways to improve quality and productivity at each plant, preventing the company from abruptly forcing drastic workplace changes on plants by threatening to close those whose workers refuse Among potential obstacles to a quick and eventually healing settlement is what many view as a loophole in the pattern contract. Although the pattern contract forbids plant closings, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has skirted that obstacle by simply laying off all the workers at a plant whose product is n't selling well and indefinitely idling the factory. In the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> talks, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are expected to seek a tighter definition of indefinite idling, a difficult task and one likely to be resisted by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shaiken </PERSON> said. `` It would be difficult to renegotiate the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> contracts at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> voiced fear Saturday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could slip to a second-rate world power in technology, saying scientific research is `` an indispensable investment in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future.'' `` We can travel as far as the eye of our imagination can see,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address to the nation. `` But one thing is certain: If we do n't, others will, and we'll fall behind.'' `` This is why I've urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to devote more money to research,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the speech delivered from his ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> near this seaside resort city. `` This year, we'll begin work on the great-grandchild of those particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic growth,'' he said. `` It's called the super-conducting supercollider. And it will harness the galloping technology of superconductivity so we can explore sub-atomic particles in ways we've never been able to before.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that `` we'll also continue developing the space station. When it's in orbit, the space station will let us perform once-impossible experiments in the weightless environment of outer space, and understand our world and universe better.'' `` Meanwhile, back on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, we will be pursuing breakthroughs in biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine, agriculture and protection of the environment,'' he said. But in his talk, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged that scientific research is expensive. `` Some say that we ca n't afford it _ that we're strapped for cash,'' he said. `` Well, leadership means making hard choices, even in an election year.'' Without citing dollars-and-cents figures, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that federal spending for scientific research is 58 percent higher than a decade ago, after discounting for inflation. But he indicated this is still not enough. `` We've put our research budget under a microscope and looked for quality and cost-effectiveness,'' he said. `` We've put together the best program for the taxpayers' dollars. `` After all, the American tradition of hope is one we ca n't afford to forget `` The problem here is that science, unlike a bridge or an interstate highway or a courthouse, has no local constituency,'' he said. `` Federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of budget constraints. That's why it's my duty as president to draw its importance to your attention and that of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A 25-pound lobster that nearly became somebody's Easter dinner has been rescued and will be jetting to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> on Monday to live out its old age beneath the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Publicity forced a seafood company owner, a seafood lover, an animal-rights group and the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> into an unlikely alliance to save the creature, which was estimated to be between 40 and 125 years old. Also saved from the pot was a 19 -RCB- - pound companion `` This was something that strikes you in your moral craw,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Felscher-Cohen </PERSON>, vice president of the rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Pity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Not </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruelty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Here is a very old lobster and it just seemed disgusting that it should end its life to the cruelest predator _ man _ in a pot of boiling water.'' The 25-pounder, equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts, arrived from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on March 25 after an order got mixed up at <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s Main <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>. When owner <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> recovered from his astonishment, he and his staff dubbed her <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>. Then he sold her and the other hefty crustacean to a regular customer, a retired carpenter from <LOCATION> Haverford </LOCATION>, for $ 287. But before <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> was out the door, The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer ran a story about her, and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s phone began ringing with calls from lobster advocates, including Ms. <PERSON> Felscher-Cohen </PERSON>. She told him it would be a `` lovely gesture'' during the Passover and Easter holidays to celebrate themes of freedom and resurrection by buying back the lobsters. She even offered to top the carpenter's price. After several calls like that, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was convinced. When the carpenter came to pick up the second lobster, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> offered him $ 387 for both. `` His first feeling was ` What do you mean they're going to take the lobsters?''' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` Look, there's too many people -LRB- calling -RRB-. Let's free the things.'' The customer, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, agreed to exchange the large lobsters for 45 pounds of smaller ones, rather than for money. `` I think it's ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` What's the difference between a one-pound lobster and a 25-pound lobster?'' Pity Not Cruelty, meanwhile, had already made arrangements with the state of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to turn the creatures loose. The group assumed the flight costs. Crated and covered with seaweed, the lobsters are due to fly to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Monday afternoon for a few hours of observation. `` If they are healthy, we will liberate them the next day,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fessenden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. They should be freed off the shore of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, by the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> Head Light, he said. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, he added, it would be illegal to catch <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, because she is much longer than the five-inch maximum -LRB- measured from the rear of the eye socket to the end of the body shell -RRB- allowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. The older lobsters are protected, he said, because they have more offspring. His department will probably investigate <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s origins, he said. The state helped save a 23 -LCB- - pound Alaskan lobster from gourmands last November, he said That lobster `` was very lively,'' he said. `` I'm pretty optimistic that these will fare as well.''

<HEAD>Restoration Shows How Master Reworked Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Restoration work on <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s `` Danae,'' which was cut and splashed with acid by an attacker in 1985, has revealed how the Dutch painter reworked the 17th century masterpiece, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday. Restoration experts in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> using X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared light, have completed the first stage of their work and now are getting ready to retouch the areas where the original paint was destroyed, the report said. A `` case history'' of hundreds of pages has been recorded, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The painting was damaged June 15, 1985, by what officials described as a `` madman'' who threw sulphuric acid on it and slashed it twice with a knife at <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s Hermitage museum. Soviet art officials have said the damage was serious, but never have said specifically how much of the painting was destroyed. Restorers, including chemists, biologists, physicists and other scientists, began work immediately on the canvas. The painting depicts the mother of <PERSON> Perseus </PERSON>, who, according to Greek legend, killed <PERSON> Medusa </PERSON> and her head of snakes. Soviet art books say <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> painted `` Danae'' in 1636 and repainted it in 1646-1647. `` X-ray studies showed that <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> had repainted the gesture of the right hand, changed the appearance of the old woman looking from behind the canopy, that he had painted over <PERSON> Danae </PERSON>'s earrings and beads, and that he had altered her facial features several times in the course of the work,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Experts also established that the 81-inch canvas was actually two pieces that had been skillfully sewn together, covered first with a brown primer, a layer of gray and then whiting. `` It is our immutable principle not to paint over even a single millimeter of the author's painting,'' <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, head of the restoration effort, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now we are beginning work on those sections where the layer of paint had been washed off, and advancing from the sides of the painting to the four epicenters that suffered most from the acid. We are drawing copies of ` <PERSON> Danae </PERSON>' to master <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON>'s style,'' he said. The experts also tried to restore the painting's lacquer, which had seriously deteriorated in several places, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The report said experts would not speculate on when restoration work would be done, but that they were confident the painting would be displayed once more in the Hermitage when the work is completed.

 Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> should n't have to look for a new tailor any time soon. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Payseno </PERSON> offered to make a new overcoat for the governor after a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> attorney walked off with <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>'s coat.

The coat is too large because the governor furnished his measurements before he lost more than 20 pounds on a diet. `` Rather than make the coat fit by gaining the weight back, we're going to go alter the coat,'' <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said. `` It's certainly large enough.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address Saturday, as delivered from his ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. My fellow Americans, Passover and Easter are festivals of hope. That's why this weekend is a good time for all of us to reflect on the enduring importance to mankind of hope and faith in the future, and nowhere do our hopes take more visible form than in the quest of science. Science has grown, and with it the fascination it holds for all us. But as the pursuit of science has become ever more nationally and even multinationally funded, it has also become more expensive. The problem here is that science, unlike a bridge or an interstate highway or a courthouse, has no local constituency. Today, when we are witnessing some of the most exciting discoveries in the history of science, things similar to the breakthroughs associated with <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gallileo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, federal funding for science is in jeopardy because of budget constraints. That's why it's my duty as President to draw it's importance to your attention and that of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. American has long been the world's scientific leader. Over the years, we've secured farm more patents than any other country in the world. And since World War II, we have one more Nobel prizes for science than the Europeans and Japanese combined. We also support more of what is called `` basic research.'' That is, research meant to teach us, rather than to invent or develop new products. And for the past 40 years the government has been our leading sponsor of basic research. The remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal, when you look at the results over the years, it ends up being one of the most practical things government does. For example, government-sponsored basic research produced the first laser. Today, less than three decades later, lasers are used in everything from microsurgery to the transmission of immense volumes of information and may contribute to our Strategic Defense Initiative that promises to make ballistic missiles obsolete. When I think that over the past 50 years the government has helped build a number of particle accelerators so scientists could study high-energy physics, major industries, including television, communications and computer industries, could n't be where they are today without devlopments that began with this basic research. We can not know where scientific research will lead. The consequences and spin-offs are unknown and unknowable until they happen. In research, as <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> once said, `` Imagination is more important than knowledge.'' We can travel wherever the eye of our imagination can see. But one thing is certain: If we do n't explore, others will, and we'll fall behind This is why I've urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to devote more money to research. After taking out inflation, today's government research expenditures are 58 percent greater than the expenditures of a decade ago. It is an indispensable investment in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future. Let me tell you about just a few of the many projects we'll fund this year. This year, we'll begin work on the great-grandchild of those particle accelerators that have meant so much to our economic growth. It's called the super-conducting supercollider, and it will harness the galloping technology of superconductivity so we can explore sub-atomic particles in ways we've never been able to before. We'll also continue developing the space station. When it's in orbit, the space station will let us perform once-impossible experiments in the weightless and sterile environment of outer space, and understand our world and universe better. And we're developing new technology to allow man eventually to journey beyond earth's orbit Astronaut Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> and others in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have given the space program the support it needs to once again reach for the stars. Meanwhile, back on earth, we will be pursuing breakthroughs in biotechnology that promise to revolutionize medicine, agriculture and protection of the environment. We're working on new ways to spread the seeds of federal research. Working with universities across the country, we have established 14 engineering research centers devoted to basic research on emerging technologies. And we're planning 10 to 15 new science and technology centers to do the same thing in the fields of general science. All of these centers will work with industry so that what they discover can quickly lead to new and better and internationally competitive products. All of this and more is before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now. Some say that we ca n't afford it, that we're too strapped for cash. Well, leadership means making hard choices, even in an election year. We've put our research budget under a microscope and looked for quality and cost-effectiveness. We've put together the best program for the taxpayers' dollars. After all, the American tradition of hope is one we ca n't afford to forget. Until next week, Happy Easter and Passover. God bless you.

<TEXT>
 Former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> on Saturday warned Democrats that an attempt to deny the party's nomination to the front-runner at the convention could spell defeat in November. `` I do n't want to see a big, divisive fight at the convention and a desperate attempt to block the front-runner because I think that would bring a repeat of 1972,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said efforts by some Democrats to block his nomination despite his delegate lead going into the 1972 Democratic convention split the party and contributed to his landslide defeat to then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the general election. `` It really cost us heavily. The fallout was devastating,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. `` Those last-minute, desperation blocking efforts contributed to the Democratic defeat in the fall,'' he said. `` We should not repeat that experience in 1988.'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>'s advice to fall in line behind a front-runner echoes a similar call by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who also wants the nomination settled before the convention. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said a brokered convention is unnecessary because `` the voters are the brokers and they are making it clear that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are the two candidates who command the most support.'' `` After the last primary, we should rally around whichever of these two front-runners has the most delegates,'' he said. If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> end up in a `` virtual dead heat'' after all the primaries, then the convention delegates should decide which will be the candidiate, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. `` But if one of the candidates compiles a significant first-place win, he is entitled to the nomination,'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said the Democratic race has narrowed to `` a two-man race now'' between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. He said neither Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> nor Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is likely to pull ahead, but he said he was not suggesting they drop out. `` That's a judgment they should make, but I think that if at the end they come up as short as they are now, they should get behind the front-runner,'' he said. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> has not endorsed anyone in the race yet. He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` offers a message of hope and reconciliation'' and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` offers a record of experience and competence in government.'' Democrats should evaluate both `` progressive spirited men'' and nominate the one with the most delegates, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans are complaining that the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has n't acted quickly enough on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s federal judge appointees. `` There is no reason, why we ca n't with a little extra hard work, hold hearings when necessary and move some of the nominations presently pending out of this committee,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said at a recent committee hearing. But Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., who heads the ad hoc subcommittee that screens candidates, denied there has been any foot-dragging over nominations And <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> in a letter, `` Your concern is misplaced.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> also said there is no truth to a rumor circulating on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would not take up any executive or judicial nominations if they were not received by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, by April `` I do n't know where that rumor came from,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Sen. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> never told me anything like that. Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also told me that he has received no such instructions.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has been running the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the absence of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., who is at home recovering from <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>'s spokeswomen, also said that <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> had not made a demand on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s committee chairmen for nominations by early April. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, backed by other Republicans on the Judiciary panel, complained about what he called `` the extremely slow pace that the committee is processing nominations this year.'' In 1986, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> received 145 nominations and 139 were confirmed, including two <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices, 11 appeals court judges and 33 district court judges. That was the last year the Republicans controlled the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said there are currently 36 judicial nominees waiting for committee action, five of which are for the appeals court and 21 for the district court. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said some of the nominees have been waiting for nearly a year for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action. Others have been waiting months. Specifically, he cited the nominations of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which has been pending eight months, and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Summitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, six months, both for the appellate court; and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadola </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 11 months, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, eight months, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, four months, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, four months, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, three months and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, three months, for the district bench. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> had written to <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> three times in March complaining about what he described as `` the extremely slow pace that the committee is processing nominations so far this year.'' In a reply, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> wrote: `` I believe your concern is misplaced.'' He said the committee had received nine nominations to the federal courts this year thus far. He said his committee had already held hearings on 11 nominations with seven more scheduled. `` I can offer you my personal assurance that, as far as I am concerned, every single judicial nomination that comes before this committee will be considered fairly, thoroughly, and without any unjustified delay,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> wrote. `` I know <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> -RRB- shares this attitude, and I believe the committee has lived up to this standard throughout his chairmanship.''

The preliminary study also has found that too many students do n't give enough thought to their major and suggests a need for better advising. The results are too new to have been properly interpreted, cautions <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> on Assessment. He suspects athletes are happier because of the social life inherent in their activity. `` Almost by definition anybody in an athletic group has a group of people they become very good friends with,'' Light said in a recent interview. The seminar is a three-year, $ 350,000 project funded by private, federal and college funds. It involves 90 faculty, administrators and students from Northeastern colleges including <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Among the findings halfway through the project, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> said she chose a joint major in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and peace studies after a friend suggested it fit her personality, said <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION> professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillemar </PERSON>. Another student chose psychobiology the first week of her freshman year because her mother, leafing through a course catalogue, thought it sounded interesting. `` A lot of people feel an improvement in the overall college experience may not come from teaching the subject a tiny bit better but from better advising,'' Light said. The researchers also have found that less than half the female freshmen who entered a science program at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduated in the field, but they are n't sure yet what that means, Light said. `` One interpretation is that is bad _ we're losing talented women,'' he said. `` The other is that's great, they're making choices.'' The researchers will examine 18 separate areas, including the effects of part-time work and extra-curricular activities on student success. And at a time when Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has accused colleges of `` ripping off'' students through poor instruction, the project will look at different methods of instruction, ways to improve student writing and student advisory programs. Researchers expect to issue a report this summer.

 Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has run into roadblocks because key witnesses have refused to cooperate with the probe. Among those who have erected a wall of silence that <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> has been unable to penetrate is a central figure in the probe, longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. The attorney general's former financial manager, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> _ who was introduced to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> _ also is n't talking to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> were indicted in December in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, one of the areas in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been under investigation since last May 11. Former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, another indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, also has also refused to talk to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. The latest figure to stand in the way of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe is <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> oil man <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. Sources familiar with the probe said he decided at the last minute not to give a deposition in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he had agreed to meet with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigators, on questions of whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may have been part of a bribe conspiracy in connection with a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> changed his mind because he was afraid he might not remember everything accurately. Federal prosecutors decided to have criminal charges filed against <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and decided not to grant them immunity from prosecution to compel their testimony. In December, after the three invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he might seek their testimony again after their criminal trial on racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. On Friday, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence to date to warrant indicting <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in connection with a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline plan in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was involved, or a possible conflict of interest involving <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s telephone company stock, a matter in which <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was involved. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he was `` gratified by the action and the statement.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> referred to the independent counsel's investigation as `` an exhaustive process. ... When that particular process is completed I think there will be no doubt in anybody's mind what the facts are and at that time I will rest on that judgment.'' When a reporter pointed out that principals in the investigation were n't talking, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> responded, `` I'm not going to comment on any aspect or details of the inquiry. That's something that will have to be determined by the independent counsel.'' Sources familiar with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe have said that although the special prosecutor has not found sufficient evidence to indict <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he could issue a sharply critical report about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct The grand jury will continue to examine the pipeline and telephone stock matters mostly to tie up `` loose ends,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. If <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> dismisses the grand jury without bringing charges, he could retain his appointment or seek reappointment if new evidence surfaces later, the source said. The grand jury is expected to question <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division during the breakup of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In regard to the pipeline, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>'s lawyer, obtained <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s help in arranging a meeting with then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to help boost the pipeline project. Four months later, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a memo that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said was based on conversations with <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. It said a portion of up to $ 700 million from the oil pipeline would be funneled to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of then-Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. That raised questions of whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who has said he does n't recall reading that portion of the memo, may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act barring bribes to foreign officials Without being able to question <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> or <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is at a dead end. Another part of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe the independent counsel says he has insufficient evidence on which to seek indictment is <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ownership of $ 14,000 in stock in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> was involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stck ownership at a critical juncture. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> as attorney general met with executives of four of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies at a time when he owned the stock. At the time, the Bell companies were seeking to reverse the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s position opposing the Bells' expansion into new areas of business. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ended up approving a reversal of the department's position early in 1987. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he had intended to sell the stock in 1985 but could n't because he had lost the stock certificates. Complicating <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation was the fact that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had signed a transfer of property agreement with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> assigning the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock to the financial manager for more than two years. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> initially listed the stock as having been sold on his financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> got replacement certificates late last summer and finally sold the stock himself after getting <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> to return it to him. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says he considered the transfer agreement a legitimate divestiture of the stock. But <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigators are unable to delve into details of the arrangement because they were unable to question <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>. In December, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he had insufficient evidence at that time to seek an indictment of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal and said he might seek testimony from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> again after their trial. In the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> probe, then-White House counselor <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> interceded on the company's behalf at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s behest to assist the firm in its efforts to obtain a $ 32 million no-bid contract to build small engines for the Army. The company got the contract following a crucial White House meeting called by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s deputy. Three years later, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> set up a financial partnership after <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> _ who at the time was doing work for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and who later sat on the company's board of directors.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> asked Americans on Saturday to pressure President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> into signing comprehensive trade legislation. `` Write the president and tell him ... that this trade bill will help you and help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> feel proud again,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, urged in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio Under a compromise worked out by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators Thursday night, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative would have the authority to impose import curbs on the goods of nations who violate trade agreements. The president could waive the curbs if he thought their cost would outweigh the benefit. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Friday renewed the threat of a veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying the bill unreasonably ties the president's hands and that the administration has `` grave reservations'' about it. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> complained that `` the president has done nothing but cry protectionism and wave his veto pen'' as the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to compete has eroded. `` This is not the time for a veto,'' he said. `` The trade bill is a strong comprehensive bill that helps American workers help themselves.'' He said the Democrats' `` goal has been a bill that the president will sign,'' adding, `` We have extended our hand in cooperation.'' `` The president may not understand what this bill means to the American worker ... I think you do,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said in urging his listeners to write to the White House. The measure also would impose import restrictions to punish <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a subsidiary's role in selling computerized submarine propeller milling equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And, it would require employers to give workers a 60-day notice of plant closings and large layoffs.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio address, delivered Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>: Good afternoon This is Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is putting the finishing touches on a very important trade bill. It is not a minute too soon. Our nation's trade policy is in shambles. You know it. I know it. We import more than we export. We send more of our money overseas than we get back. We are losing American jobs. We are losing our industrial base. We are in hock to foreign lenders. Once it was n't so. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> traded hard all over the world. The result was money in the bank and jobs for American workers. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ran a trade surplus. `` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' was on the product that everybody looked for. Americans took pride in being No. 1. Now our ability to compete is eroding. For seven years the president has refused to act. `` Free trade,'' he says. What about fair trade? The president has done nothing but cry protectionism and wave his veto pen. Yet, unless we change the way <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trades the tide of change will sweep our economic destiny out of our hands. You know what I am talking about. You see it in the frustration of all the young families who can not afford to buy their first home. You understand it when American companies take their jobs overseas. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is rapidly developing a treadmill economy; everyone is working harder just to keep up; yet we still seem to be losing ground to our foreign competition. Our prosperity has always been built on working smarter as well as harder. Yet, despite our new technology and effort to compete, we have been losing the productivity race. For years the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has left trade policy to the whims of the international marketplace and our foreign competition. The administration has refused to act. It has had a do-nothing trade policy. It is time to get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> moving again. The stakes are high and measured in jobs, and in the life style we pass on to our children, and in our vital national security. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will soon send the president a comprehensive trade bill. We are not ready to say good-bye to the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of our dreams. What must be done to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dreams? First, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must boost its exports. Selling more goods overseas lowers the deficit. It is that simple. Our bill gives the president new tools to open new markets for American products. Second, we must take steps to promote <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s long run competitive strengths. We want to see more investment in individuals and in ideas. That means a better educated work force, stronger laws to protect American inventions from piracy by foreign firms. Third, we want to give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry and workers the opportunity to retool and retrain quickly. I have seen the devastating impact in my own state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> where closed factories leave workers and whole communities struggling for their economic future. This trade bill sharply improves the opportunities for workers to retrain, to start new careers. If American workers want to move to expanding parts of the job market they ought to have that chance. Finally, this trade bill would prevent foreign investors from dominating industries vital to our national security. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not control its destiny if our foreign competition is buying up our assets. Opening new markets for exports, giving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry a leg up to retool, creating new opportunities for American workers to retrain, keeping <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s destiny in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hands, educating our children for a prosperous future _ these are the essentials of this trade bill, which the president would veto. In the last few months you have heard a lot of talk about this trade bill from the president. I am sure you will hear more. Our goal has been a bill that the president will sign. We have extended our hand in cooperation. This is not a time for a veto. The trade bill is a strong comprehensive bill that helps American industry and helps American workers help themselves. The president may not understand what this bill means to the American worker, to young families who can not buy their first home, to the unemployed worker who has lost his job to a foreign competitor. I think you do. So write the president. Tell him of your concerns. Let him know that this trade bill will help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> feel proud again. Let's put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future back in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hands.

 An Iraqi pilot held captive by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Saturday he was shocked to learn how many civilians were killed in an Iraqi gas attack on a border town and assumed the raid was a mistake. Air Force Maj. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakr </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON>, 31, said he was shown an Iranian documentary of the aftermath of the raid two weeks ago on the Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` All of us suffer seeing these pictures,'' <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` I ask God to take all of them to paradise.'' <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON> said he was aware that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force had been dropping chemical weapons but added: `` We are under orders. We are officers.'' He said the chemical bombs were dropped to halt Iranian advances into <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied using chemical weapons, which are banned by international law. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it captured large tracts of territory in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in league with Kurdish separatists. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Saturday it routed the attackers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says chemical weapons raids on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, 160 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, killed 5,000 people and wounded another 5,000 on March 16-17. The Iraqi pilot said his Soviet-built Sukhoi Su-22 was shot down 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> on March 18 after the gas attacks were over. He said he earlier had released four conventional-explosive 1,100-pound bombs over uninhabited territory when clouds prevented bombing of a road. <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON> said he ejected and parachuted into Iranian-held territory. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has claimed shooting down more than a dozen <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes since mid-March. The Iraqi officer said he was not involved in the <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> attack. He said he was assigned to drop a chemical bomb into wetland border territory of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in 1983 to prevent an Iranian offensive there. The bomb he dropped then was put on his plane by a crew in civilian clothes who arrived at the air force base with a truck and trailer with civilian plates, <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON> said. He estimated about 50 planes raided <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> from March 16-18 after the Iranians and Kurdish guerrillas captured the town. <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON>, speaking in relatively good English, said he thought the chemical-bomb attack was a `` mistake.'' He said one possible explanation was that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> intelligence did not know the inhabitants were still in the town. <PERSON> Salaleh </PERSON> said he had been well treated since he was captured but had not yet been transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp. He said he had heard on Iraqi television that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has used artillery gas shells but had no confirmation of this, adding that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces had been issued gas masks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has denied using the internationally banned chemical weapons, but has said it has the capability to produce them. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied using the weapons, while coupling its denials with assurances it will use `` all means'' at its disposal to defend its territory.

<HEAD>Sale of Department Store Giant Will Bring Changes to Retail
Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is more than just a retailer changing hands. Analysts fear the $ 6.58 billion deal may lead to more centralization and less innovation in the retail industry. When ownership of the nation's fifth-largest retailer passes to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, the Toronto-based developer will do what it did when it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at the end of 1986: pare the company down, sell its less attractive divisions and keep its most profitable stores. The forecasts are that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, now a collection of diverse department and specialty stores, will become a centralized retailer with few differences among its various units. `` The structure will be much more of a chain store company,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, denied Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would centralize buying operations of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> department store divisions that include <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s in Operations such as distribution will be centralized, he said, but the stores' merchandise mix `` will be determined by the local department store divisions.'' However, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> predicted that under <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> would consolidate operations such as purchasing and marketing that are now carried out separately by the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> units. `` The merchandise will be uniform,'' said <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, who has been tracking the industry for almost 40 years. `` It's bad for the whole industry.'' Retail industry watchers want to see what <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> called `` innovativeness and testing,'' which helps develop new styles and trends. When there are more retailers buying and experimenting, there is a greater opportunity for growth in the retail industry. Friday's announcement of an agreement between <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> ended a grueling takeover battle that began Jan. 25. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> resisted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s overtures for a month, agreed to negotiate with the Canadian company, and then in early March accepted a buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc The wrangling continued for yet another month, until <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> agreed on Friday to bow out. But the New York-based retailer came away from the fight with the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> divisions it wanted most, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and the San Francisco-based <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON> chain. Many retail industry analysts were rooting for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> to win the battle outright. They believed <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> would have re-energized <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s department store divisions in much the way <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> has revitalized its own image in recent years. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, they believed, was interested more in <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s real estate than its retail operations. The stores would give <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> an instant entree into major shopping malls in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The expected sale of several of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s divisions represents a chance for the retailing industry to move in a new direction, but whether that happens depends on who buys the stores. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will retain <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, as well as Tennessee-based <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s and Atlanta-based <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s department stores. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> has already agreed to sell <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s Texas-based <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s and Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s department stores to <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s discount and specialty store chains and its supermarkets divisions are expected to go on the block However, <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said, `` After we comple te our review, we might choose to keep certain divisions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> wants to sell some of the divisions to pay off debt incurred in the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> purchase and to simplify operations, <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said recently that if <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sells <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s units to larger companies _ such as May _ it would continue the trend toward central control and `` sameness.'' However, he said, if the stores are sold to smaller companies or to entrepreneurial management groups, it would mean increased competition, which in turn leads to growth in the retail industry. `` The long-term benefit is to the consumer,'' <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morosky </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> already has received inquiries from retailers, existing management and real estate developers about some of the Federated stores. He said the stores would go on sale several days after the purchase of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> is completed.

 Israeli troops shot and killed six <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters Saturday on the eve of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It was the highest one-day death toll in four months of unrest in the occupied territories. The violence, coming at the beginning of the Jewish Passover holiday, was expected to take its toll on Christian Easter celebrations as well. Church officials have said they expect a severe drop in pilgrims attending the traditional Easter Sunday Mass in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> because of the unrest. Thousands of Christians usually attend the Mass at the 12th-century Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was crucified and resurrected. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, army helicopters buzzed a funeral procession for a slain Palestinian and flew over the site where Chrisitans believe <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born. Since Dec. 8, 133 Palestinians and one <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier have been killed in the violence in the territories occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The most violent clash Saturday took place in the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where the army said a gang of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters hurled knives and metal rods at troops patroling a main street of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. An army spokesman said the protesters tried to seize the soldier's weapons, and troops opened fire to extricate themselves, killing three Arabs and wounding two. One Israeli soldier suffered medium stab wounds and was taken to nearby <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> hospital, the spokesman said. He said another soldier was slightly injured. Troops in the biblical <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> shot and killed a 23-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> during a battle with hundreds of protesters in the winding, cobblestoned streets of the town's main market. Troops also killed a protester in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liqya </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and killed another in nearby <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> al <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> when their patrols came under attack, the army spokesman said. Palestinian reporters identified the dead as <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Assi </PERSON>, 19 from <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liqya </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hamis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, 41, from <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> al <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The army's version of the clash in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> conflicted with reports from <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, who said the violence began when Israelis in civilian clothing got out of two cars and tried to arrest a Palestinian youth. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabagh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, quoted local residents as saying the boy's father attacked the Israelis with an axe, and troops who arrived at the scene killed the father. In the ensuing clash, the boy's uncle was shot and wounded, she said, and two others were killed. Palestinian reporters identified the dead men as <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> al Kourdy, 55, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourdy </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourdy </PERSON>, 21, all members of the same family. There were conflicting reports on the number of wounded protesters. The army reported two wounded by gunfire, but <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalists set the number as high as 13. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a crowd of Easter holiday tourists outside the historic Church of the Nativity watched as a funeral march for <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallas </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON>, the 23-year-old shot earlier Saturday in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, become a defiant anti-Israeli demonstration. After burying <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, about 700 mourners marched back to central Manger Square chanting: `` PLO! <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, no!'' and `` Allah Akhbar'' -LRB- Arabic for `` God is great'' -RRB-. As army helicopters buzzed over the square, the site where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw angry mourners smash the windows of the municipality building. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON>, an electrician, was killed after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops tried to keep a market from opening. Groups of youths attacked the soldiers with rocks and the soldiers responded with bullets, witnesses said. The army spokesman said troops only fired when el <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON> approached them with an object resembling a firebomb. On the 10-foot-wide street where <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaer </PERSON> was shot, the branch of an olive tree had been placed in a puddle of blood. It was accompanied by a sign which read: `` The heroic martyr, <PERSON> Salim </PERSON>.'' The violence came on the eve of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s arrival on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> swing strongly opposed by Palestinian underground leaders, who have accused the secretary of trying to crush their uprising. In the latest underground leaflet, released Thursday, leaders called for a three-day general strike Monday through Wednesday to protest the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> trip. They also ordered riots `` to block <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace plan and stop him from killing the uprising.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biotechnology industry, hailed Saturday by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for its `` promise to revolutionize medicine, agriculture and protection of the environment,'' is seriously hampered by government delays on patent applications, congressional and industry officials say. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in a radio address from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch, called for renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to remain the world's scientific leader, noting that `` over the years, we've secured far more patents than any other country.'' He cited biotechnology as one of the most fertile fields for exploration. For hundreds of small biotech companies developing new drugs, plants and other products through molecular biology, the issuance of a patent can mean instant success. But the wait can take more than four years, leaving some firms to ponder the risk of marketing their products without patent protection. In some of the biotech examining units at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademarks </ORGANIZATION>, `` it takes an average of 27 months just to open an application file, and another 25 months to award or deny a patent,'' complained Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ore </LOCATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee is looking into the problem. Biotech products have begun to pour out of the laboratories of the 12-year-old industry, doubling the backlog of patent applications from 3,903 in 1985 to 7,821 by August of last year. By some estimates, 11,000 applications are now pending. According to industry forecasts, biotech sales in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets will total $ 650 million this year. Barring further bureaucratic snags, the industry projects domestic sales of $ 3.4 billion by 1993 and $ 13.2 billion by 1998. International sales could triple the domestic figure, officials say But `` the longer it takes of patents to be issued, the longer we work in a black hole,'' says <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoemaker </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Centocor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That complaint is echoed by officials of <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>, which has begun marketing a much-acclaimed drug known as TPA _ a clot buster for heart attack victims <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION>'s patent application is still pending, however, and several other companies are planning to market their own TPA drugs. Turnover among biotech patent examiners, lured to private companies by higher pay, has been part of the problem. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said the turnover was 50 percent last year, though the patent office has created 10 new biotech positions for a total of 42, and recently consolidated all those positions within a special biotech unit. Patent Commissioner <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said, meanwhile, that the office is seeking approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> to create special pay rates for the examiners, who usually have a doctorate or master's degree in molecular biology or biochemistry. <PERSON> Quigg </PERSON> said the goal of the patent office is to process all applications within 18 months, but that target likely wo n't be met until 1993 or 1994. To encourage inventions, the Constitution gives inventors the right to a short-term exclusive monopoly on products that result from their new ideas. Currently, the monopoly lasts 17 years. To make sure the invention is indeed new, and not an obvious twist to existing technology, the patent office examines applications in light of previous patents. Lack of patents leads firms to hold their products off the market, or to risk theft of their invention if they sell without full protection. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not publish applications after 18 months, as all other major countries do, the backlog may lead several companies to undertake duplicate research they would not perform if they knew someone else was likely to win a patent. `` Increasing backlogs in the processing of patent applications will have serious deleterious effects on continuing investment and the maintenance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' leadership position,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathmann </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Amgen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in testimony to <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s subcommittee. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Wall Street investment firm, found in a survey of four dozen prospectuses by biotechnology companies that nearly all mentioned uncertainty about patent protection as a potential risk for investors. She gave the subcommittee charts of price movements of several stocks, up when specific patents were awarded and down when patent disputes broke out between two companies. The applications backlog appears to be growing at 20 percent a year, she reported. `` With the lack of clarity of property rights in biotechnology in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many companies are developing similar products _ expending valuable resources, both human and financial _ on me-too programs,'' she said.

 The man who allegedly stabbed two co-workers to death at an archaeological firm and severely wounded two others was a former prison inmate who was apparently hired out of sympathy, police and friends of the victims said. All four victims were `` stabbed with a knife or other sharp instrument,'' police Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He would not say if a weapon had been recovered. The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that the stabbings occurred after the attacker tried to rape one of the women who was killed, but <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> detectives refused to confirm that. Friday's attack occurred in a house where the archaeological firm, <ORGANIZATION> SJS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, examined artifacts. Its excavation was federally mandated as part of a sewer line installation in this <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanyard </PERSON>, 32, who has worked with SJS. <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> identified the dead women as <PERSON> Clarice </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorner </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Annaliese </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Killoran </PERSON>, 22, of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. They were graduate students in anthropology and archaeology. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Conshohocken </LOCATION>, and his pregnant wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, 31, were taken to hospitals. They were working on their doctorates in anthropology at <ORGANIZATION> Bryn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mawr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION>, said college spokeswoman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFarge </PERSON>. Police flooded the wooded area, but failed to find the attacker. Police also closed the Schuylkill Expressway, the state's most congested, for an hour, leading to an accident involving a truck on a side road. Police were looking for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> man described as 40 to 45. WCAU-TV, quoting police sources, reported that <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> was released from prison last October after serving time for attempted rape. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s friends said he often hired former convicts whom he felt needed a second chance. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>'s brother, said he had worked with <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> and others at the site. He described <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> as a former inmate who seemed interested in his job as a digger. `` I just could n't believe it,'' he said. `` I talked to him yesterday. He was a solid worker, he never complained.'' `` Glenn -LRB- <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> -RRB- is on the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> prison board and he got him -LRB- <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> -RRB- from there or the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. `` He had been assured that he had no violent past.'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> is a member of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a prison advocacy group. Telephone calls placed Saturday to the society and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> went unanswered. <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Bryn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mawr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with stab wounds of the legs, arms and abdomen. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> said he was in stable condition Saturday. His wife was in serious but stable condition Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Hahnemann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said. She suffered multiple stab wounds to the back and had internal injuries, but her fetus apparently suffered no trauma, a spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Prof To Meet His Dream Girl: The Voice of the Teller Machine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When he wrote a newspaper column about falling in love with the voice at the automatic teller machine, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferry </PERSON> never imagined he would meet the Scottish woman who recorded the message. But a local newspaper found the woman and arranged for her to come to central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> after editors decided Ferry `` should get to meet his infatuation.'' <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, a 29-year-old <PERSON> Scot </PERSON> who hosts a radio talk show in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, is scheduled to arrive here Wednesday. `` Truthfully it is frightening ... that she will be so disappointed in me,'' said Ferry, an education professor, columnist and happily-married 60-year-old man. `` I think I'm in love with a woman I've never seen,'' Ferry wrote in his Feb. 4 `` Prairie Talk'' column in The <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Review. `` My infatuation is with the talking teller at the Money Network station at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> downtown. `` I imagine I must have a lot of competition, too, from any other guy who is a pushover for her seductive, sophisticated high-English way of saying, ` Please wait while your transaction is processing.''' The unmarried Ms. <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> told the newspaper she was flattered by Ferry's interest. `` I'd be delighted to give him his money personally,'' she said. Her voice, recorded three years ago in <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen because of its `` very soft-spoken Scottish accent, nice and clear,'' said <PERSON> Euan </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> consultant engineer. The story has made a big splash in the British press, which is calling it a `` romantic rendezvous'' triggered by a Scottish accent which is `` driving an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teacher wild,'' the <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> newspaper reported. The <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> paper published the woman's photograph and Ferry, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Millikin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he was n't disappointed. `` She's an absolutely beautiful girl. And I think I really should have my wife along when I meet her,'' he said. Ferry's wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, says she has been teased her about the competition. `` I did n't realize I was going to be face-to-face with her,'' Mrs. Ferry said. `` It's a little unreal. But how would anyone feel if a young sexy person wants to meet your husband. I do n't know what to say.''

<DATELINE>BATTICALOA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight months after they landed to enforce a peace accord between rival ethnic groups, Indian soldiers are chasing a faceless enemy. The Tamil rebels, who have waged a four-year war of guerrilla fighting and terrorism against <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Sinhalese majority, seem to be everywhere and nowhere at once. Every young man is a potential foe, whether dressed in trousers or the plaid sarongs favored in the steamy heat of this tropical island 18 miles off <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s southern coast. Every few miles along potholed roads, <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> soldiers man sandbagged checkpoints where they halt travelers who come on foot, on bicycles and jammed into minibuses. Despite an Indian force estimated at 50,000 by the Indians and as high as 100,000 by Sri Lankan officials, a ragtag band of <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> rebels continues to kill and maim Indian soldiers, massacre Sinhalese villagers and extort money from Tamils, Sinhalese and Moslems alike. The Indians say there are about 2,500 hard-core fighters in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest rebel group. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> claim there are only 175. More than 8,000 Sri Lankans, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed since 1984. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has lost at least 400 soldiers since Oct. 10, 1987, when it launched an offensive to disarm the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. The Indians sent troops to control the rebels as part of a peace plan they sponsored in July 1987. The agreement granted some autonomy to Tamils, but it was rejected by extremists on both sides of the conflict. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s northern neighbor, has a large Tamil minority of its own. Despite <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s firepower, armor, lumbering troop trucks, darting Jeep patrols and helicopters _ and allied government forces _ the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> slip from village to village and even into big towns like <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Arapattai </LOCATION>, 5 miles south of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s eastern coast, Indian soldiers recently checked pedestrians' identity cards and munched snacks purchased in local shops. A five-minute walk away, a man sought by the Indians for harboring Tiger fighters said the rebels could not be vanquished. `` Our fight is reasonable. We must win,'' he said, switching on an electric fan as an elderly relative tended his infant twins. The man asked not to be identified, although the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> know his name and where he lives. They also know that the minute they come after him, his neighbors will sound an alarm and he will slip away _ as he has done several times before _ through the fences of woven palm fronds that make <PERSON> Arapattai </PERSON> look like an impenetrable maze. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are fighting for an autonomous region in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Although Tamils make up only 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, they are a majority in Northern and Eastern provinces. In Eastern Province's <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, the population of about 365,000 is 72 percent Tamil. Sinhalese account for only 3 percent there, while Moslems comprise 25 percent. The Tamils say they have been discriminated against in education, jobs and by a 1956 law that made Sinhalese the official language of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tamils are mainly Hindu, and the Sinhalese are Buddhists. <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION>, population 46,000, is a town of poor fishermen, small shops and many churches, monuments to the missionary efforts of the Dutch, <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> and British colonial eras. The Indian presence keeps armed <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> out of clear sight. But, according to residents who feared for their safety if their names were published, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> make themselves felt in other ways. `` They send notes asking for money. People who refuse are killed,'' a middle-aged Tamil said. `` They have people in the banks, so they know how much money we have.'' But that Tamil, like others who described the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' fund-raising tactics, defended the rebels' cause as a just fight for Tamil rights `` Just because they're militant, they're not unreasonable,'' said one Tamil bureaucrat. A occasional land mine or hand grenade explodes in <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> near a group of the Indian soldiers or the predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lankan police force. Sometimes, the Indian response is disciplined. Other times, it verges on panic, <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> residents said. On March 26, a grenade was thrown at the Sri Lankan police headquarters. No one was hurt by the grenade, but it prompted three hours of gunfire that injured a half-dozen people, including two schoolchildren. Sri Lankan police officers declined to say whether their men fired, but <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> residents said the police apparently started the shooting and the Indians followed with automatic rifle fire. `` The roads were packed with children,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Jesuit from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> who has spent the past 40 years at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION>'s school. `` The schoolchildren just panicked. They dropped their books and bicycles and ran.'' An Indian major, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted that mistakes have been made. `` There is no doubt there is some confusion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Armenian Leader May Have Instigated Disturbances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The disturbances in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> may have been instigated by a local leader who was a target of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s anti-corruption campaign, according to analysts. The local leader may have capitalized on unrest exacerbated by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for economic reform, known as `` perestroika,'' and his allowance of greater public debate of some topics, known as `` glasnost,'' according to a government analyst. Similar disturbances have been reported in each of the 15 republics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And in many instances, the demonstrations grew out of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> resentment of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> efforts to help non-Russians by giving them jobs and raising their living standards, scholar <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goble </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said in an article last year. `` Many Russians came to the conclusion that what had appeared to be reasonable affirmative action for the non-Russians was in fact unreasonable reverse discrimination against themselves,'' <PERSON> Goble </PERSON> wrote. That system worked under the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who tolerated corruption and widespread inefficiency in the economy. Under his leadership, a Russian and a non-Russian were frequently allowed to hold redundant jobs. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his effort to streamline the economy, has stepped on a lot of ethnic toes. `` It is not that he is coming down hard on any ethnic group. It is that he is trying to make the economy more efficient,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. Ostensibly, the demonstrations in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a largely Christian republic, stemmed from Armenian desire to administer the largely Armenian region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which is in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, a predominately Moslem republic. But the unrest began after party newspapers criticized the Armenian party leader, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON>, said an administration source, who like other government analysts interviewed, spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON>, 55, named to his post in 1974, was attacked last June by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who said that reforms were `` stuck in a rut'' in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON> and his underlings showed `` totally unjustified complacency'' toward corruption. Reformers in the <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> attempted to oust <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON> during a meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last December, but were thwarted, according to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a Soviet-watcher based in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. The authoritative <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda hinted strongly of a purge in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` The absolute majority of Armenian working people are honest persons who conscientiously attend their duty, and it is not their fault that the process of democratization and renewal is meeting with fierce resistance of perestroika,'' Pravda said in December. `` People yearn for genuine changes.'' The demonstrations in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> began two months later `` with either the complicity or encouragement of <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON>,'' said a government analyst. `` We believe he backed them, or encouraged them, to warn <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that getting rid of him could cause trouble.'' <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON> has survived the upheaval, although some party leaders in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> have been removed. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efficiency drive has cost local jobs in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, the scene of riots in December 1986. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> abolished the <ORGANIZATION> Kazakhstan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Ferrous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metallurgy </ORGANIZATION>, transferring its functions to a parallel ministry in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but `` throwing a lot of educated Kazakhs out of work,'' said a government analyst. Similarly, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s highly celebrated campaign against alcohol has cost jobs in the vineyards of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, creating tension there, said the analyst. The ethnic unrest has prompted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to announce that he will convene the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the issue at an as yet unannounced date. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> probably will continue to crack down, as he did in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, `` to show people that they ca n't get what they want by going to the streets,'' an analyst said.

 A diesel oil spill floated along about 50 miles of the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Saturday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state officials were searching for the source of the fuel. `` We want to make sure it's not still flowing into the river,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON>. `` We're looking for the source and have teams from <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> making bank searches.'' The oil extended from the area of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> in southeastern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> conservation authorities also helped in the search, <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> added. Barge fleets, towboats and holding tanks along the river were all being checked. <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said the water was too choppy for an attempt to contain the oil slick. The spill apparently caused no serious problem for communities that use the river as a source of drinking water and <PERSON> Mosher </PERSON> said none of them had closed water intake valves. `` We're treating -LRB- the river water -RRB- for some of the byproducts of oil, but the river is relatively warm and it does n't look like it's emulsifying and it looks like it will float past,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, manager of administrative services for the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Shutting down -LRB- intake valves -RRB- is always an alternative to treating, but when you have oil byproducts that will float on top of the water, normally you do n't have that much effect,'' <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said He noted that the intake valves are on the river bottom. <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickerson </PERSON> said the slick was not thick and heavy all the way, but there were traces for the entire distance. Patrolman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said his department began getting reports of a strong diesel smell from the river about 7:30 p.m. Friday, and the spill was discovered after sunup Saturday morning. Officials were unable to say what effect the spill might have on the environment. `` It depends on -LRB- the oil's -RRB- consistency as to whether or not it will threaten wildlife,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We've had no fish kill and have n't observed loss of any marine life,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Henneke </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't anticipate any simply because this appears to be floating. If it does n't settle in, we do n't expect to lose any of our fishery.''

 Riot police fought hundreds of firebomb-throwing radical students Saturday after the police used tear gas to keep the students from marching off a campus. Riot police fired multiple tear gas launchers at about 500 students from a dozen <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> universities when they tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after a pro-labor rally. Students immediately streamed out of the campus and battled riot police for several hours. No serious injuries or arrests were reported. During the rally, student leaders denounced the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> as just another authoritarian regime. They had gathered to show support for workers who want higher wages and more independent unions. Labor disputes have increased sharply since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took office Feb. 25, as have protests by anti-government students. Since his election in December, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has promised to better the lot of workers. But his government has also vowed to deal harshly with violent protests to ensure the country's stability and steady economic development. Violent labor protests battered many South Korean companies last summer following widespread protests that led former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to agree to democratic reforms. Those reforms included the direct elections in which <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was chosen without having won a majority when two rival opposition candidates split the anti-government vote.

<TEXT>
 Members of a Satanic cult have been frightened by the paranoia aroused by rumors that the cult was planning a human sacrifice, authorities say. `` They're keeping kind of low,'' <ORGANIZATION> Magnolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Smithie </PERSON> <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said of the cult members Friday. Terrified parents kept hundreds of students out of schools in the nearby southern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> McComb </PERSON> Thursday as a precaution against a rumored list of potential student victims. But an unidentified source within the group informed police that `` they did n't want to hurt or frighten anyone,'' <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said. Police in <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> reported a quiet evening Thursday, the night, according to rumors, that Satanists were to march down a McComb street before sacrificing a young virgin. `` We did n't receive a single report Thursday night,'' <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said the cult has existed since at least the 1960s and although its members occasionally sacrifice animals, including cats and dogs, they have n't been known to harm people. The midnight meetings are attended by between five and 20 couples, mostly between 17 and 23 years old, and are followed by group sex, <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said the source reported. New members traditionally are recruited by word of mouth and are required to sacrifice an animal, he said. `` I think they're mainly in it for the orgies,'' <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said. Participants may be guilty of cruelty to animals and trespassing, <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> said, but they change their ritual sites and police never know where they will meet. `` Actually, as long as they are peaceful, we'd probably never know what was happening,'' the police chief said. `` Also there's a question of a man having a right to his own worship.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility Saturday for a raid on a large hatchery in what it called an `` Easter liberation for life'' for at least 28 hens. Members of the underground group broke into the <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Egg Ranch in rural <LOCATION> Gilroy </LOCATION> late Friday, stole 28 hens and spraypainted the walls and grounds, said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The underground group said it raided the farm because of alleged `` atrocious conditions'' such as overcrowding and disease, according to <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tannenbaum </PERSON>, president of Action for Animals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tannenbaum </PERSON> said she was asked by the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to speak for them. The group claimed it took more than 78 laying hens, but did not say what it did with them. The raid was the second by the group this Easter season. It also took responsibility for a March 27 raid on a rabbit-breeding company in <LOCATION> Hayward </LOCATION>, where 73 rabbits were taken in protest over the slaughter of rabbits for medical research, furs and meat. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said a book on animal liberation was left behind and that the sheriff's department would increase patrols of the area.

<TEXT>
 Czechoslovak Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> said in an interview published Saturday that the Czechoslovak government lost credibility when it broke up a peaceful demonstration for religious freedom last week. The Roman Catholic cardinal was quoted in the Austrian daily <PERSON> Kurier </PERSON> as saying that the demonstration in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION> March 25 `` was a step towards more religious freedom and the government must take this into account.'' Eyewitnesses estimated about 2,000 Roman Catholics took part in the protest on <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>'s downtown Hviezdoslav Square. Officials said 125 people were arrested and later released. Riot police and water cannons broke up the demonstration, which had been banned in advance. `` The Czechoslovak government, through this measure, lost even more credibility,'' <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> was quoted as saying in early Sunday editions. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, 88, said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is 99 percent laymen. `` It is the duty of the laymen to demonstrate for their rights,'' he was quoted as saying. The Slovak <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda charged Saturday that the organizers of the demonstration were interested in the church and religious freedom `` only as long as they can misuse them politically against the socialist state.'' According to the Czechoslovak state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> which carried parts of the editorial, Pravda said religious activists intended to harm talks between the Czechoslovak leadership and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on filling 10 vacant Bishoprics. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> complained in the Kurier interview that the Czechoslovak delegation which is to travel to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for the next round of negotiations later this month was `` negotiating in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> about us, but without us.'' The paper said Czechoslovak authorities had not allowed him to take part. Austrian Cardinal <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, in a seperate interview with Kurier, praised the strength of religious belief in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. `` What the believers in these countries want _ and the Pope supports them in this _ is not an upset of the political relations, but the possibility as Christians to live their beliefs in a state system which is officially based on atheism,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The former Archbishop of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said he thought Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> in June would be a `` bridge between East and West in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` What the Pope says in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> will also be heard in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and beyond and will be followed with interest,'' <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the Kurier interview. Thousands of Hungarian and Slovene Catholics are expected to come to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to see the Pope.

<TEXT>
 The military rushed extra troops to the presidential palace Saturday and launched a nationwide hunt for the leader of an August coup attempt after he escaped from prison. Military leaders warned that former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who escaped with 14 prison guards and who remains a popular figure in the armed forces, might try to topple the government again. `` If he pursues his attempts to change the government and lead the AFP -LRB- Armed Forces of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> -RRB-, then we will have a problem,'' military spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said Saturday. `` We are asking the support of the citizens to help us. We anticipate they -LRB- the rebels -RRB- will go on with consolidation and propaganda and they will again try to divide the AFP.'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, 39, escaped from a prison ship before dawn Saturday with 14 elite navy personnel who were supposed to be guarding him. He had been confined there since his arrest Dec. 9 for the Aug. 28 attempted coup, which left at least 53 people dead and hundreds wounded. His daring escape was a blow to the prestige of the armed forces, already facing threats from communist and Moslem rebels. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> hurried back to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Saturday after the escape, interrupting an Easter holiday in northern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> for emergency meetings and a nationally televised address. `` I have instructed the chief of staff to issue a warning in unmistakable terms to all military personnel that any assistance given to the renegades will be dealt with promptly and severely with the full force of the law,'' she said in the address. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who had refused to grant amnesty to <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, appealed to the public for help in tracking him down. She said he fled to avoid court-martial for mutiny and sedition, arson, murder and conduct unbecoming an officer. His escape, she added, `` is tantamount to an admission of his guilt.'' Justice Secretary <PERSON> Sedfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> hinted the government would shut down news organizations if it felt their reports in any way helped the rebels' cause. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had given several interviews to local and foreign media before his arrest in a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> fled from the `` <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON>'' prison vessel with a navy lieutenant and 13 enlisted men. The ship was anchored in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> about 500 yards from navy headquarters. They escaped in dinghies that had been sent to the ship to increase security after reports that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> would try to escape. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said loyal guards fired on the fleeing boats but apparently missed. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said the prison ship's captain had been arrested and he and members of his crew would face court-martial for negligence. Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the former colonel was so popular that he had become the dominant figure aboard the vessel which was supposed to be his prison. He remains widely respected in the 160,000-member armed forces even though he has officially been dismissed from the military. Meanwhile, the government rushed to strengthen security in and around the capital Saturday. Trucks and bulldozers blocked entrances to military camps in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and mobile checkpoints were set up on roads leading north. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the military was `` taking every possible action to bring him -LRB- <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> -RRB- back and to minimize or neutralize any further demage that he can make.'' Despite the crisis, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> would go ahead with a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, scheduled to begin April 14. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, a former defense ministry chief of security, played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, civilian-military uprising that toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. But he later accused Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of weak and inept leadership in the face of the communist insurgency. In August, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led 2,000 men in a coup on the presidential palace and seized several media and military installations in the capital. But they were driven off by pro-Aquino forces. It was the most serious of six major plots to unseat Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> escaped and went into hiding before his arrest four months later. The military says 11 officers and 90 enlisted men involved in the coup attempt remain at large. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> had carried out his coup attempt while facing investigation into misappropriation of military equipment. She also said he wanted to avoid a combat command.

<TEXT>
 An Ethiopian rebel group claimed Saturday that it controls the main route for transporting food for millions of Ethiopians facing starvation. <PERSON> Assefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamoa </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the road between the northernmost provinces of <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> `` is only open for humanitarian assistance.'' `` We are calling upon the humanitarian organizations to go on with their operations and the <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> will guarantee their security,'' he said in a telephone call from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mamoa </PERSON> said the front took control of the road Thursday. The rebels' claims could not be verified, but the Soviet-backed Marxist government in the Ethiopian capital, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, has acknowledged the rebels made some advances amid heavy fighting. Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> are the worst-hit areas in a drought that has threatened about 7 million Ethiopians with starvation. Fighting in both regions has disrupted emergency relief efforts. Because of rebel activities, the government often closes roads in the regions, cutting off truck convoys carrying food. Most of the food reaching Tigre comes in by road after being unloaded at the Eritrean port of <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, director of Ethiopian operations for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy used the road Monday to deliver food to the town of <LOCATION> Wukro </LOCATION> and returned along the same road Tuesday. He said both trips were without incident. <PERSON> Mamoa </PERSON> also claimed that government troops on Thursday abandoned the northern Tigre town of <LOCATION> Adigrat </LOCATION>. The front previously announced the capture Thursday of the towns of <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Adowa </LOCATION>. `` The only remaining major areas held by the Ethiopian government are the -LRB- provincial -RRB- capital, <LOCATION> Makelle </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maichew </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mamoa </PERSON> said. `` The situation of the Ethiopian military forces is collapsing.'' Ethiopian President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> said in a radio broadcast Thursday that his troops were fighting `` grim battles'' against secessionist rebels in Tigre and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>. It was a rare acknowledgement. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> inherited the insurgencies 13 years ago when he and a group of fellow army officers dethroned Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and set up a Marxist government. Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war The civil war in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> is in its 14th year.

The 1,000-pound booster piece, about 7 feet square, contained unspent fuel that could have ignited if heated, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargeant </PERSON>, assistant fire chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen identified it as part of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket booster; many such rockets have been launched from the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> complex. The 75-foot <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> II, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Canaveral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafoods </ORGANIZATION>, netted the motor Thursday while scalloping 22 miles east of the port, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosseau </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brosseau </PERSON> said the ship's captain, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, notified the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> of his cargo when he reached port Friday. <PERSON> Sargeant </PERSON> said firefighters had some difficulty clearing the area because few people believed the benign-looking debris was dangerous. `` People just did n't understand what it was they were handling,'' <PERSON> Sargeant </PERSON> said. `` It's non-toxic until it burns. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> ordnance experts trucked the motor to the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, where it will be burned, said Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said the debris was identified as a Castor 4 rocket motor, a solid-fuel booster used primarily on Delta rockets. The booster is manufactured at a plant in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, manager of external affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The propellant, about the consistency of a rubber eraser, will burn, but not explode, if ignited.

<HEAD>Guardsman Faces Court-Martial Over Rolling up Sleeves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A National Guardsman spent a night in jail and faces a court-martial over what he says was his inability to roll up his sleeves because his arms are too big. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a muscular <ORGANIZATION> Escambia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> meter reader in civilian life, was arrested Thursday by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for failing to appear at a Feb. 23 court-martial Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, who will preside over the court-martial, said he does n't think <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is telling everything he did wrong. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is charged with disobeying an order. `` Think to yourself, there's got to be more to it,'' Welsh said. Guard officials `` are n't that thin-skinned.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was released Friday on orders of his battalion commander, said he was told to roll his sleeves up while taking down tents following an exercise last November. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was unable to comply because his arms were too big for his shirtsleeves. He said that a month later he was accused by a lieutenant of willfully disobeying an order and asked if he would voluntarily accept an unspecified punishment. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he refused and asked to speak to a higher authority. He said he did n't hear anything more about it until February when a clerk mentioned a hearing in his case, but he insisted he never received formal notification of the court-martial. The Guard says three registered mail notices were sent to him. `` If they say I got three notices they must have been delivered to the wrong mailbox,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The National Guard should have just given me a phone call to tell me about the court-martial. They've got my number.'' Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, commander of the 417th Signal Battalion, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> failed to go to the post office to pick up the registered letters and that he suspected the part-time soldier knew what was in the envelopes. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> rescheduled the court-martial for May 19.

 Angolan rebels killed 57 government soldiers and shot down a Cuban-piloted helicopter in three attacks last week, the rebels said in a statement issued here Saturday. The National Union for the <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting the communist government with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South African backing, said it killed 51 Angolan soldiers last Sunday in <LOCATION> Tota </LOCATION> in the northern coffee-growing province of <LOCATION> Lunda </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels said they captured 63 Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifles and destroyed three trucks. In another attack, the group said it shot down the Soviet-built MI-28 helicopter, killing its Cuban crew, close to the southern town of <LOCATION> Menongue </LOCATION>. The statement did not say how many Cubans were on board or give the date of the attack. In the third attack, the rebels said they killed six enemy soldiers from an army patrol Monday near the town of <LOCATION> Luma-Kassai </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lunda </LOCATION> province. The statement gave rebel casualties in the attacks as four killed and seven wounded. There was no independent confirmation of the claims. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting since 1975 to force the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-backed government to share power in the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony

<HEAD>Chinese Might Join Foreign Ownersship of California Wineries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If officials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can work out the details, a Chinese-owned winery next year might join the growing lineup of foreign-owned <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wineries. `` So far <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has never had a winery outside of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; we have to make research first,'' <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Song-Quon </PERSON>, chief winemaker of a leading Chinese winery, said Friday through an interpreter. <PERSON> Guo </PERSON>'s place of business is <LOCATION> Tianjin </LOCATION>'s 80,000-case-a-year Heavenly Palace Winery south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Heavenly Palace has been marketing its `` Spring Moon'' brand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since September, mostly in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurants. The wine, a medium-dry, fruity muscat, is the only export label in the Heavenly Palace line. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been making an intensive effort to earn foreign exchange as fast as possible, and a quality <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> winery _ participating in a strong premium wine boom _ would help in that direction. At last count, there were 39 foreign-owned wineries out of about 650 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. If the Chinese join the lineup, their foreign colleagues in this state would include British, five wineries; Canadians, seven; <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>, 11; West Germans, two; Belgians, one; Swiss, five; Spanish, two; Japanese, five; and Thais, 1. <PERSON> Guo </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichang </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior winemaker and a top official of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, has been on a whirlwind tour of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wineries this week, he said in an interview. `` I will make a full report that will go back to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government,'' said <PERSON> Guo </PERSON>, who has visited wineries in the <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and Central valleys. He expressed admiration for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> style of winemaking. Especially under study, said <PERSON> Guo </PERSON>, is the American system of wine-marketing. `` What is marketing?'' he said, expressing the question as a statement. `` In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, we do n't understand marketing ... even bottling ... we have a lot of problems with bottling in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; there is nothing modern like in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. We want <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to follow the American -LRB- wine -RRB- system.'' Through an interpreter, <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> said preliminary plans for Chinese investment in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wine call for an operation independent of the government, with home winery funds and dollars borrowed from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential hopeful <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Saturday blamed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders for the failure of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiatives and said he disagreed strongly with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on policies in the region. Positioning himself for the crucial <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary in two weeks, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said that the question of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland should be resolved in the direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors. `` We will reach out to those on all sides, in all countries, who believe in a future of peace and security,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a major foreign policy speech before about 600 people at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>. `` Negotiations with the Palestinian people are possible. Negotiations with terrorists are not.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been reluctant to point out where he disagrees with rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the issues, but he did so when asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s embrace of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and whether the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are `` morally equivalent. `` I do n't agree with him,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. That relatively mild statement contrasted sharply with Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s denunciation of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s foreign policy ideas in the same area earlier this week. With the speech and a later news conference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was trying to make certain that rival presidential hopeful <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> does not appear more committed to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> than he does _ a key issue with Jewish voters who may make up a quarter of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> electorate. Aides denied the speech was designed to respond to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> but admitted it should blunt the controversy about <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s comments. On another matter, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the full right to defend the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, and that he does not oppose President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s dispatch of more troops there in light of the unrest in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. First on Saturday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned his attention to blue-collar voters in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary on Tuesday. At a labor roundtable in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, his approach was a combination of competence and earthiness. `` My friends, this is not a lot of talk. I know how to do things,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor told the crowd. `` After seven years of charisma, maybe it is time we had a little competence in the White House.'' Twice in his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used an expletive, an unusual action for a politican with a repuation as a controlled technocrat. `` Hell, I'm the only candidate in this race who has ever balanced a budget,'' he said at one point. Then boasting about the benefits of full employment, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added: `` Hell, they are paying six bucks an hour in <ORGANIZATION> McDonalds </ORGANIZATION> in my state, because they ca n't get people. It's a wonderful, wonderful thing. That's the kind of future I want to build for this country.'' In his foreign policy speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touched on a range of issues, but the biggest chunk dealt with the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for a continuation of the Camp David peace process, which he said was the `` unfulfilled'' vision of the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and former Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>. `` Why? Because few <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders have had the courage to see the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> saw it. Few Arab leaders have had the wisdom to choose reconciliation over conflict, to choose hope instead of hate; to prepare for the future rather than relive the wars of the past,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made abundantly clear his commitment to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The first thing anyone must understand about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is that we will never let <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> down,'' he said. `` For decades, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> leaders have know and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have understood, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s fate is our fate ... that our security interests are linked and that our historical and cultural bonds can not and will not broken. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ is a special place.'' After support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laid down three other tenets of his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. The second was the necessity for direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors. Third was a continuation of the Camp David understandings on the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> strip. `` That framework recognizes the right of the people of the territories to shape their own destiny in a way that is consistent with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within safe and security and recognized borders,'' he said. And fourth, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> condemned the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for continuing a major flow of arms into the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sale of medium-range missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not mention his dispute with <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> over a letter 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators signed on March 3, encouraging Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to pursue his peace plan and criticizing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders for not cooperating with the effort. On <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised the progress toward peace in the region, castigating the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for being unable to `` cope with the threat of peace'' there. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also brought up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where he declared the president must `` say ` no' to apartheid; ` no' to racism; `` no to doing business with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Court Chief Says Reforms Caused Increase in White-Collar Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s liberal economic reforms have caused a major increase in economic crimes, debt cases and divorce, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Tianxiang </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, that since a crackdown on white-collar crime began in 1983 about 760,000 people have been sentenced to punishments ranging from a jail term of five years to execution He also said there were 547,000 divorce cases last year, almost half the 1.2 million civil cases heard. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reforms, started in 1976 after the fall of the ultra-leftist <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION>, have loosened state controls over business and opened the nation to foreign influences. But they also have prompted the `` corrupt and ugly'' phenomenon of nouveau riche `` upstarts who use money to seduce or philander with women, and even take concubines,'' <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> said. In addition, bribery, embezzlement and speculation have become commonplace, he said. From August 1983 to the end of 1987, the nation's courts passed judgment on 2 million people for white-collar crime. About 38 percent, or 760,000, received sentences of at least five years in jail, he said. Last year the number of criminals given sentences of 10 years or more for such crimes more than doubled, <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> said, although he did not provide figures. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> said that of the offenders since 1983, government employees made up 15 percent while 28 percent were factory workers. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> did not say how many people were sentenced to die. Foreign analysts have estimated that more than 10,000 people have been executed since 1983, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has never released figures on capital punishment. It is unclear how many people were executed for white-collar crime. <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> said the growth of nongovernmental loans, many without written contracts and with high interest rates, has led to a sharp jump in debt cases. Last year, there were 256,000 cases, eight times the 1983 figure. Divorce cases are also up, he said, partly because women have become more economically independent under the government's reform policies. Some women with greater economic means `` can not bear the bond of arranged marriage or maltreatment by their husband, thus demanding divorces. Their demand is progressive and the people's courts give them full support according to law,'' he said. In a separate speech, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yichen </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procuratorate </ORGANIZATION>, or prosecutor's office, said 1,500 leading officials had been prosecuted over the past five years for such crimes as tax evasion, trademark counterfeits and manufacturing fake and faulty commodities <PERSON> Zheng </PERSON> said the courts continued to deal with cases of people wronged during the leftist anarchy of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He said courts had taken up 789,000 related criminal cases, and new verdicts were given in 286,000 cases.

 An organization of Libyan exiles opposed to <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said Saturday an army officer had defected and denounced `` <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s bloody rule.''

<HEAD>North Dakota Looks For Caretaker For `Lost Bridge'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The 500-foot highway of steel over the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is more than just a bridge to this small village on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. This one possesses personality, they say, so much so they refer to it by name _ Lost Bridge. The 20-foot-wide, three-span truss bridge was erected in 1929 when it only connected two dusty cattle trails, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, assistant bridge engineer for the state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` They built a bridge that had no access to it,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mandaree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Now that state Highway 22 crosses the bridge, the state wants to build a replacement, and <ORGANIZATION> Mandaree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to preserve the old span as a focus for development People old enough to remember its origin are still baffled. `` I do n't even know why they built it,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lone </PERSON> <PERSON> Fight </PERSON> said. Nobody used Lost Bridge before Garrison Dam was built downstream in the 1950s and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sakakawea </LOCATION> blocked many roads, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> recalled. Eventually, Highway 22 became a paved ribbon of asphalt and the bridge, part of the shortest western route around the lake, got far more use. The state wants to replace it with a modern bridge that's 16 feet wider and can carry heavier loads, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said So the state is searching for a buyer for the steel structure and is offering $ 50,000 to aid in moving it. If no one takes the bridge, it will be torn down. <ORGANIZATION> Mandaree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is exploring the possibility of essentially adopting the bridge. The group envisions using it for a fishing site, the focal point of a place for prairie-weary travelers to stop for rest or a picnic, said <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. That would preserve Lost Bridge for its historic and sentimental importance, she said. The bridge sits 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Mandaree </LOCATION> in a picturesque valley of rolling river bluffs that are void of any man-made structures except for the highway itself and an occasional highway sign. Driving into the valley, the sun-drenched metal bridge glistens as it stands against a backdrop of prairie grass. Any group that agrees to preserve the bridge gets at least $ 50,000 _ the estimated expense for tearing it down _ from the state, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. The deadline for assuming ownership of bridge is November, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Mandaree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hopes to make a decision within the next few weeks, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said. `` We are looking right now into the liabilities and what the federal guidelines call for in maintaining a -LRB- historic -RRB- bridge,'' said <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. `` The history is what makes it unique,'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` The fact they call it a lost bridge.'' A new bridge just west of <LOCATION> Lost </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> will cost an estimated $ 1 million, he said. The state hopes to begin construction in 1990. In the early 1970s, the state tried to give away a rainbow-arch bridge over the <LOCATION> Cannonball </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> but found no takers, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> recalled. `` They took a lot of pictures, wrote up quite a documentary on it, and destroyed the bridge,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature blew a small breath of democracy into the government on Saturday by approving a bill that for the first time allows candidates to compete for seats on its standing committee. From now on, the 2,794 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will elect its 155-member standing committee As before, 20 candidates, including the chairman and vice chairmen, will be chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ruling Presidium and elected without opposition, but now 144 candidates will compete for the other 135 seats. Deputies can vote against a candidate or abstain, but the 20 without opposition can be defeated only if they get fewer than half of votes cast. Only two delegates opposed and one abstained in the vote to approve the procedure. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ruled out more than one candidate for such posts as president and vice president, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chairman, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> It said the Presidium will fill those key posts `` in line with the opinions of the majority of deputies.'' The Presidium will also elect the premier, vice premiers, ministers, state councilors and other government officers, with a single candidate for each post submitted by the president. Acting Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> is certain to be formally named head of government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says the current session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been the most open and democratic ever. Official newspapers and national television have spotlighted debate among the delegates and speeches voicing opposition to various policies. Still, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its governing Politburo remain in firm control over decisions of policy and personnel.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Saturday its forces killed thousands of Iranian troops and overran bases of Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels in mountainous northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Iranian warplanes bombed an Iraqi garrison in the region, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news media had no immediate comment on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> victory claim. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces were leveling the Kurdish town of <PERSON> Seyyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> province and its inhabitants were seeking refuge in nearby towns. Kurdish separatist leader <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> confirmed there was heavy fighting and said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` waging a genocide campaign against our people through the daily use of poison gas.'' A tenuous halt in the `` war of the cities'' held as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> continued to silence its long-range missile launchers for the duration of a trip to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not report any attacks on civilian targets either. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> reaffirmed his nation's readiness to continue the halt even after <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, probably Sunday evening, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported But it quoted him as saying the truce would continue only if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted several Iraqi demands, including an Iranian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory, that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly scoffed at. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruler issued a new appeal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to end the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> through negotiations. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio quoted a high command communique as saying Iraqi troops `` completely purged'' the area around <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the last two weeks. <PERSON> Qala </PERSON> <PERSON> Dagh </PERSON> is only 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where Iranian Revolutionary Guards have thrust into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in a 16-day-old offensive. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted its correspondent as saying thousands of Iranians were killed. He did not give figures for casualties among the Kurdish guerrillas. The correspondent also specifically denied a report, carried Friday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, that Kurdish rebels were within five miles of a major highway linking <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> with other <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities. The communique quoted by <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> radio said `` all traitors have finally been destroyed,'' in a reference to the Iranian-backed Kurdish rebels who have been fighting <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for an independent homeland for years. It said an Iraqi force, including Kurdish fighters loyal to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, had overrun 21 Kurdish bases and villages used by the guerrillas in the last few days. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Iranian warplanes bombed an Iraqi garrison at <LOCATION> Shanandari </LOCATION>, in the heart of the area of hostilities, `` inflicting heavy losses and damage.'' <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of one of the two main Kurdish rebel groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, said an Iraqi chemical attack on the village of Seo-o-Saru earlier last week killed 60 Kurdish villagers and wounded 211. `` They are now resorting to a scorched-earth policy, killing defenseless women and children indiscriminately and destroying whole villages,'' he said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that Iranian troops who were nearby heard `` several huge explosions'' coming from <PERSON> Seyyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> on Saturday and `` many buildings in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> town have been demolished.'' It said groups of inhabitants were escaping from the town to nearby towns and villages. <PERSON> Massud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, leader of the other big rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had said several days ago that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army launched a major offensive against the guerrillas March 23. He said two divisions of troops, backed by tanks, artillery and air strikes, were seeking to dislodge rebel fighters and their allies, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, from the <LOCATION> Qara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dagh </LOCATION> mountains between <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> and the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>. An Iraqi division usually numbers about 12,000 men. The villages are north of the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> bridgehead around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Darbandikhan </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims Iraqi chemical bombing attacks March 16-17 on `` liberated'' Kurdish towns killed 5,000 civilians and injured 5,000 more. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ruler, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, said in an address at the inauguration of the sixth conference of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> justice ministers, `` Judging by Islamic and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> history, we find that inter-Islamic wars did not provide any radical solution to problems.'' He called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` to abide by the Islamic teachings, stick to good neighborliness and accept reconciliation and dialogue instead of aggression and the continuation of war and destruction.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>'s peace appeal came only three days after three Iranian gunboats opened fire on a military post on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bubiyan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, wounding two <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> soldiers.

<TEXT>
 The daring prison escape of the leader of the August coup attempt raised new doubts about military leadership under President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. The flight Saturday of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, with 14 prison guards from an elite navy unit, came four days after the military boasted of the arrest of seven top communist rebels. `` How was it possible, because he was on a ship and under guard?'' Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said of the escape. `` How could it happen?'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, 39, served as security chief when <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, now an opposition leader, was minister of defense. Before dawn Saturday, <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> fled the prison ship where he had been held since his capture in December. The 14 officers from the <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION>'s special warfare unit were supposed to be guarding him, but they fled with him. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and the guards escaped under gunfire from other guards and reached shore in two rubber dinghies a few hundred yards from navy headquarters. In what may be worse for the military's image, spokesman Col. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> acknowledged the armed forces learned last week of a possible escape attempt and had doubled the guard force on the ship. The dinghies had come with the increased security. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> announced Saturday that the vessel's commander, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuvilla </PERSON>, had been arrested and may face court-martial for negligence. She also threatened to punish any soldiers who help <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. He and other military dissidents were responsible for six major coup plots against her government. <PERSON> Florendo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was apt to try to organize new plots against the government and to divide the 160,000-member military. The charismatic former colonel remains widely admired in the military even though he was dismissed after his Aug. 28 coup attempt left at least 53 people dead. His escape was widely reported Saturday in the Filipino media, which normally curtail operations on Easter weekend. Scores of callers to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio stations questioned how <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> could have escaped without the help of the guards. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told reporters Saturday he accepted responsibility for the escape but would let Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> decide whether he should be relieved. `` Somehow, in one way or another, I bear responsibility for ensuring that our detainees are secured and procedures are followed,'' he said. Last month, the congressional Commission on Appointments approved de Villa's nomination as chief of staff. The move came despite opposition from some congressmen who felt the former Constabulary commander should have retired instead. Critics said extending his tour of duty limited promotion of younger officers and smacked of practices under ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The escape also raised doubts whether the congressional commission would approve the recent nomination of Adm. <PERSON> Carlito </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunanan </PERSON>, former chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, as navy commander. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they already had misgivings about <PERSON> Cunanan </PERSON> because of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s inept handling of rescue efforts in a December collision of a Filipino passenger ship and oil tanker that killed 3,000 people. The escape took place as the military was enjoying new prestige for Tuesday's arrest of seven leading communists, including <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, commander of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> had said the arrests showed that the military had overcome past divisions and could now act effectively. But on Saturday, he called the escape `` disturbing news.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said the search for <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, moreover, would divert military resources from the fight against the rebels. One Filipino politician also worried about the international impact of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s escape. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Osmena </PERSON> said it was bound to tarnish the government's image abroad and raise more doubts about the stability of the Aquino administration.

<HEAD>Thousands Join in annual Easter marches against nuclear weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of West Germans joined Saturday in the annual Easter weekend marches to demand the elimination of all nuclear weapons and the closure of nuclear power plants. Organizers said marches were held in all of the nation's major cities and there also were vigils near the sites where two jet fighters of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s allies crashed last week. No estimate of the number of people participating in the marches was given. Police reported the demonstrations were peaceful. A French Mirage jet crashed Wednesday within a mile of a nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> state, killing the pilot. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 fighter crashed into the small town of <LOCATION> Forst </LOCATION> on Thursday and the pilot and a resident were killed. The F-16 went down about eight miles from a nuclear power station. Officials said such crashes posed no danger of an accident at nuclear power facilities because thick concrete domes shield the reactors. March organizers said more anti-nuclear demonstrations will be held Sunday.

 If fallen evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> fails to quickly reverse his defiance and accept a year-long bar on preaching and television appearances demanded by the Assemblies of God, the church will move to dismiss him, officials say. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, whose worldwide ministry is scrambling to overcome financial problems, has said he will defy the church order and preach again on May 22, only three months after he confessed to unspecified sins. A rift between the church's leaders over how to discipline <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was settled Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> announced it would not contest stern sanctions ordered by the Assemblies' General Presbytery. The church's General Presbytery, meeting at its national headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday banned <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> from the pulpit for at least a year for `` moral failure'' that reportedly included hiring a prostitute to pose nude. On Friday, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> church officials said they would go along with the order despite their own recommendation that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> be barred from preaching for only three months. `` I would hope he would see the wisdom of submitting himself to the judgment of his brothers because there is a strong desire ... to be helpful to the man,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, the Assemblies' retired general superintendent. On Feb. 21, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> tearfully confessed to unspecified sins and stepped down from the pulpit. On Wednesday, he announced through his attorney that he would return to the pulpit May 22 _ the end of the three-month suspension recommended by the state council _ in defiance of the national leadership. `` What was said at the Wednesday press conference still holds,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said Friday. `` Reverend <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> is still planning to return to the pulpit May 22 and we're still examining the rights to appeal.'' Church bylaws, however, do not allow ministers to appeal rehabilitation decisions, said <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the Assemblies' national headquarters. `` If they have n't heard from him -LRB- <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> -RRB- in a few days, a reasonable period of time, they'll assume he is rejecting their offer. In that case, they would move immediately to dismiss him,'' she said. The national office expected to hear from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> on Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry is not controlled by the Assemblies of God. Officials have said the credentials of the organization's ministers are the only direct link with the Assemblies, the nation's largest Pentecostal denomination. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Treeby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s lawyer, said lack of denomination credentials would not affect the ministry's operations. Television appears to be the lifeline for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry, which includes worldwide missionary and hospital programs, a Bible college and a worship center that seats 5,000. Ratings from the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s average viewership dropped from more than 1 million households in November 1986 to 860,000 homes a year later as he lost his position as the most-watched TV preacher. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry conducted a telethon in mid-March in which the evangelist's wife <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> warned that many programs faced cancellation. Ministry officials have refused to reveal how much money was raised through the telethon. The March issue of the ministry's magazine, The Evangelist, said the organization faced a $ 14.7 million deficit through February, before the sex scandal surfaced. The magazine's April edition was about half the size of those published in previous months. The ministry's bank account was overdrawn by $ 2 million, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in a March 19 appeal for funds sent to supporters. The organization recently mortgaged more than 100 acres of property to cover a suspended connstruction project and to secure a $ 20 million line of credit. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry has contributed between $ 10.3 million and $ 11.4 million annually over the past three years to the Assemblies' foreign missions program, <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said `` There have been indications that a number of people sending money to individual organizations ... will now send through the church where there is accountability and they know what the money is used for,'' she said.

<HEAD>Poll: Dukakis Holds Small Lead Over Jackson In Wisconsin</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a narrow lead over the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the week leading up to Tuesday's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> presidential primary, according to a newspaper poll published Sunday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among voters who said they would vote for, or leaned toward, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate if the primary had been held at the time of the poll, The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. In a poll two weeks earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by 38 percent to 30 percent, the newspaper reported. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, made the largest gain in the two-week period between polls, increasing his support from 10 percent to 15 percent, the newspaper said. Despite campaigning heavily in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> slipped from 11 percent support to 5 percent in the two weeks, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> has pinned his fading presidential prospects on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, hoping that a victory in the primary would give him a boost going into next week's primary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On the Republican side, the poll showed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would easily defeat his remaining primary challenger, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> but might have a difficult time winning <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in the general election if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were the Democratic nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held an 80 percent to 7 percent lead over <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the poll showed. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended in a virtual tie among voters who were asked which of the two they would likely vote for in the general election in November. In similar matchups, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held a 5 point lead over <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and a 14 point lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the newspaper said. The poll was conducted Wednesday and Thursday and was based on interviews with 845 randomly-selected <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> adults who said they were absolutely or fairly certain to vote in the primary, the newspaper said. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary is expected to draw a large voter turnout with as many as 1.6 million voters or 45 percent of the eligible voters participating, state <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<HEAD>Impeachment Verdict Won't End Arizona's Legal Morass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This week's expected verdict in Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment trial wo n't necessarily end the legal morass that surrounds the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governorship. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plans to vote Monday or Tuesday on whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a first-term Republican, should be the first <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor removed from office. Senators heard five weeks of testimony on allegations that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> misused $ 80,000 in state money by loaning it to his auto dealership, and that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official. With 20 of the 30 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes required for conviction, nobody is predicting what will happen. If he is acquitted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will automatically regain the gubernatorial powers he gave up to Acting Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, when he was impeached by the House Feb. 5. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicts him on either count, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> will be removed from office immediately. In either event, the matter wo n't necessarily end there. If acquitted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> faces two more battles to keep the governorship. A criminal trial is due to start April 21 on a charge similar to one impeachment charge the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped: failure to report a $ 350,000 campaign loan. The governor faces six felony counts of fraud, perjury and filing false documents, and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, faces three similar counts. Senators who voted to drop the impeachment count said they feared that if they heard evidence on the charge it would jeopardize <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s right to a fair trial. If convicted in the criminal trial, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would be removed from office automatically and could face up to 22 years in prison. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also is running against six candidates in a recall election May 17. Polls vary widely, with some showing him far behind but one putting <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and Mrs. Mofford in a dead heat for first place. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes to oust him, the governor and his defense attorney, <PERSON> Jerris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, say they could appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on grounds that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s constitutional rights were violated. It's also unclear whether the May 17 recall must be held if the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicts <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on the impeachment charges. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a Republican, said Friday he believes the recall still must be held because the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> says a recall is aimed at the office, not the officeholder. However, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said he philosophically opposes holding the recall if <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has already been removed. `` I do n't think our founding fathers who drafted the Constitution ever dreamed we would be in this position,'' he said. This and other remaining legal questions should be settled in court, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said. If the recall were to go ahead following a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conviction, officials say it's also unclear whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would be allowed to run. He has an automatic spot on the ballot, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law school, argues that a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to remove him would apply to the entire four-year term and he could not remain in office even if he won the recall vote. Legal questions surround Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s gubernatorial candidacy too. A campaign was formed to draft her because <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s `` resign to run'' law apparently would require her to quit as acting governor and secretary of state if she declared her candidacy. A court challenge has been mounted to see if the Mofford draft campaign was handled properly, without any involvement by the intended candidate. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said his office warned years ago that the laws were unclear and should be straightened out, `` and nobody has, so here we are.''

<TEXT>
 While suds, sun and sin may prevail among much of the spring break throngs on the wide beaches of <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> this Easter weekend, morning devotions replace hangovers in at least three beach hotels. <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has become a mecca for spring break in recent years, and an estimated 500,000 students descend on the area to forget classwork and laze in the sun. But it's not all rowdy parties and promiscuity. At the beachfront <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, students carry Bibles through the lobby. The hotel caters to members of the Campus Crusade for Christ, a national interdenominational group. `` You can only get so drunk and sunburned and bored,'' said <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, director of Operation Sonshine of the Campus Crusade. `` A lot of them want to know more about Christ.'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, whose organization has conducted conferences for some 3,000 students during spring break, said Campus Crusade members take their Gospel message to the beach in the afternoons and that sun worshipers are often receptive. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Caribe </PERSON> does not allow unchaperoned non-member students under 21 to rent rooms during spring break. `` The difference is day and night,'' said <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribe </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, explaining how students in her hotel act compared with students staying at the dozens of other beach hotels. Ms. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the biggest problem in her hotel is minor noise making, and that the students are generally well-behaved and polite. The situation was much the same at The Desert Inn and the High Seas Motel, also spring break gathering places for Campus Crusade members. `` There was no muss, no fuss and no beer-bottle throwing,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Madorsky </PERSON>, a part-owner of the Desert Inn, the Voyager and Americana hotels. Many of the crowds at <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> used to go to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> before that community began to try to change its image with stricter law enforcement. Officials in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> have estimated their crowds will range between 100,000 and 200,000 this year, compared with 350,000 in 1985. <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> officials say this spring break, students generally have behaved better than in the past, when hotel guests tossed such objects as unopened beer cans, room chairs and even rollaway beds from balconies. So far this year, there have been two spring break fatalities in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, one a 24-year-old man, not a student, who fell from a balcony, the other a 21-year-old student who was hit by a car. There were five other balcony falls this year in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION>, but only two of the six involved students and most resulted in only minor injuries. In the past three years, six deaths have resulted from balcony accidents. In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, two spring break visitors were hospitalized after balcony falls Friday in <LOCATION> Destin </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> resort town. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, fell while doing pullups from a fifth-floor balcony railing, authorities said. He was listed in guarded condition at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, 18, of <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who fell three floors, was in stable condition at the same hospital. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mid-Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said some 500,000 students have come to <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> for spring break this year and 330,000 will have lodged in a hotel for an average stay of about five days. She predicted that each student spends an average of $ 375, not including transportation, for a direct-dollar impact of $ 123.7 million on the <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> economy.

<HEAD>Panama's Easter Joy Dampened by Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Recasts 2d graf to clarify that packets contained incense</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The incense vendor accepted a poor woman's coins and spooned tiny measures of powdered red sandalwood, honey-crystal myrrh and dried rosemary into scraps of paper. `` Thirty cents,'' lamented <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, appraising the three dimes paid for the incense. `` This is the worst year ever.'' The tall, ebony-skinned man, who peddles crosses and other piety objects, said he has sold only a $ 1 portrait of Jesus Christ since midweek. Holy Week is usually the best time of year for <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> and the small business he runs from a rickety stand in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral. Indeed, the Easter holiday usually brings joy throughout this country where about 95 percent of 2.2 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. But an economic and social crisis over the rule of military chief Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has cast a pall over this year's celebration Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under drug-trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has moved to consolidate control despite increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on him to step down and leave the country. He closed banks a month ago to prevent a cash panic after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> froze Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The government has failed to pay most of its 130,000 workers, and private employees have nowhere to cash their checks. The money crisis worsened nationwide hunger and unemployment. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been stepping up its military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, though administration officials say they do n't intend to use force to oust the strongman they once backed Another 1,300 military personnel will arrive Tuesday, bringing to nearly 12,000 the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops there. The administration says the troops are intended to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and 45,000 Americans living in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Never have we Panamanians lived a Lent with such tension, division and increasing want in great sectors of the country,'' said a Catholic church statement. `` The people suffer and await the Feast of the Resurrection, that it may signal some light of hope.'' Few Panamanians saw cause for optimism. The church said Saturday that opposition leaders had accepted a church role as mediator in the country's travail. But the opposition continued to demand that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leave the country, something he has doggedly refused to do. Many people in the streets expressed despair over unremitting price increases and hunger. Fresh fish, a typical Easter meal in years past, has risen beyond modest means in this isthmus between the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans. Many hunkered down in the capital of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, forgoing customary visits with family in the provinces to protect diminishing savings. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> said outbound traffic through <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorrera </LOCATION>, the main gate to the countryside, was extremely light all week. External calm replaced weeks of political activity and demonstrations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police replaced the heavily armed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> soldiers on the street Friday for the first time since an unsuccessful March 16 coup attempt against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Five men conversed on 17th Street downtown. Two sat on a workshop bench carried out to the sidewalk and three others stood while all sipped a mixture of rum, milk and ice from paper cups. `` None of us would be here now if it were n't for the crisis,'' said a man in a sleeveless T-shirt and shorts. `` We'd be in <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION> where it's cool.'' The mountainous western province is a favorite tourist spot in better times. `` So our recreation is conversation and a couple drinks,'' said another in a blue `` guayabera,'' the loose-fitting tropical shirt. Inevitably, talk turned to the crisis. All five said they opposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. One suggested that `` out of the 2 million Panamanians, 200 support him.'' Because of fear of reprisals, none wanted his name published. Some of the men also talked bitterly of how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions were making their holiday and their lives difficult. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been a good friend to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for more than 80 years,'' said one. `` And it hurts more to be wounded by a friend.'' And all doubted that the population, stymied by government repression, could do much to change things after the holiday.

 The families of six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scuba divers arrested in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> nearly two weeks ago say they are still anxiously awaiting word on whether the men will be charged with crimes for allegedly entering restricted waters. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> authorities suspect the six were seeking valuables from a Dutch ship that sank more than 200 years ago, according to <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuven </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Our lives are at a standstill.

In addition to the six Californians, three Australians, a Briton and an Iranian were also aboard the <LOCATION> Budi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indah </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Meldrum </PERSON>, an Australian Embassy spokeswoman. The divers are being held until the investigation is completed. Sophisticated sonar equipment found on the boat added to authorities' suspicion about the group, Ms. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuven </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, an American vice-consul in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Medan </LOCATION>, said the detained Americans contended they were in international waters. `` As of yet there have been no formal charges filed against the divers,'' Ms. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heuven </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` They are in good condition and have no complaints about maltreatment,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Alleckson </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy spokesman in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. Mrs. Craft said <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> officials have told her the country does not hold a person for more than 20 days without bringing formal charges. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Australian embassy officials said last week they were still trying to establish the facts surrounding the incident.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is trying to get this city's interim police chief ousted, saying he unfairly charged a service station owner with illegal possession of a handgun after a robbery. In a letter mailed to <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> members here Friday, one of the organization's national directors asks for help in keeping <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON> `` from bringing his campaign against law-abiding gun owners to <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>.'' The letter told members they should to voice their opposition Tuesday when city commissioners meet to consider permanently appointing <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON> as chief. In question is <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>'s enforcement of an anti-gun ordinance while he was police chief in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. An April 1984 measure banned possession of a handgun within the city limits `` I find it very ironic that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> in effect is criticizing me for obeying the law and being accountable to the people who make the law,'' <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON> said Friday. <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police charged service station owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> with violating the ordinance when, following a robbery at his station in 1986, he chased the suspects and fired at them with a .45 - caliber pistol, <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> ultimately was acquitted. `` The police department and their attorneys spent all of their efforts in prosecuting <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and there was never an attempt to find the robbers,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattanzio </PERSON>, the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official who wrote the letter. `` They were trying to prosecute a man who tried to use a weapon in self-defense.'' <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in October 1987, denied the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> accusations. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has filed a federal lawsuit naming <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, two <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police officers and another city official and seeking more than $ 2 million in compensatory damages and $ 1 million in punitive damages from each defendant.

<HEAD>Florist Says He May Halt Live Easter Bunny Display</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 60-year-old Easter tradition _ a sidewalk display of live Easter bunnies _ may bow to protests and be gone next year, the florist who sets it up said Saturday. `` It will be determined by the public. If they want us to have the rabbits next year, we suggest that they write in to us,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON>, owner of Scheinuk The Florist. He said he wanted tangible support for the display, not just comments from people who walk into the store. `` Just to come here and say, ` I was here as a young kid and now I'm bringing my grandchildren,' without bringing some moral support _ you ... get a little disgusted.'' The fenced-in display, in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble buildings along <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ave. </LOCATION>, opens 10 days before Easter and lasts until Easter Sunday. <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said thousands of adults and children come to look at the rabbits every year. Some buy them for $ 10.90 each _ a price at which <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said he makes no profit. For the past several years, the display also has attracted pickets, people who say selling live rabbits for Easter gifts amounts to animal cruelty because the bunnies all too often wind up at animal shelters. `` We suggested to them they would do beter telling unwed mothers how to take care of their children,'' <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON> said. To add injury to insult, 15 rabbits were stolen late Thursday or early Friday by someone who cut an 8-inch-square hole in the chain-link cage. `` In this weather that we've had, these flooded conditions, police have too much to do than to fool with rabbit stealers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Defendants in white robes waited in cages in a makeshift courtroom as the trial began Saturday for the 33 Moslem fundamentalists accused of using terror to disrupt the government. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 15 defendants, two of whom remain at large, for allegedly trying to kill two former government ministers and a magazine editor. They are seeking penalties for the others of up to life in prison. The defendants pleaded innocent and said they were tortured and abused by state security policemen and prosecutors during questioning. The prosecution denied the allegations. The 15 facing possible death sentences are charged with forming an illegal organization called `` Salvation from Hell'' with the intent of destabilizing the government through assassinations and other attacks. They are charged with the attempted murders last year of former interior ministers <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Basha </PERSON> on May 6 and el-Nabawi <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> on Aug. 13, and magazine editor <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> on June 4. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Basha </PERSON> was wounded seriously, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> sustained a minor hand wound and <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> was not injured. All of the defendants are accused of illegally possessing firearms, explosives and pamphlets that contained information designed to incite anti-government violence. Security was strong outside the courtroom, with at least four armored personnel carriers and scores of armed soldiers present. The 4 -LCB- - hour session before chief Judge <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Oteify </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and two fellow judges dealt mainly with procedural matters The 31 defendants in custody sat or stood in three cages in the courtroom, a renovated exhibition hall. White banners hanging on the cages' iron bars proclaimed `` The Moslems Are Coming'' and `` Prison and Execution Wo n't Move Us Away from Islam.'' The defendants chanted similar slogans. Attorney <PERSON> Abdel-Halim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandour </PERSON>, speaking for the group of 47 defense lawyers, told the court that police fabricated evidence against the defendants. `` There is no illegal organization. This is a fabrication from the state security,'' <PERSON> Mandour </PERSON> said. `` It is an attempt by these people to strike against Islam and religious men.''

 A developer who is buying a marine laboratory in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says he plans to build a resort but also hopes to preserve the research facility. <PERSON> Henk </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastenbroek </PERSON>, who has developed several time-share vacation properties in the Keys, agreed to pay $ 700,000 for the 7 -LCB- - acre Sea World Marine Science and Conservation Center, the only operating facility of its kind in the country An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> said the marine laboratory was unique because of its access to tropical waters. The lab is being sold by the book publishing company <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been under pressure to sell real estate and other assets to repay creditors after fending off a hostile takeover bid last year. The marine lab was used to collect sharks and tropical fish for <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s Sea World theme parks. The company had agreed to sell the laboratory to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the state university system, but the deal fell through when the <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> realized there was no guarantee that the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would allocate money for the purchase, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mastenbroek </PERSON> agreed to pay the same price the state would have paid He said although he planned to build a resort on the site, he hoped he could maintain the lab, built in 1978, The <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions. An administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> said she doubted that the marine laboratory would remain intact. `` Our problem is they -LRB- the developers -RRB- keep saying they have to make money out of it, which is n't too likely,'' <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargo </PERSON>, a project coordinator at the institute. `` I've seen too many research facilities and they're not money makers.'' Three years ago, the institute contracted with <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION> to use the marine center for its own research.

Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> is growing 10,000 conchs there to determine whether they can be grown to reseed depleted conch beds.

Tornadoes caused scattered damage in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> early Saturday after hitting four towns in eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Friday. `` We had wave after wave of thunderstorms move into this area during the night,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Koziara </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` They raked it hour after hour after hour after hour.'' Snow and blowing snow continued to bedevil travelers in southeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, where wind gusted to 40 mph, and many roads were closed in the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where 12-foot snowdrifts were reported. `` We're snowed in _ we're out of electricity and can hardly move,'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Elkhart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said Saturday morning. Power was restored before noon to the town in southwestern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, by a utility crew that came by helicopter. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was hit hard Saturday. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, about 200 people had to leave their homes. A tornado damaged 30 to 40 houses and 20 businesses in <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION> and neighboring parts of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tammany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, where fallen trees left many subdivisions without power into the afternoon. Only 10 to 20 houses were flooded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> itself, but bags of trash left out for garbage pickup floated down <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> while cars drove along the raised streetcar tracks in the median. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gretna </LOCATION>, on the west bank of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, both got 8 inches of rain in 12 hours, with more expected, the weather service said. One woman drowned early Saturday in <LOCATION> Marrero </LOCATION> when she turned off a flooded street and drove into a drainage canal, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortunato </PERSON> of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's office. Flood crests were forecast from Sunday into Wednesday along many rivers in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Water also flowed into dozens of homes Saturday in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, officials reported. Civil defense director <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON> said 4.2 inches of rain fell on <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from midnight to noon Saturday, and that the flooding was not from streams but from water standing on already saturated ground. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> had both floods and snow, from 23 inches of snow in the Panhandle to 4 feet of water in streets in <LOCATION> Skiatook </LOCATION>, in the northeastern part of the state. Skiatook fire officials said about 30 homes were evacuated and more than 15 businesses were shut down after <LOCATION> Bird </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> overflowed. The water began to recede Saturday afternoon, said Fire Capt. <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. One Skiatook resident, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>, 88, rejected pleas from neighbors to move to higher ground because of his dog, <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON>. `` No one would want to let him in their house,'' <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Blackie </PERSON> would n't like getting out in the water. `` This water bothers me, but it do n't bother me bad.'' In the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>, `` We're just now starting to open some roads back up,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, a communications officer at the state <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. He said all but two highways in <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> counties were closed during the morning. In the west-central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, 105 travelers stranded by highway closings spent the night in the high school gymnasium after the town's motels filled up, said a police dispatcher who would n't give her name. Those travelers left when roads were reopened Saturday morning. But Interstate 70 from <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Limon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, remained closed by dusk Saturday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> shut down a 100-mile stretch of the interstate's west-bound lanes, from <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION> to WaKeeny, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, after motels in <LOCATION> Goodland </LOCATION> filled to capacity late Saturday afternoon. In the adjacent southeastern corner of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, 20 inches of snow had fallen at <LOCATION> Walsh </LOCATION> with 16 inches at <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. The weather service said snowdrifts stood 4 to 5 feet high in the area. In nearby <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, where 8 to 10 inches of snow fell, travelers resumed their journeys Saturday after spending the night stranded in the town. About 140 people took shelter at the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> when motels filled up, carloads of people went to other churches and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION>, and 65 stayed at the Fire Department. In <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, up to 100,000 customers lost power for a time Friday when up to a foot of heavy snow downed power lines. In <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, about seven families moved out of their homes Friday night because of rising water. `` They're kind of used to it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarkson </PERSON>. `` They just kind of put things up high on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''

 Democratic presidential hopefuls <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned Saturday for momentum and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> fought for survival in this week's <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary, as the state reclaimed its historic role as a decisive crossroad on the long nomination trail. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are locked in a close <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> contest whose outcome could label one the front-runner in the 1988 race. Both men were in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on Saturday, preparing for <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses Monday that will set the stage for the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> balloting Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, delivering a major foreign policy speech Saturday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION>, offered strong support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while blaming <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders for the failure to achieve peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At a news conference later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he disagreed with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s embrace of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and his position that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are moral equivalents. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was campaigning near <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, kept his attack on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which he said has `` the most indictments, the most corruption, the highest sleaze factor in the history of American government. we deserve better government _ we deserve honorable leaders.'' In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, both candidates have laid down a clear appeal to the blue-collar workers who are critical to Democratic success in the state. `` I have argued your case. I've stood with you and with the working people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowd at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> late Friday. `` And now I want you to stand with me.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned his fire on the coporations. `` If we're serious about winning the battle for our economic future, we've got to get control of the merger and acquisition binge that's ... leaving the average working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> holding the bag,'' he said in <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>. The two other Democrats _ Sens. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> _ ignored <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in favor of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The latest poll, published Sunday in the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, showed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a 43 percent to 35 percent lead over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> among voters who said they would vote for, or leaned toward, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> received 15 percent and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> was fourth with 5 percent. The poll, conducted last Wednesday and Thursday among 845 likely voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. `` This is the most important primary vote we have had since 1960 because of the closeness of the race.'' said <PERSON> Suellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrats. `` This is our moment in the sun.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> put the rest of his chips on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, playing for an upset that would keep his hopes alive. The polls suggested his effort could end next week. `` Not since 1960 has <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> had a chance to say in such concrete terms: We want a basic change,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told a crowd in Madison last week. In 1960, then-Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> upset Sen. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary and took a big step toward the White House <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is making a major effort in the state with hard campaigning and a big investment in television ads. A surpising showing in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> could be a big boost for what <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> has set as his pivotal contest two weeks hence, in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. The Republican primary in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is drawing little attention since Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dropped his bid last week, leaving the nomination wrapped up for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. There are 47 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates at stake. The lack of a Republican race adds uncertainty for the Democrats, since the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> open primary law allows <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faithful to vote in the still-disputed Democratic race. `` I'd welcome any Republican into the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who wants to vote for any candidate we have, if the vote is given sincerely,'' Ms. <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON> said. `` This is the very nightmare that we had with the national party four years ago,'' While academic experts say crossover voters have never made the difference between winning and losing, Democrats were upset when Republican Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said last week he would vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> if he were a Democrat. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> later said he was not trying to encourage crossover voting. In the delegate race, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a narrow margin _ 653.55 to 646.55 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> held 381.8 votes and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 169.5. A total of 468.6 votes are uncommitted. At the July convention, 2,082 votes are needed to win the nomination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got a three-delegate boost Saturday wehn he swept the party caucuses in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Party vice chairman <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got 634 votes while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailed with only 37 votes. They were the only two candidates on the caucus ballot. Six people, who each will cast one-half vote as delegates to the Democratic National Convention, were chosen in Saturday's caucuses in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> primary offers 88 Democratic delegates, but that is not the big prize. The winner in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has the chance to start momentum for a five-week stretch of big-state primaries that could decide the nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is looking for a big-state win to get his campaign back on track after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> derailed it with a win on March 26 in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> precinct caucuses. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has started to retool his campaign style, unveiling a new speech in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> Thursday night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, sometimes called a cold technocrat, admitted that he will never be the `` Great Communicator'' in the mold of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but what he called a `` Great Builder.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is looking to keep on winning, particularly in a state where his base _ black Democrats _ is so small. Less than 4 percent of the state's population is black. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has made a major effort to reach out to blue-collar workers and farmers _ and has drawn dramatically large and enthusiastic crowds in that effort. `` He's one of us, not a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> big-wig,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittman </PERSON> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> as he attended a big farm rally for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the northern dairy country. A poll published in this week's editions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News & amp; World Report said that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> became <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vice presidential running mate, the Democrats could defeat the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, regardless of who became <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. A Dukakis-Jackson ticket was supported by 47 percent of the 1,004 people contacted last week by telephone for the poll, while a hypothetical <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Illinois Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> would win 42 percent. The poll, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

 Flickering lights from thousands of candles illuminated <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION>'s Basilica late Saturday as Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> followed a procession of cardinals and bishops in ceremonies to usher in Easter. A two-hour vigil on the eve of Christianity's holiest day of the year culminated with a midnight Mass celebrating the resurrection of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. Thousands of people packed into the pews and aisles lit small candles as the silent procession moved through the cavernous church. The pope carried a long white candle as he walked to the main altar under the `` Baldacchino,'' the baroque canopy designed by the 17th century sculptor and architect <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernini </PERSON>. The pontiff's candle was lit from a large Easter candle in an act that symbolizes the light of Christ. The `` Lumen Christi,'' or Light of Christ, was chanted three times as the pope reached the main altar. After the third time, the lights of the Basilica suddenly came on. `` During this night of vigil we are baptized in the death of Christ. We are buried together with him in death, so that we may walk in a new life, like <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said in his homily delivered in Italian. After the homily, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> baptized and confirmed 27 people from 11 countries. They youngest was a 7-year-old boy from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Asmathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristofanilli </PERSON>, and the oldest was <PERSON> Joana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Evora </PERSON>, 49, from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. The only American in the group was <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, 19, a baskeball player at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Via you I send my greeting to your respective countries: <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told them. `` Coming from different parts of the world you symbolize the universality of the church, the universality of redemption.'' In his homily, the pontiff said `` this night of vigil invites us to the greatest joy, the joy of the Easter of Christ.'' On Sunday, during an open-air mass, the pope will give the traditional `` Urbi and Orbi'' greetings to the pilgrims in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square and television viewers around the world. That Mass caps a week of Easter activities. On Friday evening, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> carried a simple black wooden cross in a torchlit procession at the Colosseum. Tens of thousands watched the `` Via Crucis'' or way-of-the-cross, as the pope stopped at the 14 stations that symbolize <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s agonizing walk to his crucifixion. On Thursday at the Basilica of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the <PERSON> Lateran </PERSON>, the pontiff washed the feet of 12 priests in a service recalling Christ's last supper with the apostles. Earlier Saturday, workers prepared for the outdoor Mass by adorning the stairs to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>'s with thousands of flowers of a multitude of colors. They hung ruby-colored draperies from the columns around the entry to the Basilica and from the papal balcony. Hundreds of chairs were placed near the stairs and workers installed loudspeakers so the huge crowd expected Sunday can hear the pope.

<HEAD>Stress-Test On Shuttle Booster Apparent Success, NASA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A stress test showed the space shuttle's redesigned solid rocket boosters apparently can withstand the weight of the orbiter, launch pressures and then some, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday The structural load test was another step in certifying the space shuttle for flight, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Medal </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at its Marshall Space Flight Center. Hydraulic systems were used to apply pressures to a shortened solid rocket booster. The test section was subjected to forces equaling 150 percent of those normally experienced during launch, he said. The booster rocket was not fired. `` Detailed analysis of the load condition will be conducted ... over the next several weeks, but it appears the test was successsful in demonstrating the capability required with reserve for returning the shuttle to flight status,'' said Medal. He said the test booster, with included a flared aft skirt like the two that support the shuttle's weight on the launch pad, failed at the predicted weld when subjected to excessive pressures during the Friday night procedure. `` This test demonstrated a capability greater than that tested prior to the first shuttle launch,'' said Medal. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of Challenger in which seven people died. Investigators blamed the disaster on a failed solid rocket booster joint that allowed flames to burn into the vehicle's huge external fuel tank. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to resume shuttle flights this summer.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday reported a record increase in converts during 1987, and leaders warned members against ostracizing non-Mormons in the church's <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> stronghold. Leaders also announced the appointment of two new members of the leadership hierarchy and named a new president to the church's organization for children Mormon missionaries baptized 227,284 new members last year, compared to 216,210 in 1986, according to the annual statistical report of the 6.5-million-member church. The membership report was delivered on the opening day of the 158th Annual General Conference of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. The two-day conference has drawn thousands of Mormons from around the world to hear sermons from the church's hierarchy, including President <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 88, who is considered a prophet. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sackley </PERSON>, 65, <LOCATION> Bow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON>, 56, <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, were named new members of the Seventy, full-time clergy who assist the governing First Presidency in directing the church. <PERSON> Sackley </PERSON> is currently president of the church's mission in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> is directing missionary efforts in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, area. <PERSON> Michaelene </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassli </PERSON> was named president of the children's program Primary She succeeds <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> J. Young, who is leaving the position to accompany her husband, who has been appinted president of the <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, Mission. The church's success in proselytizing has been accompanied by a sharp increase in its missionary force, which has grown to 34,750 men and women, compared to 31,803 during 1986. `` Outside the church, many watch in amazement at this consistent expansion, in spite of popular secularism,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON> of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve are full-time clergy who assist the three-member First Presidency in directing the church. The Seventy follow the Twelve in the hierarchy. But while leaders celebrated the growth, they warned members to avoid religious arrogance, particularly in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where non-members often complain that they are excluded from politics and social life. About two-thirds of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 1.6 million people are Mormon, and church members hold nearly all major political offices. The governor and the congressional delegation are members. More than 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> is Mormon, including the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, and the majority leaders in both chambers. Numerical superiority does not justify disdain for those who are not Mormon, said <PERSON> Dallin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON>, a member of the Twelve and former <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice. He said he recently received a letter in which the writer complained that newcomers who are not Mormon arrive in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> to find themselves `` excluded at best and ostracized at worst.'' That sentiment was demonstrated last week when <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> turned down a job as chief of the privately run <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, saying the state has an image of being inhospitable to non-Mormons. `` I was asked what my religion was more in one afternoon in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> than I have in my entire life,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. `` Dull'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, self-proclaimed leader of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Folks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unlimited </ORGANIZATION>, crashed the seventh annual National Humor Conference Saturday to panhandle for his mythical presidential candidacy. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a statistical analyst from <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, became the champion of dullards everywhere with the creation of <LOCATION> DENSA </LOCATION>, an organization whose name stands for nothing except as a send-up of the high-IQ society, Mensa. Talking to a roomful of professors gathered at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for a serious study of humor in American society, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> made his money pitch: `` I said I'm in room 228 in the Union Club. You can just leave your $ 250 checks ouside the door. I have n't seen any yet.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> is actually a registered participant and welcome, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsen </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s kind of self-deprecating humor won a nod of appreciation from the professors. `` It's funny because it's a reversal,'' said <PERSON> Nilsen </PERSON>. `` It's an opposite of expectations. Whatever our frustrations are, we have ways of dealing with those frustrations by using this kind of humor.'' It's more sophisticated than one-liner humor that commonly targets ethnic groups, politicians or sex, he said. `` It's a coping device,'' he said. `` You have to develop coping devices for the real problems of the world.''

The four-day humor conference, attended by about 70 professors from a variety of disciplines, runs through Monday.

<HEAD>London paper claims Israel and China in a secret arms deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said there is a secret <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> operation under way to sell advanced missile technology to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sent a five-man team of military specialists to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in November and a deal was made to supply the Chinese armed forces with missile warheads and armor-piercing devices developed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The newspaper identified one of the men it said traveled to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but did not give further attribution. It said there are indications <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been helping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> develop its own multipurpose combat fighter plane using technology derived from the canceled Israeli Lavi fighter. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had helped finance development of the Lavi, and the program was dropped after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> complained about delays and rising costs. `` Western intelligence agencies have suspected for some time that there is a link between Israeli expertise and the speed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has shown in developing advanced weaponry,'' The Sunday Times said. According to the newspaper, the arms deal was supervised by <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhav </PERSON>, who it said is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and formerly worked for <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> do not have diplomatic relations. The Sunday Times said five men flew to the Chinese capital of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> using passports from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. It identified one of the men as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Radomsky </PERSON> and said he was program manager of the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> IMI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Radomsky </PERSON> `` reluctantly admitted that he and his team traveled to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' the report said, adding: `` He also said that, far from being a rogue operation, the covert mission to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had been cleared at the highest levels of the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> government.'' The newspaper said the other four members of the delegation were all experts in <ORGANIZATION> IMI </ORGANIZATION>'s missile division. Lawmaker <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont-Dark </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday night that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should freeze all technology and information exchanges with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> until it explains the deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> should tell <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the arrangement is `` totally unacceptable.'' `` We can not go on sharing things with people who want to sell it to a potential adversary for mercenary reasons, or with people we can not trust,'' <PERSON> Beaumont-Dark </PERSON> said. The Sunday Times said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially denies arms ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION>, the authoritative military affairs magazine, estimates the trade is already worth as much as three billion dollars.'' It claimed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wanted to keep its military links with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> secret `` for fear of harming its position in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sought secrecy because a missile deal with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would antagonize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has expressed concern about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sale of silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to The Sunday Times.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> condemned the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Saturday for corruption and economic suffering, telling striking meat workers, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is on the way out and we're on the way in.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> began two days of campaigning among <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Democrats who hold caucuses Monday night to apportion 45 delegates. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s important primary follows on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't refer to his Democratic rivals, except for ex-candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator. `` Since my friend <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is out, I am <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s favorite son,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spoke to about 1,000 workers outside the Monfort Portion Foods meatpacking plant, where workers have been on strike for higher wages since Nov. 16. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said there have been `` seven years of midnight'' under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He referred to the Easter season in encouraging strikers to continue to have hope. `` Innocent people do suffer _ that's one of the lessons of Easter,'' the black preacher and civil rights activist told the mostly white audience. `` But just because you're suffering, do n't surrender,'' he said. `` In the end, faith will not disappoint. ... `` They could not stop the government from killing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, but the government could not stop new hope, could not stop resurrection, could not stop renewal,'' he said. `` We can not stop Reaganomics, but Reaganomics can not stop us. ... <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is on the way out and we're on the way in _ we, the people, are on the way in.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> rivals has called for the resignation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, blasted the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for what he said was corruption and contempt. `` The Iran-Contra scam expresses contempt for the law. We must have a president who knows and respects the law, a president who sets the moral tone for our nation,'' he said. `` We have in this administration the most indictments, the most corruption, the highest sleaze factor in the history of American government. We deserve better government. We deserve honorable leaders.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received an enthusiastic response from about 2,000 people _ mainly white and Hispanic _ who gathered later at an outdoor rally in <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>. He then headed to the mountain resort of <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION> _ which had 1 -LCB- feet of snow last week _ where he was attending a fund-raising event and speaking to a group of local residents and skiers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign said it had had its best success ever in raising money during the past month. Campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the campaign raised $ 2.1 million during March, including $ 500,000 in the week since <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stunning victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s caucuses. She said that since Super Tuesday, the amount of money received by the campaign by mail has increased from about $ 20,000 a day to $ 60,000 a day. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> planned to attend Easter services in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on Sunday morning. In <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated his common themes of attacking corporations for exporting jobs and exploiting cheaper foreign labor. He led the crowd in chanting that they would vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at caucuses around the state Monday night _ meetings called `` get togethers'' rather than by their formal name, which he said was intimidating to average voters. He noted that they fall on April 4, the 20th anniversary of the assassination of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was present as a young aide to the civil rights leader. Answering questions after his speech, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called efforts to require only English to be taught as the main language in schools a `` mean-spirited mistake.''

<HEAD>President Extends State of Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> on Saturday extended a state of emergency in an important mining region where leftist guerrillas have repeatedly attacked mines and railroads. A decree in the official gazette, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peruano </LOCATION>, said the emergency measures would be extended for another two months across the mountainous eastern half of <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> state. Cerro de Pasco, the state capital, is 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Pasco is the center of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s vital mining industry that provides more than 50 percent of the nation's foreign exchange. Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have made hundreds of attacks in the zone in an effort to cripple <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economy. The government began decreeing states of emergency in November 1980 because of the insurgency. Parts of seven states, including <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, currently are under states of emergency. A state of emergency suspends citizens' rights to travel and assemble freely and permits government forces to conduct searches without warrants and hold suspects for lengthy periods without filing charges. The government says more than 10,000 people have been killed in violence related to the Shining Path's eight-year-old campaign to gain power.

 A 9-year-old girl whose lower legs were amputated after she was found abandoned and freezing has a new foster family and should be leaving the hospital before long, officials say. <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, has been learning to walk on artificial legs at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rabida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Hospital.

Her mother, <PERSON> Darlwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>, 24, was charged with felony child neglect.

<HEAD>Opposition Party Votes To Merge With Government Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The party of former opposition leader <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> voted Saturday to merge with the ruling party of Prime Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> in a step to unite the nation's most powerful political movements. <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, opened the party's one-day congress with a plea to more than 5,000 delegates to endorse a unity accord he signed with <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> on Dec. 23. <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> said, `` This accord opens up broad vistas for the economy of the country through the participation of all the people in development.'' <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, 70, needed a simple majority vote to endorse the merger but the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> passed two resolutions by unanimous vote. The resolutions approved the merger and asked <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> to proceed with uniting their parties' structures under one banner, effectively dismantling <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s party. `` This country will owe a lot to your decisions,'' <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> said after the vote. `` We have a collective vision. We must stand together. We must not deceive each other.'' <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is to vote on the unity accord on April 9. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> originally were allies in the campaign to bring majority black rule to the country that was the white-ruled British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>. In 1963, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and some other officials left <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s party to form their own leftist movement. Both parties were outlawed by then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s white-dominated government in 1964 <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, along with hundreds of other black nationalists, were detained for more than a decade. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> then became leaders in a seven-year guerrilla war that ended when the country became independent on April 18, 1980. The alliance <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> had formed during the war came apart after <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s party won <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s first election after independence. <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> remained political foes until Dec. 23, when they signed the unity accord that signaled an end to frequent fighting between their supporters. In January <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> was appointed one of three senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers in a government shuffle. If both parties approve the merger, <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, 64, will have the support of all but one legislator in the 100-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the 40-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He needs the vote of all 140 lawmakers to change the constitution and establish a one-party socialist state that he advocates. The dissident lawmaker is businessman <PERSON> Goodson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sithole </PERSON>, but political observers say he could join <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s party before a vote is taken in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> later this year. In another development, a gang of men stabbed to death a white Zimbabwean farmer at his home and beat his wife unconscious, police reported Saturday. They said the body of <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Toit </PERSON>, 55, was found by the family cook Friday in the farmhouse near the town of <LOCATION> Karoi </LOCATION>, 112 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. Police said they had not determined the motive, but neighbors who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Toit </PERSON> recently had argued with some of his black employees.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Saturday he would stay in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president primarily because, `` I want to be a rallying point for conservatives.'' `` I am the only conservative in the race, because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is considered to be a moderate,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> before Monday's precinct caucuses. `` There could n't be anything more deadly than to be taken off the evening news and off the front page of the newspaper, and that is what is going to happen as soon as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has it locked up,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. At a news conference before a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday afternoon, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was asked about his role at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in August. `` I want to address the issues _ how we stand on taxes and following the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agenda,'' the former television evangelist said, adding he believes the 1984 Republican platform should be retained. `` I like the'84 GOP platform very much,'' he said, defining it as a conservative position on strong defense, conservative judges, fighting communism, lowering taxes `` and being less intrusive in the lives of people.'' The rally audience _ estimated by police at 400 people _ received information sheets placed on each seat that instructed them in ways to be important factors Monday night at <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s precinct caucuses, the starting point for sending 36 delegates to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention `` Keep your preference under wraps _ unknown!'' the sheet told the audience members, adding that they should `` be polite'' but should try to find out who people are supporting for president `` carefully.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s speech at the rally emphasized the importance of the family, the need for winning the war against drugs and AIDS and bringing God back into public school classrooms. He told the audience: `` I am going to be the champion of the Christian and conservative points of view ... if it takes until 1992 to do it.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> planned to give an Easter Sunday sermon to an estimated 5,000 people in four congregations in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area. Campaign aides said they had up to 10 phone bank operators trying to persuade at least 10,000 people to show up for caucuses Monday night. `` Our goal would be to have 15,000,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> businessman who is coordinating <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> campaign

She said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, had been in the hospital since March 25. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, a Republican member of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state assembly between 1935-51 and speaker for three consecutive terms, served as <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s governor in 1956 and 1957. He was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in November 1960, and served through 1974. After leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he joined the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> and remained there until 1979, serving in 1976-77 as its chairman. In 1981, then-President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> called <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> out of retirement to serve a year as interim member of the commission. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s request that he rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> illustrated the government's respect for <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>, said former Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., who described <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> as a friend ever since they served in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> legislature together in the 1940s `` He served longer than he was supposed to,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I think he was one of the most respected members who ever served in the House.''

After serving in the state legislature, he was elected state attorney general in 1950, 1952 and 1954 before being named governor for two years. He lost a re-election bid to the statehouse. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s re-election defeat in 1958 was the only serious setback in his political career. `` Unfortunately, 1958 was a bad year for Republicans,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> is survived by three children _ <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> _ and two grandchildren.

 Greek bakers in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> worked overtime making Easter Bread, a small <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town carried on a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman's decorating tradition, and pastors all over fretted Saturday that the start of daylight-saving time would make parishioners tardy for services. In eastern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where tornadoes ripped through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gladewater </LOCATION> and Union Grove Friday night, hundreds of people banded together and spent their Easter weekend cleaning up debris. Pastor <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> Pastor <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said Sunday's service will focus on the storm that damaged or destroyed 46 homes. `` Even though we've gone through difficulties and a loss of property there still is hope, and that's what the resurrection is all about _ a new life,'' <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said Saturday. Many pastors shared a less serious worry on Easter Eve _ whether congregants would remember to set their clocks an hour ahead before going to bed. `` I know there's been concern,'' said Pastor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> deHeyman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Redeemer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. It was a stuck drawbridge, not an unset clock, that delayed the Easter Bunny from his appointed round Saturday morning in Grand Haven, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The local <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> held up their egg hunt until the guest of honor could arrive. For Sunday's Easter egg hunt in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, organizers were plotting how to foil overzealous parents who cheat to help their children win prizes. More than 1,000 children were expected to participate in the event at <LOCATION> Deming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in one of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s biggest annual easter egg hunts In the past adults have painted winning numbers on eggs, or found the highly coveted gold and silver eggs and passed them off to their kids, said <PERSON> Georgeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoffstall </PERSON> of the American Legion, which sponsors the event. Sixty monitors will be on hand to keep parents from collecting any of the nearly 2,000 hidden eggs. `` We could use a 150,'' <PERSON> Schoffstall </PERSON> said. For more than 50 years, passers-by in <LOCATION> Bement </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, marveled at the thousands of colored eggs, plastic rabbits and ducks, and statues of geese and goslings that adorned <PERSON> Zenaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s yard. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> died last fall at age 73, her spirit lives on, thanks to some old-fashioned community spirit and Mrs. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, who donated the decorations to the <ORGANIZATION> Bement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Some of the council members went to the <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> home on Friday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Troop </ORGANIZATION> pitched in to set out the same decorations that the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> woman had displayed for nearly half a century, many of which she had made herself. `` She always told us that in the old country, they decorated for Easter like we do for Christmas, so she brought the tradition with her,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, president of the council. A 60-year tradition in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> of showing off live bunnies before Easter may be dropped next year, says the florist who sets up the elaborate display. The fenced-in display, in which dozens of adult and baby rabbits hop around a lawn or snuggle in wooden boxes cut to resemble buildings along <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ave. </LOCATION>, opens 10 days before Easter and lasts until Easter Sunday. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinuk </PERSON>, owner of Scheinuk The Florist, says thousands come to see and sometimes buy the rabbits, but the display has been picketed by activists charging animal cruelty. `` It will be determined by the public. If they want us to have the rabbits next year, we suggest that they write in to us,'' he said Saturday. On Good Friday in <LOCATION> Traverse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, members of a youth group from <ORGANIZATION> Faith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> carried a 120-pound pine cross more than two miles, traversing <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> to their church. The Rev. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said although the youths may have been embarrassed carrying the cross, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was embarrassed, too. `` It's like if you had to carry an electric chair through the streets of your town,'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> died in the most humiliating way.'' Easter does n't fall until April 10 for <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION>, but that has n't delayed holiday preparations. At the <ORGANIZATION> Astoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greektown </LOCATION> district, bakers were busy all day Saturday making loaves of Easter bread, a rich pastry with a red egg in it, symbolizing the blood of Christ. `` It's been crazy,'' said baker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oster </PERSON>. `` We ca n't get it out fast enough.'' Owner <PERSON> Tasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Teftsis </PERSON> said he opened the shop at 6 a.m. and `` there were people waiting in cars outside.'' He said he planned to stay open until 2 a.m. `` They want six, eight, 10,'' he said. `` We're backed up too much.''

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration so far has rejected using military force to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, a White House spokesman said Saturday. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> scoffed at reports of a clamoring within the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for tougher measures to push <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, saying the Panamanian problem has presented a `` fertile ground for rich imaginations.'' Several news reports have said that Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged in high-level White House meetings that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attempt to kidnap <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in this country on drug-trafficking charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that the administration also considered establishing headquarters in the former <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> _ who has been in hiding since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted him in February _ and surrounding the area with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces so <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> could campaign more effectively for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Saturday sought to minimize reports indicating the administration was weighing military or covert action moves to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power. And <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, speaking with reporters in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Saturday as he continued a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peacemaking mission, sidestepped questions about his advice to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We debate various possible options,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` But basically, this is a question of a person who no longer is wanted in his country. The position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is that he should go. Everybody agrees about that. He's been indicted.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> steadfastly refused to get into a debate about he options he has proposed, saying that `` I never comment on speculative news articles.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Saturday's editions that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also had urged the dispatch of about 3,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to further undermine <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s grip on power. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, it said, was displeased with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to bolster the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by sending about 1,300 troops, many of them military police officers. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described the deployment of these forces, beginning early this week, as simply `` a continuation'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to strengthen security for Americans in the troubled Central American country. `` There have been any number of offensive plans raised, but to this point, they have been rejected,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' intentions in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to protect'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets and the approximately 40,000 American citizens living there. `` Clearly, the decisions at this point have been limited to defensive -LRB- options -RRB-,'' he said, `` reinforcing security in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. We want to be sure we have enough troops to protect our 40,000 citizens there.'' Deputy White House press secretary <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> said `` the whole range of diplomatic, political and military options have been considered. The kinds of things being reported can be considered in that category.'' She said `` the only decision the president has made is to enhance the security forces, as announced by the Pentagon.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to be drawn into a discussion of the reported feud between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> over the options to be pursued in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But the spokesman did say that the decision to send the additional 1,300 troops to the county was made by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had said Friday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be kept abreast of the Panamanian situation as he and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, vacation this week at their mountaintop ranch near here. National security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and is staying at a hotel in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, along with several other presidential aides. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so far has mainly applied economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but the administration's moves have not succeeded Late last week, the administration said it was considering a plan to seek the withholding of tax payments owed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations that do business there.

 The guns are silent for the time being in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and there is even a truce of sorts between Republicans and Democrats on the contentious issue of aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. And as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and the U.S.-backed rebels prepare to negotiate a settlement to end their six-year war, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has remained uncharacteristically silent, no longer using apocalyptic terms to discuss its perception of the stakes involved. Along with its rhetoric, the administration is lowering its expectations of its ability to influence events in the region. But most officials believe the Sandinista government is going into the peace talks in a commanding position because of Contra military weakness. For now, almost everyone, from the Sandinista government to administration and congressional hardliners, believes the peace process should be allowed to go forward without guns ablaze. Just a few weeks ago, bipartisanship on the Contra aid issue seemed beyond reach. An administration aid proposal was defeated narrowly in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 3 and a substitute Democratic plan also was rejected by a slim margin a few weeks later. But this past week, both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly approved a $ 48 million package providing humanitarian aid for the Contras as well as for children on both sides who have been injured in the conflict. The package includes $ 10 million for independent verification of the cease-fire agreement. Following Contra acquiescence to a 60-day cease-fire on March 23, both Republicans and Democrats agreed that this type of aid package was the only option available to them. But the legislation also includes a promise by House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, that he will not block `` fair and orderly'' consideration of a new military aid request if the peace talks collapse due to Sandinista intransigence. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., noted that the aid bill did not provide weapons for the rebels, as Contra supporters had hoped And it went too far for Contra opponents, who object to sending any aid. `` This package strikes a balance,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said during an unusually harmonious floor debate on the proposal last Thursday. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said the sole purpose of the package is to support the cease-fire agreement: `` If not for that agreement, we would n't be doing this today.'' The official administration line is that the temporary cease-fire was a step forward, and it is now up to the disputants to resolve their differences at the bargaining table when peace talks begin. Those talks were scheduled to begin Wednesday, but the Contras said Saturday they would delay the talks for one week to provide more time for technical commissions of both sides to work out details of the five zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> where rebel forces are to gather under the provisions of the cease-fire accord. But a government statement signed Saturday by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> stressed it was `` extremely important'' to comply with the cease-fire pact's timetable and stick by the April 6 meeting date. The administration's low-key attitude was symbolized by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision on Friday to sign the aid legislation in his White House residence, forgoing the ceremonial fanfare that attends some bill-signings. The administration has long contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to democratize and demilitarize only through Contra military pressure, or at least the threat of it. Just last February, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the Sandinista government `` will be free to continue the consolidation of their totalitarian regime, the military buildup inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and communist subversion of their neighbors'' if military aid to the Contras stops. The administration has not renounced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s grim prediction but it appears that an informal moratorium has been placed on that type of rhetoric. Things have been quiet in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as well. A formal cease-fire replaced the temporary one on Friday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported no violations. Many Nicaraguans marked the long Easter weekend by taking vacations at beaches on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast. Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants were closed until Monday. When talks on a permanent truce begin, the Contras are expected to issue demands for 17 democratic reforms, abolition of the draft, the repatriation Soviet bloc military advisers and other measures. In effect, they will be asking the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate the revolution, something the government has said it would never do. The process is not expected to be free of friction.

 Police arrested 11 protesters who moved into vacant apartments at a public housing project Saturday, but did not arrest demonstrators who set up a nearby tent city, officials said. The 11 who were arrested at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON> were charged with criminal trespass and released on $ 100 bond apiece, said Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Touhy </PERSON> He said police were called to the buildings by housing authority security guards. The protesters were members of the Chicago-Gary Area Union of the Homeless, and moved into the vacant apartments as part of a two-pronged demonstration on behalf of the city's estimated 25,000 homeless. The other half of the demonstration involved setting up a dozen tents on a vacant lot nearby. Union members vowed to stay in the tents for a week, saying they wanted to call attention to the housing authority's refusal to allow the homeless to stay in its vacant apartments. Several members of the union said they would try to move back into the apartments where the 11 were arrested. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a secretary for the union, said this weekend was chosen for the protest because April 1 is the date that half of the city-run shelters and warming centers for the homeless were closed this year. She estimated that about 500 people had to go back on the streets because of the seasonal move.

<HEAD>Carter Administration Considered But Dropped Arms For Hostages
Swap in 1980</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration considered an arms-for-hostages swap in 1980 but scuttled the plan because of doubts about the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> go-between, newly declassified documents show. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> considered offering $ 10 million in military spare parts for 52 Americans held hostage at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday editions. However, the administration backed away from the plan after deciding arms dealer <PERSON> Houshang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavi </PERSON> did not have the backing of <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>, then president of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the newspaper reported. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sold arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of some American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Funds from the sale were diverted to Contra rebels at a time when such aid was banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The declassified documents, mostly Carter-era <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memos, provide the first detailed account of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> efforts to extricate the hostages before the 1980 election, which <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won by a landslide. Lavi, an Iranian-born resident of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, became involved with the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration after first contacting the campaign of independent presidential candidate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The documents gave no indication whether the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign was approached. The documents were turned over to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, as part of his investigation into whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign made a secret arms-for-hostages deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> One of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> memos, dated Oct. 3, 1980, mentioned a conversation between an unidentified agency officer and Lavi in which he offered to make the hostage exchange and handed over a a seven-page list of F-14 parts. Lavi `` wished to arrange the delivery to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of $ 8 -LRB- million -RRB- to $ 10 million of F-14 spare parts,'' the memo said, adding he `` would arrange the swap of all the hostages upon the delivery of the spare parts'' and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement to unfreeze Iranian assets, forgive claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and stay out of internal <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> affairs. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer recommended against pursuing the offer. The memos indicate <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> officials ended contacts with <LOCATION> Lavi </LOCATION> on Oct. 19, 1980, after a foreign ambassador in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> had not been aware of Lavi's offer. <ORGANIZATION> WLS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reported Oct. 15, 1980, that arms-for-hostages talks were under way, and a 1984 congressional investigation concluded the leak came from a `` highly placed member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community'' associated with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign.

<TEXT>
 Nicaraguan rebels on Saturday said they would delay talks with the Sandinista government for one week, but the government called on the Contras to stick to the original timetable for discussing a lasting peace. The high-level talks between delegations from the government and rebels, known as Contras, were scheduled to begin on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. A rebel leader indicated the Contras wanted more time for technical commissions of both sides to work out details of the five zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> where rebel forces are to gather under the provisions of a 60-day cease-fire accord. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, one of the top Contra leaders, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the rebel delegation will not meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> until April 12. `` We feel it's not violating the accord,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said of the postponement. A government statement Saturday signed by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> stressed it was `` extremely important'' to comply with the cease-fire pact's timetable and stick by the April 6 meeting date. The statement said the government considered it `` counterproductive to postpone the April 6th high-level meeting.'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said the Contras showed `` a tendency to systematic lack of compliance with the agreed-upon calendar'' of the accord. The agreement to meet Wednesday in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, which would be the first talks between the two sides in the Nicaraguan capital, had been reached in negotiations last month in the village of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> beside the border with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. A Tinoco letter released Saturday night, which apparently had been prepared before the Contras insisted on a postponement, disclosed plans for the Wednesday meeting. It said arrangements had been made for the talks to be held in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s Hotel Las Mercedes beginning at 4 p.m. `` as is stipulated in the Sapoa accords.'' The letter addressed to rebel leaders said Sandinista and Costa Rican officials were to guarantee the Contra delegation's security. It added the government would consider `` counterproductive any type of political activity outside the framework and objective of the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> meeting.'' U.S.-backed rebel and leftist govenment leaders signed an agreement March 23 aimed at ending the more than six-year war. The Sandinistas met the first parts of the plan by freeing 100 political prisoners, holding technical talks on the cease-fire and formally enacting the 60-day cease-fire on Friday. But the two days of technical talks among military officers from both sides failed to net desired results for the Contras. According to the cease-fire agreement, the rebels are to move into zones during the first 15 days of April while talks go on for the duration of the 60-day cease-fire. The two sides agreed to five zones but failed to specify their size or exact locations. Nor did they work out operating guidelines while the rebels remained in the zones. The Sandinistas reportedly want the Contras to lay down their arms, a move the rebels say they will not do. The delay was necessary because the technical commissions `` still are negotiating ... verification of the zones and the modus operandi'' of Contra fighters inside the zones, <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON> said in an interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> also charged the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had violated the agreement by not freeing the prisoners they had requested. `` They played tricks. They released only about 10 of those we requested. The rest were -LRB- those -RRB- held for a few days,'' he said. The Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella group, also said Saturday the government has refused to sell necessary printing materials to the opposition <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper `` while it continues granting all paper and other materials for publication to the other newspapers,'' in violation of the pact's condition for full press freedom in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Under the terms of the cease-fire pact, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said they would release all 3,300 political prisoners gradually, the last coming after the 60-day cease-fire period ended June 1. The government also pledged full freedom of expression. The Contras pledged to accept only humanitarian aid through a neutral organization. That clause, according to the Sandinistas, means the rebels can receive only civilian clothes, food and medicine and that it must come through an organization such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>.

 After centuries of debate, scientists in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> may finally determine whether the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> is a medieval forgery or old enough to have existed at the time of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s death on the cross. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, for the first time, is allowing radiocarbon-dating of the mysterious linen, which appears to bear the image of a crucified man and is venerated by some as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s burial cloth. A date from the Middle Ages will be compelling evidence of what skeptics have argued all along _ that the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> is a fake. Although no one will ever prove the image is <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s, a date anywhere near 2,000 years old could cause a sensation, for it would indicate the shroud existed when <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was crucified. `` I would be rather awed if it looked extremely probable that it was his burial cloth,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, one of the scientists carrying out the tests. The British Museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific validity of the carbon-dating, which is to be done independently on nuclear atom-counters at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION>. No timetable has been set, but Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tite </PERSON>, director of the museum's research laboratory, said tests should begin this spring and the results announced possibly by the summer. The triple carbon-dating should reveal the shroud's age within a 200-year range, he said. `` If you get a medieval date, then clearly it is not The Shroud,'' <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said in an interview. `` If you get a date of the period of Christ, then it does n't tell you anything _ except that it tells you it could be the genuine thing. The most extensive investigation was the 1978 Shroud of <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, in which dozens of scientists subjected the cloth to chemical analysis and took 30,000 photographs of it. They concluded the stains were human blood and the image too thin to be an artist's work. The shroud, 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide, bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and back of a man's body Stains, scientifically identified as blood, can be seen around the wrists, forearms and head, corresponding to New Testament descriptions of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s wounds from being whipped, speared, nailed to a cross and crowned with thorns. Believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of energy accompanying Christ's resurrection. Skeptics, however, maintain it was painted during the Middle Ages, when the production of fake religious relics was commonplace. Historical records have authoritatively traced the shroud to 1354. References to the shroud before then are sketchy, and scientists have long tried to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to subject it to carbon-dating. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which owns the shroud, previously argued that carbon-dating would damage the cherished linen. But the development of an atom-counter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer in the 1970s made it possible to date objects with much smaller samples. The old technique would have required a piece of the shroud the size of a paper napkin. The spectrometer can use a sample no bigger than a postage stamp. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> refused to say when samples would be cut from the shroud, which is locked away in the cathedral at <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Scientists doing the tests have been barred from witnessing the sample-taking procedure or saying when they received their samples. Instead, the sample-cutting was being videotaped and photographed for documentation. Tite and the archishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON>, were to witness the cutting to certify the procedure. More controversially, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced in January that it would allow only three laboratories to take part in the tests, instead of the seven originally planned. The decision outraged, among others, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Otlet </PERSON>, director of one of the rejected labs, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s Isotope Measurements Laboratory at <PERSON> Harwell </PERSON> The lab is a world leader in dating archaeological finds. `` I think it's as much a catastrophe as it would be if you allowed bulldozers to go over an archaeological site before you've examined it,'' he said in an interview

 Another test center rejected by the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> was the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, which developed the nuclear carbon 14-dating technique chosen for the tests. Professor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gove </PERSON>, the lab director who spearheaded the campaign to carbon-date the shroud, said in a telephone interview that restricting the tests to three labs and thereby eliminating a second carbon-dating technique would make the results `` a lot less believable.'' `` There are a lot of people who think the shroud is a phony, so if the dating is a number that comes around 2,000 years, they're going to say there's been some kind of conspiracy,'' he said New Scientist, a British journal, accused the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> of revising the testing protocol to produce an ambiguous result that would allow people to continue believing in the shroud is a genuine relic. Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>, scientific adviser to the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, said the church never claimed the shroud was authentic, only that it might be and `` must be treated with respect and caution.'' The number of testing labs was restricted to minimize damage to the shroud, <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said, adding that the archdiocese had never agreed to allow more than three labs to participate. `` Critics talk about us reducing the number of labs from seven to three, while we see it as increasing it from one to three,'' he said in an interview. The British Museum's <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said there is no reason to think that three labs could not produce a sound result. `` It is in fact quite unusual to do two or three measurements on a normal archaeological specimen,'' he said. `` One is the normal number, two you're providing a check and three you're providing a doublecheck.'' <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said each test lab will receive a 0.3-square-inch sample of the shroud. They also will get two dummy cloth samples, one carbon-dated and the other dated historically but not scientifically, to see if they get consistent results for all three samples. The labs are not supposed to know which sample is from the shroud, but <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> acknowledged that the linen's distinctive herringbone weave would probably give it away under the microscope. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, head of the radiocarbon-dating unit at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeology </ORGANIZATION> and the History of Art, said he would not deliberately try to determine which of the three samples is from the shroud. `` In a sense, it almost puts one under too much pressure,'' he said in an interview. `` It's sort of more relaxed if one does n't really know. Either way, he added, it would n't affect the findings. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said carbon-dating would establish the time at which the flax in the shroud was growing, rather than when the cloth was made, although the two dates presumably are about the same. Asked how confident he was of establishing the shroud's age, <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said: `` I would n't put my life on it. But on the other hand, I'd make a pretty hefty bet.''

 The history of the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> goes back only about 800 years, when a crusading knight said he saw it in <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION>. It never has been traced to the Holy Land. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> does not claim it is <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' burial cloth, and many critics have dismissed the linen cloth and its image as a clever forgery. Perhaps the shroud's earliest known debunker was <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Arcis </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Troyes </LOCATION>. In a 1389 letter, he told <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VII </ORGANIZATION>, the papal claimant in <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION>, that the bishop who preceeded him in <LOCATION> Troyes </LOCATION> knew who painted it. `` The church is aware there is a big historical gap and it is also aware this historical gap will never be filled satisfactorily,'' Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>, the scientific adviser to the archbishop of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, said in a recent telephone interview. The shroud, bequeathed to the pope by ex-King <PERSON> Umberto </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> upon his death in 1983, has been kept in the cathedral at <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> since 1578. Through records, the shroud can be traced to <LOCATION> Lirey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1354. In 1453, the royal family of Savoy got the shroud and kept it at the castle of <LOCATION> Chambery </LOCATION>, where fire damaged it in 1532. There are references to it as early as the 5th or 6th centuries, and coincidences have been found between the shroud and 7th-century Byzantine art and liturgy. Witnesses including <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyre </ORGANIZATION> in 1171 and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Clari </PERSON> of the fourth crusade in 1203 reported seeing the shroud in the imperial palace at <LOCATION> Constantinople </LOCATION>. The trail then is lost until the shroud appears in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said the church does n't recognize the shroud as a relic but as a `` cherished object'' that must be given the respect due a relic. `` The church understands it will never know if it is the actual burial cloth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>. `` But it has the probability of being the burial cloth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and must be treated with respect and caution.'' Wrapped in red silk under protective glass and an iron grill, the shroud is kept on an altar in a silver chest that has only rarely been opened in the last century. Perhaps the most significant occasion was in 1898, when a man named <PERSON> Secundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pia </PERSON> was allowed to photograph it. The result was sensational. The image on the shroud is similar to a photographic negative, so the negative on <PERSON> Pia </PERSON>'s photographic plate gave the world its first positive image of the man on the shroud. <PERSON> Pia </PERSON>'s work confounded skeptics: Why would a medieval forger paint a negative image _ an image that produced a perfect positive visible only centuries later when photography was invented?

<HEAD>AP SPOTLIGHT: Shroud of Turin _ How Carbon-Dating Works</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One of a three-story package. With b0660-b0661, b0662.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here, briefly, is how carbon-dating works: All living things absorb carbon 14, a radioactive isotope created by rays bombarding the Earth's atmosphere from outer space. There is a certain proportion of carbon 14 to nonradioactive carbon 12 in the air and in living things. While plants and animals are alive, this proportion remains the same. When they die, they stop absorbing carbon 14. Because it is radioactive, carbon 14 decays at a known rate. It takes 5,730 years for half the carbon 14 to decay. Carbon 12 does not decay. So by measuring the proportion of carbon 14 to carbon 12 left in a sample, scientists can tell when the plant or animal it came from died. To count carbon atoms, a sample must first be converted into carbon dioxide. This is done by burning. A technique more advanced from original procedures used in the 1940s, when carbon-dating was first applied, uses a nuclear atom-counting machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer. It propels carbon dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed, causing the various atomic particles to separate and making it possible to detect carbon 12 and carbon 14.
