<HEAD>Reagan Bans from US Those Panamanians Who Help Noriega's Regime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is barring from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government and military officials known to support Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In a proclamation, the president Friday said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his handpicked president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, `` are preventing the legitimate government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from restoring order and democracy in that country.'' `` I have determined that it is in the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to restrict the entrance into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as immigrants and non-immigrants of certain persons who formulate or implement the policies'' of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until such time as the secretary of state determines that democracy has been restored in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' the president said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has tried unsuccessfully to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, to yield power to <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the order might affect several hundred Panamanians. The move prompted a quick denunciation and a threat of retaliation by the Panamanian government. `` We could not care less about any lists made up by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is free to make as many lists as it wants of Panamanians it does not want to admit there, just as we can make our lists of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens we do not want in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Under the president's proclamation, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will designate those Panamanian nationals who, with their families, will be barred from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of their role in aiding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime. Panamanians on the list who attempt to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be stopped at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports of entry or they would be denied visas at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular offices, the official said. The president said the order would be enforce so as not conflict with international obligations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or prohibit the entry of individuals into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to submit to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government legal proceedings. `` The purpose of the declaration is, in a very ungentle manner, to let <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters know that their continuing support for him is not going to be without some personal cost,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, asking not to be identified. The last time such a restriction was imposed occurred in 1985 when most non-immigrant Cubans were prevented from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Savio </PERSON> called himself `` not just an aging rabble-rouser but a parent also'' as the pioneer of the student movement of the 1960s spoke at his son's graduation from a prestigious <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> high school. The one-time <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> firebrand who helped trigger the student power movement also described his change during college from being `` a most unpolitical son of unpolitical Italian immigrants.'' `` We came to view <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as a racist and imperialist power ... -LRB- that -RRB- covered its tracks with a beguiling opportunity for self expression,'' the 45-year-old told the class at <ORGANIZATION> Sidwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was always right now in the'60s _ Freedom Now, <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Did we not know that we could spoil the work by the way we dashed it off?

<HEAD>Contra Leader Calls for Renewed US Arms Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leader Nicaraguan resistance leader says Contra forces could face annihilation at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> resumes military aid to the rebels. The Contra leader, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, said Friday at a news conference the aid was needed because of Sandinista threats to wipe out the insurgents if the latest round of peace talks did not produce a final settlement to the Nicaraguan war. Peace talks between the leftist Sandinista government and the Contras collapsed in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Thursday although both sides said a temporary truce would remain in effect. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was `` disappointed at the Sandinista rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> proposal to achieve democracy and an end to the war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration blamed the Nicaraguan government for the breakdown in talks, but said no decision had been made about whether to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for more aid for the insurgents. `` I think that in view of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' actions here, their unwillingness to negotiate in good faith, their unwillingness to instill democratic reforms, you may well see a press for Contra aid from members of the Congress and from people in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and from other sources, but at this point we have made no decisions,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to propose an aid package for the Contras that matches the amount of military assistance he said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> provided to the Sandinista government during the first three months of this year. He put the amount at $ 105 million. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, indicated he felt that was a reasonable amount. The rebels have received no military aid since Feb. 29. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last military aid request for the Contras on Feb. 3. But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., a leader of the anti-Contra forces in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said, `` This is no time to be talking of military aid. He called for additional efforts to achieve a peace settlement before a new military aid request is considered. The goal of the latest negotiating round, which began on Tuesday, was to end the war and install democratic reforms, in accordance with a preliminary peace plan signed on March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The discussions had been described as the fourth and final round of a series which have taken place under an interim truce.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, back in his home territory for the weekend, says he hopes to help forge an economic alliance among farmers and industrial workers. `` We want to bring people beyond racism, beyond sexism and beyond anti-Semitism,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in brief statements to reporters late Friday as he arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> from a campaign swing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would unveil his new plans today in a speech at the headquarters of Operation Push, the civil rights group he founded. The candidate said his latest 40-day campaign plan would focus on economic proposals. `` We'll focus on ways to protect workers, farmers, the aged and the poor against the ravages of Reagonomics,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked about polls indicating he would hurt <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a running mate against the Republican ticket headed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` If we are within four points of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> before the race begins, we have the capacity to win,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came in second place to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in delegate and popular vote count in the Democratic primaries, but a survey published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> suggested he would hurt the ticket among groups whose support the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> need to win in the fall. And another poll, conducted for <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, indicated a Dukakis-led ticket with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as the running mate would lose to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 47 percent to 40 percent. Otherwise, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win, 45 percent to 39 percent, the survey suggested. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said only that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserves to be considered, not that he has any special claim on the job. Confusion over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position on the matter has been heightened in recent days by a <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> report that quoted him as saying he wants to be vice president. `` Let's leave it at consideration,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when asked to clarify the matter. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he deserves to be offered a spot on the ticket, but the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Post </ORGANIZATION> survey found that two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters believe the nominee has the right to `` choose anyone he wants'' as a running mate. Only three in 10 said the second spot on the ticket should automatically go to the second-place finisher in the primaries, the poll said. The ABC-Post poll said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the vice presidential choice of 36 percent of all registered Democrats. However, nearly one-quarter of those surveyed said they would be less likely to vote for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were on the ticket. Only 12 percent said they would be more likely to vote Democratic with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the No. 2 spot, the poll said. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that he has better credentials than anyone else in politics to be the Democratic vice presidential nominee. While others may be qualified, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, none has shown ability to win 7 million votes as he did in the primary season or has his combination of regional and political strengths to balance a ticket headed by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We meet virtually every stated qualification for serious consideration on the ticket,'' he said. `` No one else at this point that's active in politics has shown the breadth of support I have shown at the voting polls; no one else has shown the ability to impact on the country's tone and the party's priorities. `` They may have state credentials. They've not shown themselves to have national vote-getting potential,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters who accompanied him to a two-day working vacation at the posh La Costa health spa north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> left La Costa Friday afternoon to head to return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he planned to meet with civil rights leaders and continue plans for the convention. Although visibly tired and talking very softly after his long flight, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brought a touch of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> casualness to the chilly <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> night. The often soberly dressed candidate was wearing blue jeans, leather sandals and a black jacket bearing the emblem of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warehousemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He also wore a silver pin in the form of a stevedore's pick _ a symbol of the union.

<HEAD>NEPTUNE OIL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ `` Lobbying efforts on behalf of a constituent with whom he had an interest in a private gas well venture.'' This allegation refers to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s actions in 1979 on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, owned in part by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON>. The speaker wrote to Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> a letter on behalf of the company, whose assets were at issue during the Camp David accords. The speaker says his financial relationship with the <PERSON> Moncrief </PERSON> family was unrelated to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and he had no personal financial stake in the outcome.

<HEAD>BOOK ROYALTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ `` Whether campaign funds were used, directly or indirectly, to pay for publication of a book from which he received a 55 percent royalty.'' The speaker earned about $ 55,000, based on the generous royalty arrangement on a book published by his friend, businessman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. The company owned by <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has done nearly $ 300,000 in work for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign. The speaker denies the favorable book contract was a way of repaying him for that business, or in any way a recycling of his campaign money for personal use.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL USE OF STAFF</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 _ `` Whether government resources were improperly used to complete work on a book from which he received royalties.'' This refers to the same book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' A member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff heled compile the paperback collection of the speaker's remarks and writings and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office used $ 2,000 in public money to send the aide to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to work on the project.

 _ `` The use of a condominium in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was given full use of a poolside condominium for his congressional district residence by the family of business partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Israel Allows Norwegian Inspection Of Heavy Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> have agreed that Norwegian experts can inspect a shipment of Norwegian heavy water, a chemical used in the production of nuclear weapons. Foreign Trade Minister <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbakk </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that an agreement on the inspection was negotiated by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> earlier this week, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported. The news agency said <PERSON> Mosbakk </PERSON> told parliament that about half of the 20 tons of heavy water sold to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1959 had vanished through waste and evaporation. Norwegian experts would be allowed to inspect the remaining half, <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said. When <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> sold <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the water almost 30 years ago the contract stipulated that <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> had the right to inspect the water and that it could be used for peaceful purposes only. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> did not raise the question of inspection until <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> nuclear technician <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> told a British newspaper that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had used heavy water to produce plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Vanunu </PERSON> is serving an 18-year prison term in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for treason. In three previous rounds of negotiations about the inspection issue, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejected a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> proposal to transfer its inspection right to the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Since <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> started production of heavy water in the late 1930s, about 450 tons have been exported, mostly for scientific research. Ten countries, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, received amounts large enough for use in nuclear reactors. Two nuclear powers, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, received heavy water from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> on the condition that they did no re-export it. Seven other import countries have signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which allows on-site inspection. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has not signed the treaty.

A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the order would probably affect several hundred Panamanians. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, responded to the order Friday by saying, `` We could not care less about any lists made up by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is free to make as many lists as it wants of Panamanians it does not want to admit there, just as we can make our lists of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens we do not want in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has imposed sweeping economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to force the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethancourt </PERSON>, president of the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scuttled an offer by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to provide $ 70 million in aid to help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> through the financial crunch caused by the sanctions. He said the Panamanian government first negotiated with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and when those discussions broke down, it turned to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which agreed to provide the money if it would be returned when U.S.-Panamanian relations improved. `` Then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insulted <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and blocked the negotiations by saying the Colombian money came from drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethancourt </PERSON> said. About $ 50 million in <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government assets has been frozen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency. In announcing the ban on Panamanian government officials, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his hand-picked president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, `` are preventing the legitimate government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from restoring order and democracy in that country.'' <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was deposed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in February the day after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. After he was ousted, his family took refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence, and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> apparently spends much time there. He often meets there with English-speaking journalists, who are asked not to disclose the location. At other times, according to sources speaking on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> stays in safe homes provided by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government at its military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` If they want him -LRB- <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> -RRB- to re-establish democracy, as they say, let him come out of his little <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here,'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s automotive industry, gripped by prolonged labor disputes, has lost more than $ 1.5 billion in production and exports, the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The ministry said lost production of parts and automobiles was estimated at $ 1.32 billion since January. Car export goals for the period were down by 37,330 vehicles, worth $ 219 million. Ministry officials said they feared Korean auto exports may fall far short of a year-end goal of 756,000 vehicles if the labor problems continued. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest automaker, has been struck since May 30 with its assemly plant in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> on the east coast shut down completely. Strikers are demanding higher pay and better conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was no immediate indication when suspended union-management wage talks would resume. They said both parties remained far apart on the extent of wage hikes. The union demanded an increase of 48 percent or about $ 180 a month, while the management offered a 25 percent raise or about $ 100. <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the second biggest automaker, was hit by strikes at its main plant near <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in April. The automaker is a joint venture between Korean interests and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Operations at the plants of <ORGANIZATION> Kia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, partly owned by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and two other smaller companies were also reported suffering from prolonged wage disputes or a lack of key parts caused by strikes at parts suppliers. Production operations have been suspended or reduced at about 500 parts makers for many weeks due to labor strikes, sabotage or other problems, with 600 other companies in normal operation. Some of the affected parts makers have asked for emergency bailout loans saying they face bankruptcy, but monetary authorities were reportedly reluctant to comply with the requests citing the government's tight money policy to counter feared inflation. Last year, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> produced one million cars and commercial vehicles and exported 540,000 of them.

 Japanese authorities have arrested a former public relations officer with the Prime Minister's Office for allegedly accepting bribes from an advertising company, authorities said today. Officials from the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> prosecutor's office on Friday arrested <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, 59, a former councilor in charge of government public relations, for accepting bribes in return for extending favors, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a nationally circulated daily, reported today that investigators found the two had entertained <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> with dinners in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and golf outings costing a total of $ 7,200. The entertainment led to increased orders for television advertisements, the report said. The prosecutor's office refused to confirm or deny the report. Another former Prime Minister's Office official was arrested in May for allegedly accepting about $ 18,400 in bribes from advertising agents.

<HEAD>Defense Rests In Mecham Criminal Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury will be asked to decide next week whether <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother committed a crime when they failed to itemize a $ 350,000 campaign loan _ a case the former governor insists is based on `` smoke and mirrors.'' The defense rested Friday in the trial of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, without calling either defendant to the stand during the seven days of testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury is to hear final arguments on Tuesday before starting deliberations. `` I'm confident that the state has not proved its case,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, told reporters as he left the courtroom Friday. The former governor stopped short of predicting acquittal but said, `` I think the smoke and mirrors that this whole thing has been created by ... has been totally revealed to the world.'' However, co-prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said, `` I think the state position is even stronger after the witnesses called by the defense.'' Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> denied the Mechams' requests for a directed verdict, in which the judge would render a verdict without the case going to the jury. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, are charged with concealing the $ 350,000 campaign loan on financial reports required by the state. The defense contended the loan was properly reported as part of a $ 465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The defense also said the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent mistake. But the prosecution maintained the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign badly needed the $ 350,000 loan and feared disclosing that it came from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> because <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s campaign theme was one of being `` beholden to no one.'' The <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan was not itemized on either <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s campaign or personal financial disclosure forms. During Friday's testimony, <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> sought to establish that <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was personally responsible for the failure to report the loan because he reported his finances as a candidate rather than a committee. Anyone who looked at <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s financial reports would not know <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> borrowed $ 350,000 from <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> contended while questioning Secretary of State <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, whose office is responsible for accepting such reports. `` Does the name <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> appear anywhere on the post-general contribution and expenditure report filed by <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> at your office?'' <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON>, a defense witness. `` I do n't see any contributor by that name,'' <PERSON> Shumway </PERSON> answered. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is on trial on six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all counts. His brother is charged with three similar counts and faces up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, took office in January 1987. He was removed from office April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts.

 <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, one of the first white South Africans ever banned by the government for anti-apartheid activities, is in serious condition at a hospital.

 Necessity may be the mother of invention but the possiblity of making a million dollars seems to help. An attorney who helped organize the 31st annual <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says some gadget makers come with dollar signs in their eyes. `` Some are quite naive,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Braddock </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> patent attorney. `` They will come and say ` I've got this invention. It works. Where do I go to get my million dollars?' It's often that simplistic. We try to put them on the right road.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludvigson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, said a harrowing experience led to his invention. `` I was almost killed off by a kid on a skateboard one night, so I went home and invented the ` thrasher flasher,''' said <PERSON> Ludvigson </PERSON>, a camera repairman and participant in the three-day <ORGANIZATION> Inventors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which began Friday. His thrasher flasher is essentially a headlight for a skateboard. It's a low-intensity strobe light attached to the board's wheel axle. Like many of the 88 exhibitors and 108 inventors at the congress, <PERSON> Ludvigson </PERSON> is hoping someone will spot the flasher and decide to market it. People come to the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has been held annually in <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> since 1958, not only to get exposure and to market their ideas, but also to find direction. Others come to get the public's reaction to their inventions, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Amoroso </PERSON>, a business development specialist from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` They want to know, ` Is there any market for my products?

<HEAD>UNESCO Plays Down Controversial Communications Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY DUNPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> officials have backed away from a proposal to create a global communications order that some Western nations viewed as a threat to the freedom of the press. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer to <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> cautiously praised the recommendations, released by the group's executive board Friday. The new communications strategy played down establishing a new world information and communication order. The concept lay at the heart of a decade-old debate at the 158-nation <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization and helped convince the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to withdraw. The board's recommendations go to <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON>, who is trying to persuade those two nations to rejoin. The report's communications section admitted that journalists had widely interpreted <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to establish a new world order as aimed at `` undermining freedom of information.'' `` This resulted in a misunderstanding that was used to sully the organization's image,'' it said. The section said <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> should `` explore the possibilities of a new strategy ... that will dispel the misunderstanding.'' It said the strategy should emphasize `` development of critical acumen among -LRB- media -RRB- users, the ability for individuals and communities to react to any kind of manipulation -LRB- by the media -RRB- and to become familiair with the means available to users to defend their right of reply.'' The section also said <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> should seek to `` ensure a free and wider and more balanced flow of information.'' In the past, Western governments and media groups have tried to replace the words `` more balanced'' with `` unrestricted.'' These governments and Western media groups expressed concern that the proposed new world communications order could lead to codes of conduct and licensing of journalists. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the latest recommendations, approved by consensus without a vote, contained `` scope for positive change.'' `` However, I am distressed at the tone'' in the communications section, which `` tries to set up an adversary relationship between the media and its audience.'' The board's recommendations, presented at the end of its spring meeting, are intended to guide Mayor in preparation of <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan of activities for the l990s At the board's opening meeting three weeks ago, Mayor, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> scientist who took office in November, proposed that <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s 14 major programs be reduced to five. He suggested that the organization should do fewer things but do them better and with more follow-up. The board has recommended cutting programs to seven. It added one dealing with peace, human rights and elimination of discrimination, and another that covers development studies. A group of 77 Third World countries and the Soviet bloc criticized Mayor for dropping these programs from his plan for the 1990s. Along with communications, the peace and human rights proposals have provoked controversial debates in the past. Mayor will use the document prepared by the board to draft an outline of the plan for the 1990s for the fall meeting of the board.

<HEAD>Missing Woman's Body Found Floating In Hudson</HEAD>

 The body of a gemologist who disappeared while carrying more than $ 500,000 worth of diamonds was tossed into the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after she was bludgeoned to death, officials said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>, 33, a free-lance gemologist, was last seen at her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building on Feb. 4, when she had an appointment to return six diamonds after a proposed sale fell through. Her naked body, bound in the fetal position around the neck, wrists and ankles, was found Thursday floating in the river near the lower end of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, police said. Her body was covered by plastic bags, police said. An autopsy Friday determined she died from multiple blunt force injuries to the scalp and face that caused skull fractures, brain contusions and brain hemorrhaging, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. `` She was n't in the water for very long,'' Ms. <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> said. `` She was not dead for a very long period of time from the time they found her -LRB- Thursday -RRB-. It certainly is not months. Whether its weeks or days, I can not pin it down.'' She was identified through dental records, Ms. <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> said. Two brothers who were friends of Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s were arrested in the case April 11 and have been in custody without bail since, police said. <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivalta </PERSON>, 48, and his brother <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON>, 33, allegedly arranged a meeting between Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> and a potential buyer that never took place. Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> called the diamonds' owner on Feb. 3 to say she would return the six diamonds worth between $ 500,000 and $ 600,000 the next day. A resident of her apartment building saw her in the building's vestibule the afternoon of Feb. 4, relatives said She was not seen after that. According to the complaint, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivalta </PERSON> sold a pear-shaped diamond that was among those Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> had in her possession to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> pawnshop for $ 14,000 on Feb. 17.

<HEAD>Report: Police Feared Popular Opposition; Party Calls For Radical
Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s increasingly open press has reported that federal authorities were worried about a popular uprising if they seized control in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the nation's most liberal republic. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, called for radical economic changes on Friday, including freer, profit-oriented markets and more foreign investment to overcome <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s deepening economic crisis Reports have circulated for several weeks that military authorities in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> were thinking about stepping in to quell liberal tendencies in the northernmost of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. Federal officials and Communist leaders in the republic have denied any plans for such an action. But <ORGANIZATION> NIN </ORGANIZATION> magazine on Friday published what it said were excerpts of a transcript of a discussion of the police role after such a takeover. A police official, whom the magazine did not identify, was quoted as speaking of police ability `` to control the situation after the arrests, since it is believed that the people will come out into the streets.'' NIN also quoted <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavcar </PERSON>, a spokesman for a group formed to fight the arrests of two journalists who first wrote of the alleged takeover, as saying the transcript means `` nobody believes that the stories about the coup have been fabricated.'' Authorities have denied any link between the journalists report on the takeover and their arrests last week by military authorities. Police have said the journalists were arrested along with a soldier after an unmarked document on combat readiness was found in their possession. <PERSON> Bavcar </PERSON> said his group would decide this weekend whether or not to call for a 15-minute general strike next Tuesday in protest at the arrests. The Slovenian daily Delo reported from <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> that more than 7,000 people have signed a petition calling for the release of the trio. Money is pouring into a special account to help the families of those held, and more than 200 companies, Communist party cells and trade union groups have backed the petition for release, <PERSON> Delo </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s official lawyers' union issued a statement saying public unease over the case should be seen as popular concern over preserving gains of democratization. `` State organs can not any longer demand in advance uncritical trust from the people,'' the lawyers said, calling for strict adherence to the law in the handling of the controversial case. The party's 52-page blueprint for economic change, largely adopted at a party conference last month, advocated `` the strengthening of market mechanisms'' and recomended measures to attract `` the investment of more foreign capital'' in the Yugoslav economy. It said the party supported `` investment of private funds'' in small businesses as a means of `` restructuring the economy and overcoming high unemployment.'' `` The theses call for sweeping economic reforms to ensure the autonomy of enterprises, the full affirmation of all elements of the market and of economic laws, a single home market and an opening to the world,'' the document said. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> suffers from 150 percent inflation, a $ 21 billion debt, worker unrest and heavily endebted firms. The government recently undertook a strict austerity program curbing wages and spending as part of sweeping changes to be completed before the end of the year. One of the party's most radical proposals is to base the economy, for the first time, on the profit motive, ending the practice of subsidizing and, when necessary, rescuing money-losing enterprises. The party blueprint also contained a reference to human rights, widely seen as a victory for a liberal faction in the party.

 A man whose doctoral dissertation was rejected by a faculty committee in 1942 but hailed by historians four decades later as a pioneering work has received his Ph.D. `` Celebrity is a new status and it's hard to get used to,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>, who gained national attention earlier this year when his dissertation was finally accepted, said Friday. `` But if all this hoopla was n't going on, I think I'd be feeling quite depressed,'' said the 77-year-old retired civil servant, who lives in <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, Md. `` My polio is acting up, my walking ability is reduced and I'm having difficulty getting out of a chair. `` But this attention, the commencement,'' he added, `` is such great compensation.'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> was a graduate student at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a disciple of the late Professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON>, the leading political scientist of the day and a member of then-President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s circle of advisers known as the `` Brain Trust. Under <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON>'s guidance, <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> re-examined the history of government planning in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He then argued in his dissertation that the country's early leaders, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> among them, had intended to use the powers of the federal government to develop the fledgling nation's resources through public works and other projects. The paper challenged the then-common conviction that <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION>'s New Deal social programs marked a departure from laissez-faire principles attributed to the founding fathers By the time his paper was rejected as not yet `` in satisfactory shape,'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> was married with a child to support. He said he could n't afford to return to campus as a full-time student to revise his manuscript, so he locked it away in a box. In the intervening years, he manufactured light fixtures, owned a chain of men's clothing stores in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and became a federal civil servant, eventually rising to become regional director for the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, supervising a five-state region in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` But I never changed my mind on the essential idea I'd developed in my paper,'' he recalled `` I maintained my interest in history, I looked everywhere, and whenever I read, I was constantly looking to see if someone else had it. `` I was so convinced I was right, and so convinced of the importance of it that tenacity was the easy part,'' he said. <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s reward came last year, when he read historian <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s `` Cycles of American History,'' a chapter of which made essentially the same argument <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON>'s paper had offered nearly a half-century earlier. He wrote to <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who looked at the dissertation and wrote back: `` Congratulations on your path-breaking work ... I am astonished by the fate of your thesis at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' Emboldened, <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> set in process a motion that culminated Friday with <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> receiving his doctorate. `` I'm not sure how the paper was rejected the first time, but my best guess is that after professor <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON> retired, my dissertation became a kind of orphan. `` Also, I was already working at making a living while it was being considered and I think the chairman of the department at the time may not have wanted the degree cheapened by giving it to someone who would n't use it,'' <PERSON> Bourgin </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if all that makes it any sweeter,'' he said. `` But it certainly has made the last few months of my life an interesting time.''

<TEXT>
 A 90-minute meeting with two high-level <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials gave the underground Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> `` much hope and strength,'' one of its lay leaders said. Also Friday, the 1,000 th anniversary of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> was marked with a gala at the Bolshoi Theater attended by <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, wife of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> American evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and Rabbi <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conscience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, were among the speakers. The meeting and the appearance of the Soviet leader's wife at a religious event underscored the changing attitude of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is officially atheist. The meeting of <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and Ukrainian clergymen at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> hotel, the first official one since Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> crushed the church more than 40 years ago, was kept quiet by both sides. `` The meeting was very warm and fruitful. It gave us much hope and strength,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gel </PERSON>, a lay leader of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> who accompanied the church delegation to the hotel. Members of the delegation said two bishops and three priests of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> met at the hotel with two cardinals from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>: Secretary of State <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, head of the Secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>. Gel said previous contacts were informal, at lower levels, and Friday's meeting would not have been possible without the reforms <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is making in Soviet society. It lasted 90 minutes, three times longer than scheduled, Gel said. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials would not talk about the meeting. Members of the Ukrainian delegation canceled a news conference, saying they had promised not to discuss it further and were returning to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> later Friday. No information was available about whether Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> addressed the issue of Ukrainian Catholics in a letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> brought by <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, the No. 2 <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official. Religious groups must be registered with the government, which puts strict limits on the practice of religion. Officials have not recognized Ukrainian Catholic groups, making their religious services illegal. Officials say the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> numbers 4-5 million believers, primarily in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. It was forcibly assimilated into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946 when <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> consolidated his control over lands captured at the end of World War II. Gel said 11 bishops were imprisoned under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and only three survived to carry on the consecration of other bishops and priests. Bishops <PERSON> Safron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurchaba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pavlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilik </PERSON> led the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> delegation to the meeting Friday, said Gel, who did not attend although he accompanied the group to the Sovietskaya Hotel. The Russian Orthodox Church opposes recognition of the Ukrainian church but has said it will discuss the issue with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> later this month. Others at the Bolshoi said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, dressed in a gray suit and red blouse, sat in the front row of about 80 church and government dignitaries. <PERSON> Schneier </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blushed when he turned from the audience, faced her and said, alluding to the biblical story of creation: `` You have been a trusted and devoted helpmate to your husband. Your presence here is more than symbolic. It shows that as his helpmate you are in sympathy with his cause and in support of his pronouncements on the rights of believers.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he was `` encouraged by reports that there is a new readiness on the part of both churches and the state to face the mistakes of the past, and to seek together to find new ways of expanding the religious rights and opportunities of believers and religious groups within the framework of your socialist society,'' according to a text of his remarks. Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, head of the Russian Orthodox church, called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a `` tireless architect of perestroika and a herald of new political thinking,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported.

 The pieces are coming together and officials here are confident they soon will launch their first space shuttle mission since Challenger exploded nearly 2 -LCB- years ago. Two 126-foot-tall solid fuel booster rockets were hooked up Friday with a huge external fuel tank, and on Thursday the stack will be joined with the shuttle Discovery. The projected liftoff date is Aug. 31. But <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials caution the schedule is tight, with many milestones to be passed. `` The August target is optimistic, for sure, but given where we are today, we've got a shot at it,'' launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. `` We're getting close and there's a feeling of excitement here,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, who as deputy director of shuttle operations will make the decision in the closing minutes whether Discovery should be launched. <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, a veteran of four space shuttle flights, and <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> spoke at a news conference. When Discovery reaches the launch pad, workers will prepare it for a critical flight readiness firing of its three main liquid fuel engines. The 20-second ignition, with Discovery bolted firmly to the pad, will test several modifications made to the powerful engines during the long period the shuttles have been grounded. It also will provide countdown experience for the launch team. Also ahead, on Tuesday and on July 26, are two more full-scale firings of test models of the solid fuel booster rockets at the <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. A faulty booster joint was blamed for the explosion of Challenger and loss of its seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986. Testing of the redesigned booster has gone so well that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was able to confidently assemble here the two rockets for Discovery's flight Assigned to fly Discovery on the mission will be <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, the commander; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, the pilot; and mission specialists <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Union leaders criticized the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> executive for his veto of a bill that would have made the county the nation's first major municipality to regulate video display terminals. `` I'm outraged at the county executive's submissiveness to the business community, whose arguments of the cost of the legislation are innocuous and untrue,'' state <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleary </PERSON> saud Friday. But Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> told reporters that several businesses threatened to leave the county or cancel relocation plans if he signed the legislation. `` In both cases, the consequence would be hundreds, if not thousands of jobs lost, and these are losses that I do not think <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> can afford,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said. Under the bill, employers would be required to pay 80 percent of the cost of eye examinations, glass lenses and frames on a yearly basis, if needed. It also required 15-minute work breaks every three hours and outlined strict work station standards, including what type of chairs should be used, adjustability of the terminals and office lighting. `` This law would cost local businesses millions of dollars to implement at the same time that their competitors in other areas faced no restrictions,'' <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said. `` This would be an economic disadvantage to them of no small consequence.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rechler </PERSON>, chairman of the Association for a <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 40 developers, said after the veto was announced Friday: `` The economy of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has just breathed a sigh of relief.'' The Legislature could override <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>'s veto with 12 votes. The measure was originally approved by 13 of the 18 legislators.

<HEAD>Kitchen Band Entertains Nursing Home Residents With Old Songs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McHENRY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A band of widows low on talent but high on spirit grabbed a few unconventional musical instruments _ a washboard, a soap bottle filled with beans and a teapot _ donned floral aprons, and embarked on a sentimental journey. `` You do n't have to have talent,'' said one of the Happy Tooters, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Widhalm </PERSON>, after a recent performance. `` Almost none of us does. All you have to do is like music.'' At 88, Mrs. <PERSON> Widhalm </PERSON> is the oldest of the Happy Tooters, with the youngest being 62. The 15 women, all widows, perform at nursing homes and retirement villages, choosing their material with people their own age in mind. The songs are traditional, like `` Melody of Love,'' `` Alley Cat'' and `` Peg O' My Heart.'' The orchestration, however, is anything but traditional. The Happy Tooters play kazoos, shake soap bottles filled with beans and croon into the spouts of teapots. Pianist <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Behm </PERSON> play the only `` real'' instruments, but someone occasionally chimes in on the triangle. Like any band worth its gigs, the Happy Tooters have uniforms _ blue floral aprons over white blouses with blue floral bonnets to match. `` I've never sat in the audience, so I do n't know what we sound like,'' said <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, 74, of <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>. `` But we do have fun, and I think we do bring pleasure to people.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, the band's organizer and conductor, said she first organized a kitchen band in November 1985, when her chapter of <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic support group for widows and widowers, was slated to provide entertainment at a dinner in the <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> diocese. The Happy Tooters made their debut March 9, 1986. It was supposed to be a one-shot deal, but the show biz bug bit. They've been touring northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> ever since _ weather permitting `` The ladies are getting up in age,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> explained. `` We try not to peform too much in July and August, when it's hot.'' Cold weather and rain can also be a problem. `` We do n't like to travel when the weather is unstable, we're such a bunch of crips,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said `` But playing for people makes us feel better.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON> pointed out to the elderly and infirm people who were beginning to gather in the activity room at a home before a performance. `` You see some pretty sad faces out there,'' she said. `` It makes us feel good to see them smile.''

<TEXT>
 A federal jury will take the weekend off before resuming deliberations in a cigarette liability lawsuit carried on by the widower of a lung-cancer victim who smoked for 40 years. The jury considering the <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> case ended their fourth day of deliberations about 5 p.m. Friday with no verdict. It will resume deliberations Monday. Jurors asked few questions during deliberations, which began at noon Tuesday. They are considering whether or not to award damages to <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> for the 1984 death of his wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, at 58. During the four-month trial, he charged that cigarette-makers <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> misled the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking and contributed to Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s death. The companies contend she made an intelligent, strong-willed choice to smoke knowing the risks. They argue smoking is not a proven cancer-cause, and that her type of cancer is n't linked to cigarettes anyway. On Friday, jurors asked if the 1984 Surgeon General's report on smoking and health was in evidence and whether they could see it. It was n't, and the judge said they could n't.

<TEXT>
 Authorities have discovered dozens of decaying bodies `` stacked like cord wood'' inside a closed funeral home and dug up the yard outside in search of more. `` We're treating it as a mass disaster right now,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliopulos </PERSON>, chief investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office. So far, 44 bodies have been found inside the Howell Morning Glory Chapel funeral home. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> suspended owner <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s permit to operate a funeral home on Wednesday after the initial discovery of eight decomposed bodies. After the bodies were discovered during a routine state inspection last week, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said he had n't disposed of the bodies either because family members could n't be reached for instructions or because the city had n't given him needed paperwork for indigent burials. The chapel has no refrigeration units. `` At this point, I am convinced that there are no more bodies in the building,'' Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Suber </PERSON> said Friday night after 36 bodies were found. `` We are finished here today.'' However, officials planned to bring in a front-end loader to dig up the yard behind <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION> to search for bodies, The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> technicians who dug up portions of the yard Friday searching for evidence of burials found nothing. But that was not the case inside the building. Some of the bodies found were `` stacked like cord wood in the closet,'' one unidentified official told the newspaper. The bodies on the bottom of the pile, he said, `` were more like skeletons than corpses.'' Meanwhile, of the original eight bodies found, four were buried in the city's indigent cemetery and four were cremated, said <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, chief of the city Welfare Division. One had died July 17, 1987. Three others died in January and a fifth died in April, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. Records could not be found to determine the date of death for the other three bodies found earlier in the week.

 Southern and central Californians were jolted by a strong earthquake that sent rocks flying onto a freeway and closed an aqueduct that supplies half of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' water. Three people in nearby <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION> were injured by a falling avocado tree in Friday's earthquake. One woman was treated at the scene and two men were taken to a hospital for tests. The quake forced the closure of the 440-mile-long <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Aqueduct when power to at least two pumping plants was knocked out. The temblor, measuring 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, struck at 4:06 p.m. and was centered on the <LOCATION> Garlock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>, 11 miles north-northeast of <LOCATION> Gorman </LOCATION>, or about 70 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> said crews worked overnight to reopen the aqueduct and that the city should not face a water shortage. `` For <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> there's no problem, the storage lakes have an ample water supply,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. He said the aqueduct would remain closed at least through today. But he said the <LOCATION> Antelope </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley-East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Water </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was asked to conserve because it had a smaller supply. The quake catapulted rocks onto the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 near the Grapevine, but traffic continued to flow while crews removed the rocks, said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol Officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tejon </LOCATION> station. There were no immediate reports of accidents from the rockslide, he said. `` It was a real violent jolt,'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said. A series of aftershocks also were measured by <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION>, with the biggest measuring 4.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale at 4:22 p.m., said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Geary </PERSON>, a seismic analyst. The Garlock Fault, where the quake struck, is the second-largest fault in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with a length of 200 miles, compared with the 600-mile-long <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andreas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fault </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey seismologist <PERSON> Lucile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 The army ordered a speedup in the judicial review process for some of the 5,000 Palestinian arrested during the Arab uprising in the occupied territories. Defense officials said the new system would benefit detainees by increasing judicial supervision. But Palestinian lawyer <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> today called the move a charade and said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> ordered the changes after all detainees decided last week to challenge the system by filing appeals. About 2,000 Arabs are being held for up to six months without charges, most of them taken into custody since the uprising began Dec. 8. They are called administrative detainees. The army also holds about 3,000 Arabs awaiting trial or serving prison terms on charges of anti-Israeli violence. Underground leaders of the uprising set aside today as a `` Day of Solidarity'' with Palestinian prisoners and called for renewed anti-Israeli protests. On Friday, soldiers bulldozed the cinderblock house of an Arab from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp <PERSON> Jelazoun </PERSON> after he was arrested on suspicion that he stabbed an Israeli-appointed Arab mayor. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, troops expelled about 100 Israelis who were planting olive trees to protest the army's uprooting of orchards and demolition of 14 Arab houses The army measures were in reprisal for an April 6 clash between villagers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> teen-age <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlers in which two Arabs and a 15-year-old Jewish girl were killed. Also Friday, the Government Press Office reinstated the press credentials of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> correspondend <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> after a six-week suspension imposed because he allegedly violated military censorship. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said the changes in the appeals process were ordered because under the current system, the army would be unable to deal with the expected wave of appeals. `` Within the next two weeks, all detainees will have filed appeals,'' <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is going to impose a heavy burden on the system.'' Under present rules, a three-member military committee hears the appeals, and then refers the case to the area commander for a final decision. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> on Friday ordered a military judge to take the place of the review committee and make the final ruling in the case, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said the new system would benefit the detainees by speeding up the appeals process. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted military officials as saying <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also ordered the changes to increase judicial supervision over administrative detention cases. Several weeks into the uprising, the army scrapped a major legal safeguard for the detainees which required that they appear before a judge within four days after their arrest. In <LOCATION> Jelazoun </LOCATION>, the army demolished the home of 26-year-old <PERSON> Khamis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jawdat </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON>, arrested Thursday on charges he knifed Mayor <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, 74, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION> as an act of Palestinian nationalism. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> confessed to stabbing <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, who was recovering at a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hospital. It took about 30 minutes for a big yellow bulldozer to level the three-room house where <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> lived with his 60-year-old mother. An almond tree, a plum tree and a rose <PERSON> bush </PERSON> were left standing in the yard. The army said <PERSON> Faraj </PERSON> was detained several times previously for alleged participation in anti-Israeli disturbances. The tree-planting ceremony in <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION> was organized by the `` Committee for <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>,'' a group trying to force authorities to make reparations to villagers whose homes were destroyed or damaged by the army as punishment. Jewish settlers and the army initially blamed the villagers for the death of Israeli <PERSON> Tirza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> in the April clash, but an army report later determined she was accidentally killed by a bullet fired by an Israeli guarding the group.

 Two Europeans and a Filipino of German descent arrested this week for alleged links with communist rebels have been charged with murder and kidnapping, the military said today. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Galido </PERSON>, chief of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luzon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview the charges were filed by his legal officer Friday before a civil court in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Galido </PERSON> declined to elaborate on the charges but said his command had `` heavy evidence'' against the Rev. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 52, a West German Protestant minister; <PERSON> Stellan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON>, 30, a Swede who says he is a free-lance journalist; and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, a Filipino businessman.

They were being held at the command headquarters in the provincial capital, <PERSON> Lucena </PERSON>, 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

 Police arrested more than 200 suspected gang members in a 1,000-officer sweep that ended this morning in an ongoing effort to rid the nation's second-largest city of gang-related crime. `` We want to reassure the public that we're still committed to solving the gang problem,'' said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON>. `` We do n't want the public to think we've gone away, so we'll run these -LRB- sweeps -RRB- periodically to reassure them,'' he said. `` We're throwing out the big net,'' <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON> added. Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON> said final tallies on the number arrested were not available early today `` but it will be over 200 when we add them all up.'' `` There were definitely a lot of rock cocaine arrests, some arrests for possesion of narcotics for sale, and there were numerous weapons confiscated, including an AK47 assault rifle,'' <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON> said. He said those arrested for serious crimes were held at city jails while those picked up on lesser charges, such as driving under the influence of alcohol, were released. The sweep, the second such police operation in two months, began at 1 p.m. Friday when 1,000 officers fanned out across the city looking for alleged gang members. `` We're going to do it again and again,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> at a briefing before the officers hit the streets. Half of the officers were deployed in the city's gang-ridden <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> area neighborhoods. The last time 1,000 officers were out in force against gangs was on April 8 and April 9 when Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> ordered them to `` take back the streets.'' That sweep netted 1,453 arrests during its two days. <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON> declined to say if the most recent gang sweep would continue again tonight.

<HEAD>Death Toll Nears 100 in Train Blast; Sloppy Loading Blamed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death toll in a Soviet train explosion neared 100 as workers picked through rubble in the city of <LOCATION> Arzamas </LOCATION>, a newspaper said today, blaming the blast on the improper transport of industrial explosives. The force of the explosion made it difficult to determine exactly how many died, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reported, saying the toll `` was approaching 100.'' It added that 200 people were hospitalized and 700 familes left homeless in the industrial city 240 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Shortly after the explosion, a week ago today, the state-run media put the death toll at 73. It rose to 80 on Wednesday. More are missing and unaccounted for, Pravda said. The explosion caused millions of dollars in damages, Pravda said, without giving a specific figure. Investigators have not yet determined what sparked the blast, but it apparently stemmed from improper loading and handling of explosives. It was clear `` the crew did not know what they were carrying,'' wrote Pravda correspondent <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisin </PERSON>. `` The cargo list on the train listed one type of explosive, but in the wagons themselves ... was another more dangerous substance. Worse than that, two types of explosives were placed together in the first wagon, which is categorically forbidden,'' it said. Examination of wagons which did not blow up, Pravda said, revealed `` severe violations of the rules for the transportation of dangerous cargos.'' Detailed reports of disasters were unheard of before <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985 and began the policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater discussion of some formerly taboo subjects

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> carrying 185 people came in on only two of its three engines when an oil warning light prompted the pilot to shut down the third, the airline said. None of the 172 passengers or 13 crew members was injured, and the DC-10 landed one minute early Friday evening at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said airline spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. `` On final approach the pilot encountered a low oil-pressure light. He shut down the engine that the light involved,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. `` It was a perfectly normal landing.'' `` The oil pressure light will be checked out,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. `` Frequently a faulty light causes this. Either it's a bad light or there may be a problem with the engine and that will be fixed, too.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will investigate the incident, said an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional duty officer who refused to give his name. The jet was docked since Flight 79 from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> was the final <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for the day. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said it will be inspected by airline mechanics in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Radical students hurling firebombs attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the prime minister's office today, and student leaders vowed to stage another march to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for unification talks. Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at a back gate of the Combined Central Government Building in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and hurled at least 10 firebombs at the complex. Eight of the attackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteria before they were seized by police. Nobody was injured in the attack in which windows were smashed and a police guard post and a waiting room blackened by flames and smoke. Police said they arrested 18 attackers and that the others fled. The building, across the street from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, houses the prime minister's office, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and other major government departments. Small clashes also were reported today in the provincial cities of <LOCATION> Taeju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> as riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs. No injuries or arrests were immediately reported. The attacks were mounted after riot police blocked thousands of radical students on Friday from mounting a march to the North Korean border for talks on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Fighting began on Friday when police fired tear gas to drive back students who hurled firebombs and battled with rocks and clubs to try and break through to the border. Police officials said today that more than 800 students were arrested in the clashes the day before. More than 100 police and students were injured in the street clashes, they said. About 60,000 riot police were deployed to halt the march to the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. Riot police remained on alert today and troopers guarded key government buildings and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic offices. Radical leaders at a rally today at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the west of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> vowed to mount another march to the border on Aug. 15, national independence day, and said they would not abandon the reunification drive. `` Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who want reunficition of our land,'' one leader said in a speech. About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans. But the students' mood was subdued and thousands of others who had gathered at the campus for the march Friday left overnight. Speakers continued to denounce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. `` Yankee go home'' and `` Reunification,'' students chanted. Radicals claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> so it can rule the south as a virtual colony. A wave of violent anti-American protests has hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the past month. The radicals, who represent between 10 percent and 20 percent of college students, have failed to attract popular support with their reunification campaign. The main opposition parties urged radicals to abandon the march, saying it lacked public support. Most people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fear the totalitarian north is determined to conquer the south. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War and the two nations remain bitter opponents. The North Korean government said its student delegates waited Friday at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for the South Korean students. It denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government, claiming they want to block reunification.

<HEAD>Pro-Government Paper Joins Outcry Over New Press Curbs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A loyal pro-government newspaper today joined the outcry against new press restrictions, and a prominent black moderate pleaded for the release of jailed guerrilla leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The new restrictions took effect Friday when the government reimposed the nationwide state of emergency for a third year. They tighten curbs on reporting about opposition activity and require some journalists to register with the government. The Citizen, a pro-government <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily, joined a wide range of journalists, anti-apartheid leaders and others in criticizing the restrictions. `` There is only one word for the new press curbs and that is overkill,'' The Citizen's editorial said. It said the government appeared to have reached the point where it was barring newspapers from reporting `` matters of vital concern to everyone.'' It added: `` That will mean the public will be uninformed and subject to rumor.' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: `` We observe with irony that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is progressively shutting down the free flow of information at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ frequently depicted here as an enemy of press freedom _ is noticeably moving towards a more open society.'' <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> KwaZulu </ORGANIZATION> homeland and one of the blacks the government would like to draw into a white-controlled power-sharing arrangement, said the extension of the emergency was a tragedy. At an outdoor meeting near <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> also appealed for the release of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who is serving a life prison sentence for his actions as leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. `` Black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not rest until he is free,'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said. `` Nothing the South African government can do will gain it credibility while it treats Dr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as a dangerous enemy.'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> might be the only person capable of ending a bloody power stuggle in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province between militants who support the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and more conservative blacks who follow <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. `` I believe he -LRB- <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> -RRB- would come out of jail to thump anybody ... who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a final black victory over apartheid,'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said. As he spoke, about 70,000 fans packed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> for a 10-hour rock concert honoring <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pledged to cover the extravaganza as a musical, not a political event, its commentator referred to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as `` a political prisoner.'' The South African government threatened this week to expel the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> for its allegedly biased coverage of the government. One of the new restrictions imposed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Friday outlaws advocacy of a boycott of nationwide municipal elections scheduled for October. Most major anti-apartheid groups, including 17 which were banned in February, oppose black participation in elections organized by the white authorities until blacks have voting rights on a national level. The new regulations make it illegal to quote anti-government statements from members of the 17 organizations and prohibit newspapers from quoting any <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members. Another new rule requires local news agencies, except for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, to register with the government. These small domestic news agencies, many of them aggressive in covering anti-apartheid activity, could be ordered to submit their dispatches to a government censor. A group of these alternative news agencies _ the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> _ said the new regulation could be `` the first step on the road to compulsory registration of all journalists ... with the threat of deregistration if they misbehave. The government `` seeks a nation of ignorant, pliant subjects,'' it said.

<HEAD>Prison Population Falls Below Court-Ordered Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city's jail population dropped below the court-ordered limit, allowing the city to hold prisoners unable to raise bail, officials said. The jail population this morning was 3,813, under the 3,850 maximum permitted by the court on weekends and holidays, Bail Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. For other days, the maximum prison population is set at 3,750. Since Wednesday many people, including alleged drug dealers, had avoided jail when unable to raise bail because of the order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> that limited the city's prison population. At the time the jails held nearly 4,000 men and women. The city began freeing prisoners on their own recognizance if they were awaiting trial and had been unable to raise bail of $ 2,500 or less. On Friday afternoon, Prison Superintendent <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said the jails held 3,690 people and that, starting this morning, those unable to raise bail would be held. `` The prison is open and people can be admitted on a regular basis,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said early today. `` The moratorium right now is lifted.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> has termed the jail moratorium `` lunacy,'' charging that city prisons can hold as many as 4,300 inmates. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> called on Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> to seek to have the cap raised or find alternate confinement space. Prisoners who brought the lawsuit charged that <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s prisons were overcrowded They had demanded that each of the city's 3,200 cells should have only one person Excluded from the moratorium are those charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, attempted rape, kidnapping, arson, robbery and aggravated assault in addition to crimes involving use of a gun or knife or large amounts of drugs. Meanwhile, the city moved closer to increasing its cell space by awarding a construction contract for a new $ 165 million Criminal Justice Center. The center _ with jail space for 440 people, plus courtrooms _ is expected to be completed in 1991.

 Former President <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s first socialist president and a strong supporter of workers' rights, died today of complications from heart disease, an official said. He was 89. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, died at his house in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said a party official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The former president had suffered from cardiovascular problems for years. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> became the fifth president of the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1964. After he left office in 1971, he served as president of his party. In 1922, at the age of 24, <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but left <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after Fascist dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> came to power the same year. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then in 1926 to <PERSON> Saint-Gaudens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He returned to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> after the Italian armistice with the Allies in 1943 and was arrested for anti-Fascist activity. He escaped, was recaptured and escaped a second time together with <PERSON> Sandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrini </PERSON>, who also later became president. In 1946, <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> became president of the <ORGANIZATION> Constituent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that framed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s republican postwar constitution. He broke with the Socialists in 1947 and helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which later became the Social Democrat Party. As secretary of the new party, <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> built it into a staunchly pro-Western and anti-Communist leftist force. He was later elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> four times as a Social Democrat and championed radical reforms in housing, medical care, education and taxation. `` The republic loses in <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> a central figure in the fight against fascism and Stalinism,'' said Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> was born September 19, 1898, in the northern industrial city of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>. He obtained a university degree in economics and commerce. While a bank clerk, he wrote for a newspaper and turned out political books. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON>, who was fond of Roman philosophers, was known for his gentle and easy-going manner. He was so relaxed about politics that he often put its difficult maneuverings second to lively literary conversation on his favorite authors, <PERSON> Goethe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON>. He once told a political leader who had waited for a long time to see him: `` I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long, but I was engaged in a talk with -LRB- Nobel Prize-winning poet <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> -RRB- Quasimodo. Poetry should come before politics sometimes, do n't you think?'' Saragat is survived by a daughter, <PERSON> Ernestina </PERSON> <PERSON> Santacatterina </PERSON>, and a son, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>. A funeral was scheduled for Monday.

 A county prosecutor said he would investigate the fatal shooting of a Hispanic man by an off-duty police officer, and for the first time in three nights this industrial city was relatively quiet. Some people drove by police and yelled insults at them Friday night, witnesses said, adding that police yelled insults back. However, unlike Wednesday and Thursday nights, there were no incidents of violence reported. Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Otlowski </PERSON> and Hispanic leaders hammered out an agreement in a three-hour meeting with <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON>, less than 24 hours after about 1,000 rioters clashed with police following the funeral for the slain man. <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said after Friday's meeting that his office will investigate the shooting and present the case to a county grand jury. The two sides also agreed to form a commission to investigate bias in the city of about 39,000 and to form a community council to hear grievances about police conduct, he said. `` Most of the people here really want justice,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fatima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where the funeral for the slain man was held Thursday. `` But they also want peace in our town. `` A lot of what happened last night was because when crowds get big there is not a lot of control,'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said Friday. Terms of the agreement were printed and distributed in the city's Hispanic community Friday. The population of <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amboy </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, is evenly divided between whites and Hispanics. The earlier violence was touched off when off-duty narcotics officer <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> shot and killed <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coria </PERSON> and critically wounded <PERSON> Coria </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Matteo </PERSON>, outside a bar early Monday. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he fired at the men because he believed his life was threatened by <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coria </PERSON>, who he said approached him holding a bottle. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> was suspended with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.

 About 5,000 people jammed St. Vitus Cathedral today for the consecration of two assistant bishops, the first such Roman Catholic appointments allowed by the communist government since 1973. After the ceremony, hundreds of people shouted slogans such as `` Long Live Father Cardinal!'' `` Long Live the Pope!'' and `` We Want Religious Freedom!'' outside the palace of Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, the head of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, officiated at a two-hour ceremony to mark the formal appointment of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebeda </PERSON>, the 75-year-old Vicar General of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and 64-year-old priest <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Liska </PERSON> as assistant bishops of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Their appointment should lighten the workload of the 88-year-old Cardinal. Papal emissary <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> officials from neighboring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were among those attending the majestic ritual in the cathedral. <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> later shook hands with those who rallied outside <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s palace.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON>, a veteran anti-apartheid campaigner, today kicked off a 10-hour rock concert honoring <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> by calling on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to release the black leader from prison. <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON>, speaking to 70,000 fans at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, gave a brief but stirring message to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> on his upcoming 70th birthday. <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> a symbol of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s `` cruel and unjust system of apartheid,'' and said: `` We want to see you and your fellow political prisoners freed.'' Cheers and a chorus of `` Happy Birthday'' rose from the mostly youthful throng. The British rock star Sting then began the peformance, which organizers said would be seen on television by 750 million people in 60 countries. Although the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pledged to cover the extravaganza as a musical, not a political event, its commentator referred to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as `` a political prisoner.'' The South African government threatened this week to expel the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> for its allegedly biased coverage of the government. Organizers said the concert, modeled on the 1985 Live Aid `` global jukebox'' for African famine relief, launches a five-week series of rallies and celebrations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> leading up to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday on July 18. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was among eight <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders sentenced to life imprisonment 24 years ago today for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government. He has since become <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most prominent political prisoner. About 40 pop stars and groups _ including <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> _ were to perform on a huge stage at the north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stadium. The <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> organizers say half the proceeds from the $ 45 tickets will go to seven children's charities in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the rest will fund its activities in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Six hours of the concert was to be telecast in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today by <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>, the Los Angeles-based network. The concert has been denounced by the South African government and by right-wingers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who claim that by televising it, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> is violating its duty to be impartial. A <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> statement said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> is not paying for broadcast rights and views the concert purely as `` an outstanding international musical event.'' Published reports said that when a message from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> smuggled out of Pollsmoor Prison in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> is read to the crowd, cameras would cut from the stage to interviews. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 25 lawmakers in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signed a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> motion saying the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> was violating its rules by giving `` publicity to a movement that encourages the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in its terrorist activities.'' `` You can only say it is a political event because he -LRB- <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> -RRB- is a political prisoner,'' countered Archbishop <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Huddleston </PERSON>, the main organizer of the show. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> embassy complained to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> `` at the highest level'' about broadcasting the concert and hinted it might expel <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> reporters. That complaint follows one on Thursday by South African Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> who said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> might be ordered out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of a film it broadcast in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this week about detained black children in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> is billed as the concert's guest of honor. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government Scheduled performers include <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Masekela </PERSON>, Dire Straits, <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION>, Simple Minds, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, the Bee Gees, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>, Fat Boys, <PERSON> Ashford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dammers </PERSON>. There were to be several big-name surprise singers, raising a rash of speculation in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s tabloid newspapers.

<TEXT>
 In a victory for anti-abortion groups, Presbyterian leaders have urged a change in the denomination's pro-choice position, while others struggled with a major church statement on nuclear weapons A subcommittee today continued revising `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' a paper that has been criticized by groups within the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- who say it improperly glorifies civil disobedience and resistance to government policies. Abortion and nuclear weapons were among the controversial issues being debated during the nine-day meeting of the 3-million-member church's 200th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which ends Wednesday. On Friday, full committees of the assembly adopted a wide-ranging statement on religious freedom, including recommendations that pastors give up their tax exemptions for their housing allowances, and adopted a paper titled `` Is Christ Divided?'' which complains that special interest groups have split the denomination and calls for more serious theological discussion of issues. A committee Friday called for a change in the church's position on abortion and a new study of the issue, but supporters of the denomination's generally pro-choice position say they expect a floor fight on the question. The assembly is scheduled to consider the matter on Tuesday. Presbyterians Pro-Life, a sanctioned organization within the denomination, wants the church to condemn abortion in all instances except where the mother's life is in danger. <ORGANIZATION> PPL </ORGANIZATION> co-sponsored an appearance by Nobel Peace laureate <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> in a rally before the convention began Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> PPL </ORGANIZATION> hoped <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s reputation and staunch anti-abortion stance would persuade commissioners to approve a new study, or a change in church policy. Currently, the Presbyterian group opposes abortion as a method of birth control, but says the decision rests with a woman in consultation with her doctor and her conscience. Also Friday, the 18-member <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obedience </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee retained language in the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obedience </ORGANIZATION> paper that calls nuclear war immoral, but changed a section labeling the theory of nuclear deterrence immoral. T. LaFontine `` Fountain'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, an elder from <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said the subcommittee revised the paper to say `` nuclear deterrence as an end in itself'' is immoral. In addition, the subcommittee deleted recommendations calling on local church groups to provide financial and moral support to those who resist the government through tax protest and civil disobedience. But the subcommittee left in recommendations calling for creation of a voluntary Fund for Obedience to a High Authority `` for the assistance of those who suffer financial loss or difficulty as a result of acts of conscience.'' Many conservatives have blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obedience </ORGANIZATION> paper and past social policy statements for the denomination's membership decline. There were 2,976,937 church members in 1987, a decline of 154,191 since 1983, when the denomination was formed from two Presbyterian groups that had split during the Civil War. The denomination is almost 14 times larger than the second-largest group, the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Mandatory Drug-Testing Proposed for Interstate Truck Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Teamsters union official says mandatory drug testing of interstate truck and bus drivers is unreasonable and resembles a politically motivated `` witch hunt'' by federal highway safety officials. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> `` will fight this all the way,'' said R.V. <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, the union's safety and health director. The Teamsters represent 200,000 truckers nationwide. <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> responded Friday to a highway safety proposal by Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> for drug testing of up to 5 million drivers of interstate trucks, passenger buses and vehicles hauling hazardous materials. `` We must act to identify those commercial drivers who abuse drugs and get them off the roads,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference here. `` When one drugged truck or bus driver goes out on the road, he not only puts the lives of many people in danger, he gives the entire work force a bad reputation.'' But <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said Teamster drivers are the safest and most responsible in the trucking industry and called the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> proposal a `` witch hunt'' and `` a politically motivated move to beat up on truck drivers.'' <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> said that Teamster truckers were already subject to drug testing as part of their biannual transportation department physical exams, and also if there was probable suspicion of substance abuse. `` Random testing is an unreasonable and unjustifiable violation of a person's right to privacy. We believe government-mandated random testing is unconstitutional,'' <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal was the latest in a series of department efforts to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s transportation network safer. In March, the drug testing program was proposed for the aviation industry. In May, the railroad industry was targeted. There are no firm statistics to indicate how many of the nation's truck drivers are drug abusers, he said. But he cited a June 1987 test of 317 tractor-trailer drivers in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> that showed 15 percent of the drivers tested positive for marijuana, cocaine and prescription stimulants. The proposed rule would cover 3 million to 5 million people who drive commercial motor vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, vehicles that transport 16 or more people or vehicles that transport hazardous materials. School bus drivers and intercity bus drivers would not be affected by the proposal, he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the effort but expressed concerns about how the tests would be implemented.

 A group trying to take a convoy of truckloads of aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has again been stalled at the border in a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Trreasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over trade restrictions on the Central American nation. `` They have gone back on what they said,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Silk </PERSON>, a spokesman for Veterans' Peace Convoy. `` We are back to square one.'' The group already is three days behind schedule. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials met late Friday with representatives of the group. `` Last night they told us we would be forced to sign a statement of intent stating essentially that we the convoy are wrong, we are guilty of breaking the embargo law,'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillete </PERSON>, a convoy participant, said early today. `` Our lawyers are not at all happy with this proposal.'' <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs worker in <LOCATION> Houton </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> KTSA </ORGANIZATION> radio in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> the meeting was held to pass out papers to be signed and go over guidelines. About 100 convoy members have been camped here since Wednesday when <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials informed them that the trip would violate trade restrictions imposed on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1985. Violation of the regulations can result in fines of up to $ 50,000 and prison terms up to 10 years. Some 30 tons of food, clothing and medical supplies would be allowed for humanitarian purposes, the government told the convoy members, but their 37 vehicles could not be left in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said the group would have to apply for an export license, post cash bonds equal to the value of the trucks, cars and buses, and give assurance the vehicles would be returned to this country within 30 days. On Friday, Customs officials told the group they would not seize their trucks if bonds were not posted. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Friday afternoon that <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> had not changed its position. Organizer <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said the group planned to leave vehicles in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but never intended to be out of compliance with the law. The convoy began May 21 from different regions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and arrived in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on Tuesday. `` We have baby food going bad in the 115-degree temperature down here,'' <PERSON> Silk </PERSON> said. `` We are angry, tired of being toyed with.'' <PERSON> Gullette </PERSON> said the group `` will do everything to avoid violence, but at the same time the convoy believes in civil disobedience when appropriate.'' Convoy members say they are being harassed because of their opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid for the rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are simply following standard procedures.

 Former soldiers loyal to deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> ransacked a military armory today but failed to free soldiers jailed for involvement in past coup attempts, the military said. Also today, the military said it filed murder and kidnapping charges against a Swede, a West German and a Filipino of German descent who were accused of taking part in a rebel raid in February. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the former soldiers fled with 24 stolen M-16 rifles when guards fired at them as they tried to free some of the 160 people, mostly soldiers, detained at suburban Camp Crame. He said his troops were ready for the attempted rescue of the prisoners because of intelligence reports earlier that `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists'' would try to rescue <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, a former assemblyman close to the former president, and other detainees. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> has been jailed for more than a year on charges of masterminding the killing of several followers of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during the campaign for the February 1986 presidential election. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was swept into power and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was deposed during the campaign. The military, meanwhile, said charges were filed in a <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> civil court Friday against the Rev. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 52, a West German Protestant minister; <PERSON> Stellan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON>, 30, a Swede who claims to be a free-lance journalist; and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, a Filipino businessman of German descent. The three, arrested Wednesday, were accused of taking part in a raid by communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on a town southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in February in which two people were killed and two soldiers abducted. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> linked participants in today's raid on Camp Crame to <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON>, a pro-Marcos former major involved in a failed coup attempt in January 1987. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> based the conclusion on the attire of the raiders, who wore black hoods, fatigue pants, black t-shirts with `` Black Forest Commando'' insignias and red arm bands. Military units were placed on alert throughout the nation today but officials said the move was not related to the Camp Crame incident. They said it was a routine measure to prevent any disruption of celebrations on Sunday _ the 90th anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> Constabulary spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cris </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said the Camp Crame raid began at 4 a.m. with the renegades riding in a white van and a car that apparently were parked inside the camp the day before. It was not clear whether the raiders stayed overnight inside the camp, the constabulary's national headquarters. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said most likely they slipped in one by one during the night. He said the renegades first ransacked the armory of the constabulary's brass band and proceeded to the jail compound where they were spotted by sentries who fired on them. The renegades immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief firefight by soldiers near the camp's gym, <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said. He said an undetermined number of renegades were believed hit in the exchange. There were no casualties on the government side. <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON> said one soldier stationed at the raided armory was being questioned for possible links to the raiders. At least 34 detainees at Camp Crame are accused of involvement in at least five coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government. Soldiers linked with <PERSON> Cabauatan </PERSON>, who remains at large since the Jan. 27, 1987 failed coup, also attempted to free soldiers jailed at suburban <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, in April 1987. One of the renegades was killed in the incident and the others surrendered after an eight-hour siege. At least 17 inmates, also facing coup charges, escaped but eventually surrendered or were recaptured.

 Highway patrol and sheriff's officers today searched for dozens of children who fled a Baptist boarding home after a judge granted the state temporary custody following allegations of mental and physical abuse. About 80 of approximately 140 children living at the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children in <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> remained at large, police said late Friday. State officials said they would work over the weekend trying to reach the children's parents and guardians. Youth Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> issued the order at 11 a.m. Friday, saying there was probable cause to suspect physical and mental abuse at the home. Minutes after he issued the order, Welfare Department personnel arrived at the home. But in the meantime, the youths apparently were alerted and most had fled. `` We were told they were allowed, if not encouraged, to leave the campus, and some of the children said they were told to run,'' said state Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>. Some of the children, ages 8 through 17, were found in private homes, restaurants and walking along the streets of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. About 60 children were taken to dormitories on the campus of the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Whitfield </LOCATION>, he said. They were undergoing physical examinations. After the decision was made to house the children at the hospital, parents began calling the hospital, state hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Wynona </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. Welfare Department social workers, she said, told parents how to get to the hospital, how the children were and answered other questions. Many of the youths were angry as they were taken into custody. `` You have no right, I want to be here with my people,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 16. `` I do n't want to be here with all the rest of you people who hate the truth. You better check yourself and make sure you are not burning on the way to hell.'' Officials were unsure how many children lived at the home because its operator, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, refused to provide a list of residents, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. Fountain, along with several other ministers from the fundamentalist church who flocked from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to support him, claim such boarding homes are protected from state regulation because of the constitutional separation of church and state. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> issued the order following a weeklong hearing on a request by <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities. The hearing stemmed from an investigation into a child who ran away from the home and refused to return, claiming he was physically abused. In court papers, the youth, identified only by his initials, said he was `` tired of being locked up, slapped and getting licks all the time.'' He told social workers he was denied medical and dental treatment during his 19-month stay at the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> home. Authorities have not charged anyone at the home with abuse but are still investigating the allegations, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. Telephone calls to the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> home were not answered late Friday. The judge ruled that according to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s Youth Act, the children were being held in a detention home rather than a boarding home. Detention facilities are required to notify the state of children placed in their custody. Fountain was jailed for two days for refusing provide a list of residents. But he was freed Friday without turning over the roster after agreeing to an orderly transfer of the children to state custody. When Welfare Department officials arrived, Fountain was already at the home, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` We did not encounter any cooperation from him there. In fact, it was just the opposite,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said, declining to elaborate. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he was unsure whether any action would be taken against Fountain. The court order gives the state 48-hour temporary custody of the children, in addition to custody today and Sunday. Welfare officials hope to locate and return the children to their parents, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. `` We have information that some folks are trying to help the kids escape out of state,'' he said. Based on his experience with the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> Home for Girls near <LOCATION> Hattiesburg </LOCATION>, where about 100 children were taken into state custody in 1986, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he believed the children's parents would be scattered throughout the country.

 Thousands of people filed past the coffin of <PERSON> Josep </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON> today in a final salute to one of the few remaining figures of the ill-fated 1931-1939 Spanish Second Republic. <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON>, who became the first head of the restored Catalonian regional government in the post-Franco era, died Friday in this northeastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> city from complications of a chronic lung ailment. He was 89. Spanish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said by midmorning police estimated 3,000 people had filed past <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON>' glass-covered coffin draped with the red-and-gold-barred flag of the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON> lay in state in the Palace of the Generalitat, the seat of the regional government. The regional government declared three days of mourning for <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON>, one of the founders of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> in 1931. A government spokesman said a funeral Mass would be held Sunday in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION> with burial later that day in nearby <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coloma </LOCATION> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervello </PERSON>, his hometown. <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON> served as a minister of the regional government of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. He went into exile when the rebel forces of Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> defeated troops loyal to the Second Republic. When <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> he vowed never to set foot in his native region again until Catalonian autonomy was restored. As the Spanish transition to democracy began upon <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death in 1975, he sought to restore the autonomous government of the four-province northeastern region of <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION>. King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> appointed Tarradellas provisional head of the Catalonian government and he returned to <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> Oct. 23, 1977, where huge crowds were on hand to welcome him home. <PERSON> Tarradellas </PERSON> retired two years later and lived with his wife, <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON>, who survives him.

 The early version of a Star Wars anti-missile defense ca n't be deployed until at least 1998, and even then would cost more and offer less protection than the administration admits, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> report issued by three senators said Saturday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been pushing for development of a `` phase one'' version of the program, but it `` is not going to get off the ground, either militarily or fiscally,'' the 110-page report said. The report was written by the majority staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations committee and was released by three members of the panel, Sens. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. It was the second major criticism in the past five days from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. Last Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the highly sophisticated computer software needed for Star Wars might fail. The <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report also said an American Star Wars defense could easily be thwarted by the Soviets, and would likely set off a new U.S.-Soviet space arms race. The senators' criticism focused on SDI's so-called phase one, which involves construction of an early version of the system. Star Wars researchers are looking at a variety of exotic technologies, including lasers, to use as a missile defense, but phase one envisions using existing, ground-based rockets and orbiting `` garages'' of space-based rockets to fire at attacking <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year that deployment of a phase one system could begin by the mid-1990s, and would cost between $ 75 billion to $ 150 billion. But the senators' report disputed those estimates. `` A significant phase one deployment can not occur before 1998 at the earliest, with a full operational capability after the turn of the century,'' it said. Costs could be as high as $ 171 billion, and could approach $ 750 billion when combined with a later, phase two program, it said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report said, a phase one system would intercept less than 16 percent of the expected <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear warheads. The senators noted that ongoing U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms control talks are aimed at reducing each superpower's arsenal of long-range weapons by 50 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report `` contains more misleading assertions than facts.'' It specifically disputed the estimate that only 16 percent of expected Soviet warheads could be intercepted. The SDI office said the military estimates, while classified, are `` considerably greater than 16 percent.'' Of the 1998 target date, the SDI rebuttal said `` congressional cuts to the SDI budget have slowed our progress ... We are working within congressional budget constraints to achieve the means for effective strategic defenses at the earliest possible moment.'' The senators' report agreed with the OTA assessment that the Soviets could easily counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shield. The phase one system `` likely would be obsolete the day it is deployed,'' the report said. `` Technical challenges and the evolving Soviet threat will severely degrade its effectiveness.'' The Pentagon is `` underestimating <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> political and military resolve -LRB- to counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense -RRB- and overestimating the difficulty of Soviet countermeasures,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> document said. The report called for overhauling the SDI program to emphasize research into promising new technologies, rather than development of existing systems. It noted that `` while the president's vision of SDI would substitute strategic defenses for nuclear deterrence, <ORGANIZATION> SDIO </ORGANIZATION> has yet to describe any system, phase one or otherwise, that would effect such a substitution. Phase one would only reinforce nuclear deterrence.'' It also suggested that `` unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to substantially incrase funding every year for SDI, there will not be enough resources to carry out a phase one research program while simultaneously funding an energetic effort for promising new technologies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are now trying to decide how much to spend for Star Wars in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The current Star Wars budget is $ 3.9 billion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought $ 4.8 billion, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted $ 4.6 billion while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 3.5 billion. A <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> will decide a compromise figure.

 Biopsies have been taken of tumors found in Pe-Pe, the father of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s giant panda family, the director of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> zoo said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chapultepec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview Friday that the biopsies were taken Thursday to determine if the tumors are malignant.

<HEAD>West German Company To Pay Millions To Nazi Forced Labor Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the largest industrial conglomerate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will pay $ 11.7 million to victims of Nazi forced labor programs and their families, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials announced. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> makes cars, buses and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> luxury automobiles, while its wide-ranging subsidiaries also include a major aerospace manufacturer. Like other German companies during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich, <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> used forced laborers to fuel the Nazi war effort. With the payment, <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> joins other major German companies who have paid reparations to former forced laborers and their families. In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $ 2.9 million to slave labor victims. Other West German firms, such as the giant <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> concern, a major weapons producer during World War II, also have paid reparations. The announcement of <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION>'s payments follows a lengthy study the company commissioned to determine the extent to which forced laborers worked in its plants nearly a half century ago. Thousands of workers died from ill-treatment or were murdered in concentration camps if they were no longer able to work. The German <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, in a telex statement to the news media on Friday, said it expected to receive $ 2.9 million from the automaker to distribute to forced labor victims in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, said a total of $ 11.7 million would be paid by <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> to `` those affected and their family members.'' It was not immediately known who would receive the rest of the money, but the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said in the telex to news media that the donations were all intended for victims and their families living outside <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> officials have scheduled a news conference for Monday, at which they were expected to announce further details of the payment plan. They declined to give details of the payment program on Friday.

<HEAD>Close Presidential Race Likely As Dukakis Runs Strong In GOP
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is off to a strong start in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and other longtime Republican strongholds in his race against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although a closely contested presidential election seemed likely, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. The 50-state survey indicated widespread optimism among Democrats that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can end eight years of Republican rule in the White House. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials in many states said the contest shapes up as a tight one, but several said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could win easily if he succeeds in his attempt to depict <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an heir to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s liberal past. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads in the polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which last voted Democratic in 1964, and is running even with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the polls in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which gave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his largest majorities in 1980 and 1984. One survey shows him running even in reliably Republican <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and within striking distance in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, key Southern states. `` I think it will be the closest presidential contest we've had since 1976,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairman in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> has n't voted for a Democrat in a presidential campaign since 1964, but <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have a candidate with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unique popularity. That's not to knock <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Nobody else has got that kind of popularity either.'' Said Democratic Chairwoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchioro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, `` This is the best shot we've had in a long, long time.'' The last time a Democrat carried her state in a presidential election was 1968. Republicans have won four of the last five presidential elections, with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s victory in 1976 the only exception. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads in nationwide puiblic opinion polls, there is agreement that political fortunes in the five months until the election will be influenced by factors such as selection of a vice presidential running mate, campaign debates and the health of the economy. Republicans believe that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead is a temporary result of favorable publicity over the past several weeks generated by his string of primary victories against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Nobody has laid a glove on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and he has n't been burdened with the traditional baggage a northern liberal carries with him,'' says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> GOP party director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Denny </PERSON>. `` That's going to change once the conventions are over. We have n't been able to start hitting on him.'' For now, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' double-digit lead nationally is reflected in poll results around the country and optimism among Democratic officials in states from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. _ He leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a double-digit margin in polls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He is also viewed as the leader in both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which last went <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, which last voted that way in 1964. _ Polls in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> indicate the two men are running even. Neither state has backed a Democrat in a presidential race since 1964, and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials in both states express confidence that wo n't change this time. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> holds leads in polls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is well within striking distance and officials in both parties say the race could be influenced by vice presidential running mates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is perceived as running generally well across the South. `` I sense a strong base of support for Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' in the South, says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` But Republicans in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> realize how close this election can be.'' Officials of both parties agree that the vice president also has to contend with weaknesses in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that were exposed during the primary season. `` If the election were held today, I think <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would stand a good chance of winning <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' where a Democrat last won in 1964, said the state's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahaffey </PERSON>. As is often the case, the large industrial states _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> among them _ are viewed as key battleground states, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems to hold the early advantage in each of them. No matter what the polls show, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes make it certain to be the biggest battleground of all. Most officials believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds an advantage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the second largest state with 36 electoral votes. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` the strongest <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate'' to run in the state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s base also gives him a good shot at <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and Democratic officials say the three <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states shape up as closer than usual. `` No matter what the polls look like this is going to be a close election because the vice president has an advantage in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>,'' says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager. He says that in states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West there are `` 210 or 220 -LRB- electoral college votes -RRB- easily available for the vice president. ... The problem is the other 50 are going to be difficult.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' communications director, says the Democrat intends to stage raids in normally secure Republican territory. `` We can win electoral votes in every region of the country,'' he says. It takes 270 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes to win the presidency. The race could be heavily influenced by the vice presidential selections. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey, which relied on polls and contacts with party leaders or independent political analysts in all 50 states, turned up little enthusiasm for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the Democratic ticket, in keeping with polls that indicate that such a pick would lose support. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received plenty of advice to look to a Southerner such as Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a Westerner or perhaps <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> to fill out his ticket. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't pick a Southerner, it just makes it that more difficult for us,'' said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. On the Republican side, the name of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> came up frequently as talk turned to holding his state in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> column. Former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> also was mentioned by several as a good Southern choice. Whatever the preferences, the polls indicate the importance of a vice presidential selection. A survey in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a margin of 48 percent to 41 percent over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But if <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were to join the ticket, the survey shows the race would narrow to essentially even. Similarly, a recent poll in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a lead of 53 percent to 40 percent over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the vice president would fare far better if <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> joins the ticket.

<HEAD>Agency Would Ease Tax Strain for Some Government Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal agency, seeking to make high-level government service more attractive, is recommending some officials be permitted to postpone taxes on profits resulting from property sold to avoid a conflict of interest with their public duties. The Administrative Conference of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meeting Thursday and Friday, proposed the deferral of tax liability in cases where the incoming official re-invests the proceeds of the sale in mutual funds. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to change the tax laws to permit this. The conference, a permanent independent agency established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to improve the working of federal agencies, proposed that the tax postponement be available only in cases specifically requested by the president. Under current law, officials who are forced to sell off property because they might present conflicts of interest, must pay any capital gains taxes during the year of the sale. `` You should n't have a tax penalty to become a public servant,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Fielding, a former <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel who chairs the conference's special committee on ethics in government. The conference also recommended that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sign an executive order that later this year would require members of the incoming president's transition team to agree in writing to a code of conduct. During the 1980-1981 presidential transition `` over 600 persons, most serving as volunteers, had active assignments on agency transition teams,'' the group said. While it has no knowledge of any abuse, the group said, so many people dealing with federal agencies `` offers the potential for conflicts of interest or abuse of the public trust that accompanies their special access to government information and facilities.'' The proposed conduct code for transition employees, most of whom are not paid and do not join the government, would prohibit them from using, disclosing or permitting others to use for private gain any information they obtained in their temporary roles.

<HEAD>Catastrophic Health Bill Would Increase Income Tax For Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The catastrophic-care bill awaiting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signature will mean the biggest expansion of a federal health program in a quarter century but carries a less-welcome surprise for millions of elderly Americans: a big income tax increase. For many Medicare recipients, the increase would more than wipe out the gain won when the tax system was overhauled in 1986. The tax increase would kick in for 1989 income for anyone who is eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. It would start by adding 15 percent to regular tax next year, jump to 25 percent in 1990 and then rise by as much as one percentage point a year thereafter, conceivably reaching 35 percent by the end of the century. This tax increase would pay for about two-thirds of the cost of protecting <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> recipients against catastrophic hospital, physician and drug expenses; the program would cost an estimated $ 33 billion over the next five years alone. The remainder of the cost would be covered by raising the monthly Part B premium paid by recipients for doctors' services. Thus, those who benefit from the expanded program would pay the entire cost _ at least for the near future. `` We have not asked our children to pay the medical bills that we incur,'' said Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` These benefits will be paid for by the men and women who will use the coverage.'' But even some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who voted for the bill worried aloud that as the tax burden on the elderly grows, pressure will mount to have other taxpayers share the cost. The compromise bill cleared by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week is considerably more generous than the version recommended by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Nevertheless, there is no indication that the president will veto it, even with the tax increase. Sponsors of the bill are reluctant to use the term `` tax increase.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly referred to it as `` a new income-related premium. Negotiators who wrote the final version of the bill decided that paying for the expansion solely by raising the Part B premium would have made it prohibitively expensive for lower-income people. The final compromise, said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., `` takes into consideration an individual's ability to pay for this protection and in doing so allows this coverage to be more affordable for low-income beneficiaries. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> estimates the average tax increase will be $ 285 per person in 1989 and $ 506 in 1993. The bill includes several restrictions on how the tax would be applied:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ It would hit only those people eligible for Medicare -LRB- generally age 65 or older or disabled -RRB- whose incomes are high enough that they already pay at least $ 150 income tax Typically and elderly couple with adjusted gross income of $ 11,000 or less would not be subject to the increase. Congressional staffers estimate that in 1989, about 40 percent of Americans over the age of 65 would have to pay the tax increase. A private organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, estimates 46 percent next year and 56 percent by 1993. _ The maximum tax would be $ 800 per person in 1989 -LRB- $ 1,600 for a couple if both spouses are eligible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, rising to $ 1,050 -LRB- $ 2,100 per couple -RRB- in 1993 _ The tax will be at a rate of $ 22.50 for each $ 150 of regular income-tax liability in 1989; by 1993, $ 42 per $ 150 of liability According to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a couple with $ 21,000 adjusted gross income and taking the standard deduction would face a tax increase of $ 236 in 1989 and $ 441 in 1993. At $ 31,500 income, the increase would be $ 473 next year and $ 882 in 1993. On the average, taxpayers with incomes between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 were given a $ 220 tax cut in the 1986 tax overhaul; those between $ 30,000 and $ 40,000 averaged $ 273. The increase in the monthly Part B premium required by the bill would be the same regardless of income. In 1989, the $ 27.10 premium would rise to $ 31.10, and by 1993 would be $ 42.60 a month. Backers of the bill acknowledge that no more than 7 percent of the elderly and disabled who are eligible for Medicare would benefit from the bill, even though all will have to pay the Part B increase and many will face the new tax. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, compared the bill to fire insurance. `` Not everybody is going to have a catastrophic illness and not everybody wants to have a fire either,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` but what you are paying is an insurance premium that takes the law of averages and applies it to the individual, with the fervent hope that the vast majority never have the need to use this benefit.''

<HEAD>Ship Loaded with 10,000 Tons of Ash Reported on Way to Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A ship that has been unable to unload its 10,000 tons of ash for 20 months is headed for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where public anger is rising at industrial nations trying to dump wastes. The <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is en route to the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and from there it will go to an undisclosed destination in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said its operator, the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. In a June 3 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> was proceeding `` under reduced speed'' to the islands west of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> to await further orders. The company said it had a representative in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> negotiating for the discharge of the ash, which came from city incinerators. The Organization of African Unity has called plans by developed countries to dump their wastes `` a crime against <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and Africans,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental group said in a report last week that shipping waste to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was a growing trend. `` In particular, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have become the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers from industrialized countries,'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said. On Thursday, Guinean officials announced that they had jailed a Norwegian official and several Guinean employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> for bringing 15,000 tons of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> ash into the country. `` If the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is planning to go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, if these guys are thinking of marketing their material there, their timing is way off,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Christich </PERSON>, an official in the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s international affairs office The Khian Sea left <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in October 1986 loaded with about 15,000 tons of incinerator ash. It has been rejected by the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>. It unloaded about 4,000 tons of ash in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> before being ordered out of the country. It returned to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on March 1 with the intention of taking the ash back to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. But negotiations broke down with the contractor who was to dispose of the ash, <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paolino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, and the ship left May 22. In March, <ORGANIZATION> A.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulkhandling </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> shipping company, said it had taken 15,000 tons of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> incinerator ash to <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> to be used in making construction material. The ash was dumped on the island of <PERSON> Kassa </PERSON>, off the Guinean coast. By May, the Guinean government formally requested that the ash be removed. Bulkhandling officials tried to convince the government that the ash was not harmful, but it was not convinced and set a May 20 deadline to remove the ash. The ash was not taken away, and on Thursday, the government announced that <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s consul general had been arrested for complicity in the secret dumping of what it called 15,000 tons of toxic waste from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ibrahima </PERSON> <PERSON> Sory </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaby </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Guinean </LOCATION> secretary of state for security, said the waste was shipped from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. City officials have said that the ash is not harmful.

<HEAD>Candidates Long On Promises, Short On Specifics To Cut Deficit</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both talk of eliminating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit in four to five years, but outside economists suggest their intentions may be better than their arithmetic. Analysts not aligned with either camp suggest that plans forwarded so far by both the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominees-to-be fall far short of pointing the way to a balanced budget. `` It's the 1988 edition of voodoo economics,'' said economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, using the term coined by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 1980 to criticize <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` supply-side'' contention that budget savings could flow from tax cuts. The plans of both candidates contain as major elements features that private economists find dubious: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claim that he can make a major dent in the deficit by simply beefing up tax-collection enforcement, for example, or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention that his election would cheer financial markets and drive down interest rates by two percentage points, thus saving billions in interest payments on the $ 2.5 trillion national debt. Both candidates say they'll put a high priority on trimming the budget shortfall, which was $ 150 billion last year and a record $ 221 billion the year before. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims he can eliminate it in one term. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> generally speaks of closing the gap over five years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has long since shedded his reservations about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies, also is calling for a `` flexible freeze'' to keep overall federal spending from growing faster than the rate of inflation, with an exemption for Social Security benefits Within that freeze, some programs would rise and others would be cut. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't say what he would cut, and he has n't been clear on what he would increase, either, beyond suggesting that education programs, AIDS research and drug enforcement would get more attention under a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has also proposed a long-range health plan and a college-bond savings program, which together could cost the government upwards of $ 500 million a year. He also proposed reducing the capital gains tax to 15 percent from its current rate of 28 percent and disputes arguments by many economists that it would cost the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> revenues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has repeated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s long rebuffed calls for a constitutional balanced-budget amendment and authority to veto individual items in spending bills. The vice president, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before him, insists he would not raise taxes. `` Absolutely not, period,'' he says. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he wo n't rule out new taxes as a possibility but has been vague on just how he'd trim the deficit. He says he'd like to do it without new taxes. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor says he hopes to reduce federal red ink in annual installments of about $ 30 billion. He talks about `` hard choices'' on spending. But, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he wo n't say exactly which programs he'd chop. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suggested in general terms that he would cut defense spending to help pay for elderly care. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also hopes to trim the deficit by stricter enforcement of tax laws and with a program of amnesty for tax cheats, which he suggests could save a total of $ 90 billion over a five-year period, an amount private analysts suggest is wildly optimistic. Both candidates' hopes for wiping out the deficit are based on rosy assumptions of continued economic growth. While both say they will not cut automatic Social Security benefit increases, both are counting on an anticipated surplus in the Social Security trust fund in the years ahead to help offset red ink in other areas, at least on paper. Both candidates have been deliberately obscure when it comes to additional details, particularly on spending reductions. `` Both of them are doing the right thing right now and that is keeping their mouth shut,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Choate </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who says that neither candidate yet has made serious proposals to deal with the deficit. `` To bring our fiscal and monetary policies into balance internally and with each other and with the rest of the world, we're going to have to do some tough things in 1989 and 1990.'' Spell those tough things t-a-x-e-s, adds <PERSON> Choate </PERSON>, who says there's little likelihood that the budget can be brought close to balance without new levies. `` To the degree that the presidential candidates and their aides get out and get into the fight over specifics, every time they bring up a specific and get into a fight over it, that's an option they lose. It's a sad reality, but we're better off if they do n't say much,'' <PERSON> Choate </PERSON> said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the school of business at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said neither candidate has yet presented a realistic deficit-reduction plan. `` There are only two ways to eliminate the deficit: one is to cut spending, two is to raise taxes. Those are the only two ways,'' said <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>. `` But from a political point of view, you ca n't get elected by telling people you're going to cut what they get from the government by $ 150 billion or by telling them you're going to raise taxes either.'' Any effective program of cuts must pare deeply into so-called entitlement programs, direct government payments to individuals. Democrats in the past have championed such programs. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to broaden his appeal to women, minority groups and blue-collar workers, has recently been talking of giving more attention to social programs such as child care, health care for the elderly, education and training for dislocated workers. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> said that of the two candidates, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for a freeze `` is a somewhat more concrete proposal,'' although not a new idea, and probably not a concept that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would buy. Besides, he said doubts that a freeze plus inflation alone would enable revenues to catch up with spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan has an added element, revealed in recent sessions with economic advisers. This is the assumption that financial markets would react favorably to his spending-freeze proposal, and send interest rates tumbling by at least two percentage points. Such a drop in interest rates would dramatically lower what the government must pay in interest on the national debt, payments that now are running at just over $ 200 billion a year. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic forecasting service based in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, calls this idea far-fetched. `` Why would the market respond favorably? That's ridiculous The market is not stupid. The market knows you ca n't get to where you want to get to by taking taxes and Social Security off the table.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Offers Upbeat Assessment of Economic Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in an upbeat assessment of the upcoming seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, said that the world economy is in better shape now than it has been for any of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s previous seven summits. Because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do n't want to upset financial markets in the midst of a presidential election campaign and because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies would prefer to wait and deal with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor, few new policy initiatives are expected during the session. In an interview late last week, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said that he wo n't let widespread reports that he's about to leave his post to join <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican presidential campaign distract him from giving his full attention to the economy The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary said there was `` no chance'' that any decision would be made in the coming week before the summit. Republican sources have said they expect <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to resign sometime this summer to help run <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. The economic summit, the 14th in as many years, provides a forum for the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to map out strategies to promote world growth. But because the world economy is doing surprisingly well at present, world leaders see no reason to launch any grand new initiatives at the three-day meeting, which begins June 19. Economic growth has accelerated, stubborn trade imbalances have finally begun to narrow and the dollar, after a dizzying, three-year plunge, has stabilized. `` I think the world economy is in the best shape that it has been in going into any of the eight economic summits that I have attended with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at the end of last week during a relaxed interview in his office. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, considered one of the president's savviest political strategists, served for four years as White House chief of staff before taking the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> job in early 1985. He said that the drive he began in September 1985 for closer international economic coordination among the summit countries, known as the Group of Seven, had helped the major industrialized countries withstand the shock from last October's stock market collapse. `` The Group of Seven countries in the aftermath of that event refused to turn inward. They continued to cooperate closely ... to spend an extraordinary amount of time conferring by telephone, with the result that some rather major remedial actions were taken,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said that interest rate reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, trade adjustments in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the two-year federal deficit reduction pact reached last December in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had all helped to calm financial market jitters and set the stage for accelerating growth. `` We have a coordination process which has been tested by the adversity of the stock market crash,'' he said. `` I think the markets are becoming convinced that the G-7 is unified and that we are acting in a coordinated and cooperative way.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said this renewed confidence had led to an increase in foreign private investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. In 1987, the flow of private funds, which had been helping to finance the federal budget deficit, almost dried up. Foreign central banks filled in the gap, but <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there was evidence that the amount of central bank purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt had fallen to roughly one-fourth of what it was a year ago. The administration is hoping to use <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell summit to spotlight some of the president's favorite themes, including the need to cut tax rates and eliminate government regulations to spur free market enterprises. `` This summit hopefully will recognize the contribution the Reagan-Bush administration's policies have made to world growth, policies which were derided when they were first proposed at the initial summit in 1981,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Most of the major countries are now moving wholeheartedly toward free-market economic policies such as deregulation, privatization and tax reform.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is a close friend and adviser of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and Republican sources have said that the administration is already reviewing a short list of possible successors. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, a Wall Street investment banker who is also a close confidant of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has emerged as a leading candidate to succeed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Right before last year's economic summit in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, the administration made a surprise announcement that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> would be replacing <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON> and there had been speculation that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s resignation and replacement would similarly be announced before the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> flatly rejected that scenario and turned aside all efforts to gauge when he might leave his <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> job to join the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` I am not going to sit here and speculate with you on something that may never happen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Radicals Stage Firebomb Attack On Government Building</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Radical students hurling firebombs stormed a major government building Saturday and grappled with riot police after security forces blocked a reunification march to the North Korean border. Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at the huge Combined Central Government Complex in the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, which houses the prime minister's office, the foreign ministry and other major government offices. Students smashed windows and damaged a police post and a waiting room in the complex with firebombs, police said. The complex is across a main road from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. Eight attackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteria in one building and hurled firebombs at riot police before being seized. No injuries were reported. Police said 18 students were arrested. `` Punish the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo government!'' and `` Fight for unification!'' the attackers screamed. The students have accused President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of repressive and undemocratic tactics aimed at keeping <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> separate from the communist North and allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The students launched the raid after the government on Friday blocked their plans to march to the North Korean border for talks with northern student delegates on reuniting the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said students rallied Saturday in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, to denounce the suppression of the march. The report, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, gave no attendance figures. It said <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ung </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, head of the North's student delegation to the planned border talks, vowed to continue a `` persistent struggle'' for the meeting. South Korean riot police firing tear gas battled students hurling firebombs and rocks in fierce street clashes Friday after the government blocked radicals' attempts to march the 30 miles to the border. Police said Saturday that more than 800 students were arrested in the clashes and more than 100 police and students were injured. Radical leaders at a rally Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> vowed to mount another march to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> border on Aug. 15, the national independence day. They said they would not stop their struggle for reunification of the peninsula, divided since 1945. `` Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who want reunification of our land,'' one leader said in a speech. About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans. But the students' mood was subdued, and thousands of others who had gathered at the campus for the march Friday left during the night. Speakers continued to denounce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. `` Yankee go home!'' and `` Reunification!'' they chanted. Radicals claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> so it can rule the South. A wave of violent anti-American protests has hit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the past month. Small clashes denouncing the blocking of the march were reported in the provincial cities of <LOCATION> Taeju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Riot police firing volleys of tear gas dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs. The hard-core radicals _ who are often joined in protests by more moderate sympathizers _ represent no more than about 10 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> college students and have failed to attract wide popular support with their reunification campaign. Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian <PERSON> North </PERSON> is determined to conquer the South. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War and the two nations remain bitter enemies. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who took office Feb. 25 after elections in December, has liberalized debate on unification but said the government, not students, should lead any dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A funeral was planned Sunday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for a radical student who died June 6 after setting himself on fire in a ritual protest. Three students have killed themselves in protests since May 15. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, dissidents sometimes use suicide as a way to call attention to their demands.

 Iranian gunboats today attacked and set ablaze a British-flagged tanker off <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and fired rocket-propelled grenades at an American-chartered freighter in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, sources said. The raid on the freighter left one crewman dead and two injured. The British-flagged tanker, the 258,979-ton <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demetia </ORGANIZATION>, was set ablaze at 6:05 p.m. southeast of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil port of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanura </PERSON>, according to gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not known if the attack by two Iranian gunboats or the resulting fire caused casualties aboard the Esso Demetia. Four hours earlier, two Iranian gunboats attacked the 11,744-ton West German vessel Dhaulagiri 300 miles to the south as it sailed into <PERSON> Hormuz </PERSON>, the waterway connecting the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. The freighter was manned by a crew of five Germans and 14 Filipinos, the sources said. The seaman who was killed took a direct hit, but it was not known whether it was from a grenade or machine-gun fire, they said. Two crewmen were injured by shrapnel from the rocket-propelled grenades, the executives said. A man with a Filipino accent was heard radioing from the freighter for assistance. `` He was begging, almost crying for helicopter assistance to remove the wounded,'' said one executive who monitored the radio call. An Omani patrol boat later carried the injured to a hospital, they said. The executives said the freighter was punctured with holes, but no fire broke out. It was heading for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dammam </LOCATION>, they said. The vessel was chartered by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, to carry containers of cargo to Arab ports in the gulf. The freighter's engine was not damaged, and it was expected to go to the <LOCATION> southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for repairs, the sources said. The Iranian attacks were their first in two weeks and the fifth and sixth since May 3, when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> broadened its protective role to non-U.S. flagged vessels in the gulf. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes shattered a two-week lull in the `` tanker war'' by attacking a salvage tugboat, the 742-ton Singapore-flag Salverve. The raid killed two seamen, shipping officials reported. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported another <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raid hit a `` large maritime target'' off the Iranian coast. But there has been no independent confirmation of that raid. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, at war since 1980, have attacked more than 500 merchant ships in the gulf since early 1984. More than 300 seamen have been killed.

<HEAD>Report Says Students Criticizing American Radio</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency said Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students are accusing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-supported </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> demagoguery </ORGANIZATION> in its reports on recent student unrest. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the network denied the charge. The harshly worded report by the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which has a large audience in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, had become a target of student criticism. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted one unidentified physics student as saying <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> had blown the situation on the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus out of proportion. He said the radio reported falsely that a student was arrested in a brief sit-in at Tiananmen Square last Wednesday. It said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> gave a false impression by saying police had charged students to disperse them. Police on Wednesday closed off the square to thwart a planned pro-democracy rally by students. About a dozen students tried to stage a sit-in on a sidewalk off the square but police stopped them. Police said one man was detained, but he was not a student. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasting network, said in a statement Saturday that `` the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> rejects the charge of demagoguery or anything resembling that.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said the network `` carefully sourced and verified the events'' before reporting them. He said <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> will continue to provide accurate information `` about events which affect them daily, including calls for democracy and freedom.'' The June 2 murder of a graduate student at the university ignited campus protests first of lax security and later of poor living conditions for intellectuals and the slow pace of democratic reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Dozens of posters, some criticizing the government, were put up and 1,000 students have gathered on a campus square each night to debate political issues and whether they should hold demonstrations. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted a student as saying <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> is overly interested in bad news about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Therefore, I suspect it has the desire to see <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plunged into chaos,'' the student said. A law student reportedly asked, `` Is the radio not trying to make the situation worse?'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media have criticized <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> for its reports on nationwide pro-democracy student demonstrations in December 1986 and January 1987. The network said its reports were balanced. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts in Chinese, English and 42 other languages, is a major source of information for students trying to find out what is happening on campuses throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>CAMP DAVID, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his official retreat at Camp David: My fellow Americans, in one week, I go to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> for the annual economic summit with the leaders of the major industrial democracies The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with our strong allies _ <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ form the industrial and technological backbone of the free world. This will be my eighth and final economic summit, and there'll be much to celebrate Perhaps foremost will be the worldwide economic revolution that has unleashed ever greater levels of prosperity with lower tax rates. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> led the way with major tax cuts and tax reform, and the other major industrial democracies have either cut their tax rates or are now in the process of doing so. I'm proud to say that we now lead the world with the lowest top personal tax rate of any of the major economic powers. We're also leading the way in creating jobs, providing employment for a greater percentage of our labor force than any of the other major industrial democracies. In fact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment is at its highest level ever, and we've also brought down inflation and interest rates It's not surprising that country after country has followed us on the path to greater economic freedom and begun to replace their statist policies with deregulation, privatization and freer trade. One of the great lessons of the last seven years is that when people in free economies are allowed to trade with one another around the world, the result is greater prosperity for us all. Certainly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been one of the biggest gainers in the global economy. You've probably heard that we're now in the longest peacetime economic expansion in <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> history. But this is also the first economic expansion in the post-war period in which the <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> economy has grown faster than most of its major trading partners. So, yes, we're doing particularly well. But when free countries trade and invest with one another, there are no losers _ only winners. Today we have a global economy in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is at the very center. Of total foreign direct investment in the world, nearly 40 percent, by far the largest share, consists of Americans investing overseas. But it's not a one-way street. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also receives more foreign investment from abroad than any other country. So we truly are the investment capital of the world. The same thing is true regarding trade. We import more and export more than any other country on Earth. With that in mind, I want to re-affirm my commitment to enactment this year of responsible trade legislation. To help achieve positive trade legislation, I've directed my senior advisors to stand ready to assist the congressional leadership on a new trade bill, one that will strengthen <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s international competitiveness and create even more new jobs for Americans. And make no mistake _ the global economy is the basis of our prosperity and the foundation of our economic future. I can think of no surer way of derailing our economy than to try, through protectionist measures, to seal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> off from trade and investment with the other countries of the world. I'm reminded of the story of the Sunday school teacher who asks her class who wants to go to heaven. Well, all of the children raised their hands except for one little boy in the back of the room. The teacher, astounded, says, `` Charlie, do n't you want to go to heaven?'' `` Sure, I do,'' he says, `` just not with this bunch.'' Well, fortunately, we and our trading partners are going to deal with economic matters together, because that's the only way to move ahead. I'm glad to say we're moving away from protectionism and toward greater economic growth and job creation. One of the historic events of our time is the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement that I entered into this year with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. This agreement between the world's two greatest trading partners will eliminate tariff barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by the year 1999, and establish the largest free trade area on earth. The advantages to both our countries will be enormous in terms of jobs and prosperity. But as much as this path-breaking agreement does for the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, this agreement, looked at in the sweep of history, is truly a gift to the world. It creates a model that can be imitated and expanded, and ultimately made universal among free nations. And that's something we can truly be proud of And finally, Tuesday is Flag Day, the anniversary of the first official <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I hope that you'll join us and millions other Americans Tuesday evening at 7 o'clock, Eastern Daylight Time, in the annual `` pause for the pledge.'' Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

<TEXT>
 The Russians are coming, and the men and women of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> 487th Tactical Missile Wing are preparing to show them what few Americans have seen _ 112 cruise missiles. The missiles and their camouflaged launchers, positioned at this base in remote southeastern <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, are stored under tons of earth and concrete and surrounded by four rows of chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. Soviet inspectors will arrive sometime after July 1 to count the missiles and launchers to be eliminated under terms of the superpower Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty, which went into effect June 1. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told visiting reporters Friday that over the next three years, the missiles and launchers will be sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and destroyed under the eyes of Soviet inspectors. `` Exactly when they are going, or how they are going, I am not at liberty to say,'' he said. <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON> said the plan is to send the missiles to the <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors will monitor the elimination of intermediate range missiles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON> said inspection agency officials are working quickly to make sure everything is ready for the Soviets, who can make their first visit between July 1 and the end of August. `` We have had a very short time to recruit and train inspectors and escorts. It has been a very extensive effort. We have conducted mock inspections, testing different scenarios,'' said <PERSON> Wagovich </PERSON>. Two Soviet reporters already have visited this high-security base. They came Friday with other reporters from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Soviet and East-bloc journalists have also been shown missile bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Western reporters visited a Soviet base in the northern republic of <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> on June 3. During the visit to <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> demonstrated how the launchers are raised and prepared for action. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> did not allow reporters to see a cruise missile. Each of the mobile launchers can fire four 21-foot missiles that can deliver a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead 1,500 miles at almost the speed of sound. The atomic bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in 1945 had an explosive force of 20 kilotons. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials, citing security reasons, declined to discuss the number of warheads at Comiso or their total destructive force. The Italian government agreed in 1982 to take the missiles, and <PERSON> Comiso </PERSON> became the second base in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to accept cruise missiles. The first were located at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate that the base _ a mostly treeless 379-acre expanse of asphalt, sun-baked earth and brown and beige stucco buildings _ pumps $ 18.2 million a year into the local economy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Italian officials said no decision has been made on how to use the base once the missiles have left or on what to do with the 1,750 American and 179 Italian military personnel. Americans first came to this base 45 years ago. On July 11, 1943, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops commanded by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> captured the Axis airfield after Allied bombers hammered the base. Six days later, Allied fighter planes began to use the air base.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Saturday denied allegations that it is violating a U.N.-sponsored accord on the Afghan war by aiding Afghan guerrillas. It also claimed that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had made forays into its airspace and territory. `` The allegations made by the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> side were rejected, and a point by point reply has been handed over to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Pakistani official said the reply `` emphasized ... that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> can not be held responsible'' for guerrilla actions against the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is also not expected to prohibit the legitimate political activity of the Afghan refugees who represent a substantial segment of the Afghan population,'' the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> sponsored an accord calling for withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of the Soviet troops helping the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> government in its 10-year-old war with anti-communist guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed the accord in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> repeatedly has charged that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the agreement, which took effect May 15, by continuing to arm guerrillas. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> made the same charge at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which supports the guerrillas, is partly to blame. In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have armed the guerrillas during their struggle to oust the Afghan government. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said as a result of the alleged violations, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be obliged to review the nine-month schedule to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Pakistani spokesman also said there had been air and ground violations of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> territory by the Afghan government and called this `` a serious breach'' of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord. It did not elaborate on the alleged intrusions. The Pakistani statement was given to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The mission undertakes inspections when it receives complaints of violations of the accord. It has offices in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Nearly 3 million Afghan refugees fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> following the Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The bulk of the refugee population remains in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> because of the fighting.

 It's a simple toy conceived when a stonemason watched a group of children playing with sticks, pencils and empty thread spools. But since their introduction 75 years ago Sunday, Tinkertoys have found their way into millions of toyboxes, chemistry labs and even industrial drawing boards. `` It's a classic,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wager </PERSON>, who oversees the annual toy quality report from the liberal political action group Americans for Democratic Action. `` There are not too many toys that have been around for three or four years _ let alone 75.'' Tinkertoys were introduced at the 1913 American Toy Fair by inventor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajeau </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, but it was a year before they caught on. In a 1914 publicity stunt so successful it halted traffic while motorists gawked, <PERSON> Pajeau </PERSON> hired midgets to dress up like <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s elves and play with Tinkertoys in a window of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, according to `` A Toy is Born,'' by <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> Since then, more than 100 million Tinkertoy sets have found their way to the young and young-at-heart. Chemistry professors use them to make molecular models, <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> uses them to test management candidates and <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> used them for design models. Still, `` it's the children who continue to make the toy popular,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>, spokesman for Tinkertoy manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>. `` It's a great toy because kids can use their imagination with it and build anything they want,'' said <PERSON> Wager </PERSON>, of the Washington-based lobby group. `` They can take it apart and build something different with it 10 minutes later.'' A youngster in 1913, 87-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Myrtle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> remembers playing with Tinkertoys when they were first introduced. `` We used to make cars and houses and everything,'' she said. After watching her children and grandchildren grow up playing with them, she says: `` It keeps the kids busy and they enjoy it. It keeps them quiet.'' While Mrs. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and others may feel sentimental seeing their offspring play with the familiar toy, nostalgia does n't carry much weight with today's youngsters. `` Little kids are pretty savvy,'' <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> said. `` If they have done everything a toy has to offer the first few times they play with it, it will stay in the toy box. But if you provide a toy that's going to challenge them every time they use it, that's the toy you're going to have to pick up after them every time they play.'' And what do children make with the multicolored wooden sticks and spools? `` It could be nothing, it could be a helicopter, it could be the Eiffel Tower,'' said <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>. Whatever it is, it `` gives them a sense of accomplishment,'' he said. Tinkertoys have n't changed much over the years. First introduced in metal canisters, they were sold in boxes for a time until last year, when <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> returned to the original packaging, he said. In 1983, plastic pieces were added to allow for more construction possibilities, said <PERSON> Charness </PERSON>. First marketed by The Toy Tinkers of <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, the toy changed companies several times until 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> acquired Tinkertoys as part of a purchase of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Playskool </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Sets of Tinkertoys come in four sizes, beginning at about $ 5.99, <PERSON> Charness </PERSON> said. Imitators have developed over the years, but Tinkertoys continue to hold their share of the market, selling about a million sets a year, he said. Although new to the Tinkertoy tradition, the world's largest toy maker celebrated Tinkertoys' 75th birthday last week with a 4-foot-high, multitiered birthday cake _ made of Tinkertoys.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday that he is looking forward to the economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and warned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to `` try through protectionist measures to seal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> off from trade and investment with the other countries of the world.'' In his weekly radio speech, delivered from the presidential hideaway at Camp David in the western <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> hills, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated his pledge to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reshape the trade bill that he vetoed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sustained the president's veto on Wednesday. `` Make no mistake, the global economy is the basis of our prosperity and the foundation of our economic future,'' the president said. `` I can think of no surer way of derailing our economy than to try through protectionist measures to seal <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> off from trade and investment with the other countries of the world.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., said in the Democrats' response that the trade bill was needed `` to put our economic ship of state back on course `` We ca n't continue to follow the course set by this administration,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. `` We've seen our position as the world's largest creditor nation erode to that of the largest debtor. We continue to run historic trade deficits.'' `` The plain and painful fact is that without any incentive for reciprocity, many of our trading partners are using our outdated assumptions to take advantage of us,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said. The president will meet with leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> on June 19-21. `` This will be my eighth and final economic summit, and there will be much to celebrate,'' he said. `` Perhaps foremost will be the worldwide economic revolution that has unleashed ever greater levels of prosperity with lower tax rates,'' he said. He said that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had led the way in tax cuts and market-oriented economic policies and that the other industrialized democracies had followed. `` It's not surprising that country after country has followed us on the path to greater economic freedom and began to replace their statist policies with deregulation, privatization and freer trade,'' the president said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described the free trade agreement reached by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> last year as `` one of the historic events of our time.'' The agreement is designed to eliminate trade barriers between the two countries by the end of the century. `` This agreement, looked at in the sweep of history, is truly a gift to the world,'' he said. `` It creates a model that can be imitated and expanded and ultimately made universal among free nations, and that's something we can truly be proud of.'' Turning to his dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I want to reaffirm my commitment to enactment this year of responsible trade legislation.'' `` To help achieve positive trade legislation, I have directed my senior advisers to stand ready to assist the congressional leadership on a new trade bill _ one that will strengthen <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic competitiveness and create even more new jobs for Americans,'' he said

 While six jurors decide a lung-cancer victim's damage claims against three cigarette-makers, the defense is gearing up its public relations engine. Each day the jury deliberated last week, a public relations firm for two of the defendants reserved satellite time for a package of background videotape, expert commentary, graphics on 30 years of tobacco cases and live interviews with lawyers. The material is intended for use on television stations. The federal lawsuit waged by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> over the 1984 death of his wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, at 58 has drawn heavy media coverage, and the tobacco companies have waged a major public relations offensive throughout the 4 -LCB- - month trial The jury deliberated last week for four days, beginning Tuesday. It took the weekend off and will return to the case Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are accused of misleading the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking through advertising, public relations and inadequate research. Anti-smoking advocates have hailed the trial as a gold mine of bad publicity for the $ 22 billion industry because of dozens of confidential company documents presented as evidence. The documents spoke of a `` gentlemen's agreement'' not to conduct cancer research, of an industry `` strategy'' to create `` doubt about the health charge without actually denying it,'' of a research program designed `` so that -LRB- the -RRB- results can not harm'' the industry. The companies say the documents were taken out of context, that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> freely chose to smoke knowing the risks and that smoking is not a proven cancer cause. On hand almost every day for damage control during the trial were five public relations experts, including three from the <ORGANIZATION> Daniel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> firm, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and arranged for the satellite feed. A lawyer also was present to answer reporters' questions. After <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney delivered closing arguments, a spokesman at the courtroom door handed out a news release containing the lawyer's statement. `` This is, by everyone's admission, the most critical case, the one that attracted the most attention'' among tobacco liability suits, said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> Senior Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricke </PERSON> said the satellite feed is partly a solution to the large number of requests for interviews from television stations. `` One of the problems we have is, win or lose, our side historically has n't gotten a lot of play, especially in the electronic media,'' he said. The feed will include live interviews with tobacco trial attorneys to discuss the legal issues and arguments, according to an advisory sent to television stations. A Wall Street analyst on tape will discuss the impact of the verdict on the tobacco industry, and a legal expert will talk about the `` implications of such suits for society.'' Television stations also can receive footage of cigarette production and of stacks of industry documents provided to <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys. Neither <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ricke </PERSON> would comment on the cost of the feed, which is being produced by the business television division of <ORGANIZATION> Visnews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a TV news agency. A satellite company official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reserving eight hours of satellite time averages about $ 5,000, not including production and distribution costs.

 A former governor fighting to defeat a state lottery initiative for the second time in as many years has picked up an unlikely ally _ representatives of the state's multimillion-dollar gambling industry `` They just happen to be on the same side that we've been on since the proposal on lotteries has started,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, a former congressman who was <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> governor from 1972 to 1980. `` I do n't think it's ironic.'' Lined up in opposition with Link, who opposes a state lottery as a regressive tax on poorer citizens, are charities that are allowed to run casino gambling in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The proposal's primary backer predicts the measure will succeed this year, helped by increased public awareness of flourishing lotteries in neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` Good God, we're the only one left,'' says <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION> businessman who is spearheading the pro-lottery effort. Twenty-six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> are operating lotteries, and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are scheduled to start them this summer. Voters in neighboring <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> are to decide in November whether to allow one. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the only state that has voted down a state-run lottery. Voters will cast ballots in Tuesday's primary on whether to approve a state lottery, which is now banned by the state Constitution. The state's voters first rejected a lottery almost a century ago, after gambling interests attempted to bribe the Legislature into starting one. The constitution was changed recently to allow `` public-spirited organizations'' to run gambling casinos, and more than 300 groups, ranging from humane societies to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> posts, offer bingo, blackjack and other games to benefit a variety of charities. North Dakotans spent $ 189.2 million on charitable gambling last year, and once prizes, taxes and allowable expenses were deducted, charities netted slightly more than $ 17 million in 1987, according to the most recent attorney general's report. Critics contend a lottery would lure away the discretionary cash <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakotans </LOCATION> now use for bingo and blackjack and thus hurt the charities. `` It could have a direct effect on the organizations that are trying to continue to fund their programs,'' said R.S. <PERSON> Guilderhus </PERSON>, executive director of the Fargo-based <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. A lottery could conceivably drain away 70 to 80 percent of the $ 500,000 in annual gambling proceeds his foundation now spends on services, <PERSON> Gilderhus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Satran </PERSON>, director of the Home on the Range for Boys near <LOCATION> Sentinel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Butte </LOCATION> in extreme western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, said about 15 percent of the ranch's private donations come from fraternal organizations that raise money from gambling. `` I think those -LRB- lottery -RRB- dollars would be diverted from what is being spent on charitable gambling now,'' he said. King estimates a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> lottery would gross $ 20 million annually, with half of that sum returned to players as prizes. Of the remainder, $ 7 million, or 35 percent, would go to the state general fund; 10 percent would pay for lottery expenses; and 5 percent would go to vendors as commissions. `` It would be that much less that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would be in your pocket for,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said of the projected $ 7 million in proceeds. `` And it's a voluntary tax. It's up to you whether you want to do it or not.'' Link, a longtime friend of King, contends a lottery amounts to a regressive tax on lower-income people and that its benefits would be outweighed by its potential social costs. A lottery also represents a step beyond the existing charitable gambling industry, said Link. `` This changes the role of government completely, in that it puts the state government as the official promoter,'' <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. `` The state ... is encouraging its own citizens to buy into a game of chance where most of them have to lose. That's not the role of state government.''

<HEAD>Automobiles' Success Its Undoing, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The automobile was once an efficient way to get around but now causes such traffic woes and health hazards that people must learn to use other transportation methods, said a study released Saturday.. `` Excessive reliance on cars can actually stifle rather than advance societies,'' said the study by <PERSON> Worldwatch </PERSON>, a private think-tank The study estimated the number of passenger cars in use worldwide grew from 53 million in 1950 to 386 million in 1986. As a result, motorists in hundreds of cities creep forward at speeds slower than a bicycle's, the study said. It said that more than 200,000 people died in 1985 in traffic accidents worldwide. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, some 30,000 people die each year of diseases resulting from the use of gasoline and diesel fuel, the study said. `` It is time to build a bridge from an auto-centered society into an alternative transportation future ... in which cars, buses, rail systems, bicycles and walking all complement each other,'' the study said. It said governments should discourage auto use where possible, require cars be made more fuel efficient and less polluting, expand public mass-transit systems and encourage affordable housing near jobs. In the long run, moving urban patterns away from the sprawl generated by the automobile is a solution, the study said. `` What people need is access to jobs, homes and services,'' the study said. `` More compact and integrated communities can provide such access without long commutes.''

 An amnesia victim who walked into a pizza parlor six weeks ago and said `` Help me, I do n't know who I am,'' now faces a new identity crisis. `` I've gotten lots of calls saying I'm two entirely different people,'' said the man, who dubbed himself <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after he was taken to a homeless shelter in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s ordeal began May 3, when he woke up beside railroad tracks and Interstate 64 near where the borders of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> meet. `` I woke up in a field and the first thing I thought was ` It's cold.

Once, when asked to sign his name, he started to write the letter P, `` and then I forgot The only name right then I could think of that started with a P was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, so maybe my first name is <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. I do n't know,'' he said. He said he thinks he was born Jan. 1, 1948, which would make him 40, but doctors say he might be in his mid-30s. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has occasional flashbacks, `` but they go so fast he ca n't understand them.'' He remembers military installations, such as <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. And he remembers places in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Mission workers asked <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> newspapers to publish the man's photograph, and on Friday he was inundated by calls from people claiming to know him. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not recognize any of the callers, although some of the details they provided matched the few pieces he has to his puzzle. One group of people who saw <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s photograph told him they believe he is <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, 33, who frequently vanished for months at a time `` on a whim.'' <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>' stepmother, stepsister and brother-in-law all talked to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the telephone `` and they seem convinced that's who I am.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the family could provide few details, `` so I'm not so sure.'' Another <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> resident said he recognized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawper </PERSON>, 40, a career <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man. The caller knew several little-known naval bases that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> remembers, `` and the knowledge of history and geography, that matches. But he said the last time he had seen <PERSON> Shawper </PERSON> was 11 years ago in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shawper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> both attended the same college in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. One has been married two or three times, the other once. `` So I'm either an educated responsible man or an educated irresponsible man,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't be both, that's for sure. One of them has to be wrong. They both may be wrong.'' He said he is being cautious until his fingerprints are checked Monday against those of <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shawper </PERSON>. Doctors at a local mental health center who see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> twice a week say that since he suffered no physical trauma, he might have suffered an emotional one. `` So I'll remember and I wo n't like what I remember, or I wo n't ever remember and I wo n't like that, either,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said It is not a pleasant choice, `` but I would prefer to be me,'' he said. `` There are nights when I lie awake at night thinking, and there's nothing to think about.''

 Diabetes and its complications cost the nation some $ 20.4 billion last year, with about $ 10.8 billion resulting from lost productivity and the rest from medical bills, says a study released Saturday. Direct health care costs included $ 6.9 billion for inpatient hospital care, $ 1.7 billion for outpatient care such as doctor visits and medications, and $ 942 million for nursing home care. The disease, its complications and related issues accounted for more than 11.5 million days in the hospital, said the report by <ORGANIZATION> Pracon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a research and consulting firm in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. It was presented at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s annual scientific meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. In all, the report estimated, 6.5 million Americans had diagnosed cases of diabetes in 1987. Other studies have shown that about 5 million more Americans have the disease but do not know it. The study estimated that nearly 565,000 new cases of diabetes were diagnosed last year, and that the disease contributed to an estimated 201,000 deaths. In diabetes, the body does not produce or properly use insulin to control blood sugar levels. Complications of diabetes can severely damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves.

 Supporters and critics of Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> scuffled Saturday during rival demonstrations before the black Anglican leader embarked on a trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At least one black man, a supporter of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, was taken into custody, and police ordered all members of the public to leave the main hall at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Jan Smuts Airport. About 100 of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s supporters remained in the hall and chanted the archbishop's name when he arrived on a connecting flight from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Police and clergymen escorted <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Leah </PERSON>, through the hall as his supporters, most of them black, cheered. Many white onlookers stared in amazement. He gave a final wave to the crowd before entering the international departure area to catch a flight to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He is to fly to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday to join ecumenical celebrations of the 1,000 th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church About 15 anti-Tutu protesters _ including a few blacks and a white woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishop's costume _ assembled at <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smuts </PERSON> with placards denouncing the archbishop's support for sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> One poster termed <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Puppet,'' while another said: `` Red Carpet for <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> _ Red Bombs for Us.'' It was the fourth airport protest against <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> since he returned three weeks ago from a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. During that trip, he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a means of promoting racial reform. Saturday marked the first time during the series of protests that anti-Tutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of the archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of white domination. The altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed an anti-Tutu poster and tore it. Police announced over the public address system that the arrival hall should be vacated, but many people _ including members of the rival protest groups _ remained. When <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> arrived, about 45 minutes after the scuffle, one woman cursed him but few of his other critics were visible. Participants in the earlier anti-Tutu protests have included whites from right-wing organizations and jobless blacks recruited by conservative black politicians. All the protests have been filmed and shown on the national television news by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which frequently denounces <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has described sanctions as one of the few non-violent means of pressuring the government to end apartheid, under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. Sanctions could be avoided, he says, if the government dismantled apartheid and moved to grant the black majority full political rights. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s critics contend that sanctions will result in higher black unemployment while hardening the attitudes of pro-apartheid whites. These critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions, but there is no means of verifying this. Endorsement of sanctions is illegal under emergency regulations, and blacks are not allowed to vote in national elections or referendums. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said this week that the anti-Tutu protests were being `` orchestrated ... to give the impression that there was mounting protest against anti-apartheid groups.''

 A dissident said Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in civilian clothes beat and threw protesters to the ground while breaking up an unauthorized demonstration by dissidents demanding the release of political prisoners. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said at least 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> opposition political group were dragged away and detained 15 minutes after the protest began Saturday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> were extremely rough,'' <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman, said in a telephone interview. `` They threw people to the ground, and beat one woman so badly that people became indignant.'' Western journalists at the scene said young men in civilian clothes dragged the demonstrators off the square. A week ago, a demonstration was held in the same square but was not interrupted. The protesters Saturday, said by <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> to number about 100, had gathered to call for the release of <PERSON> Valeriya </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotvorskaya </PERSON>, 38, who was detained at 6 a.m. Friday at her <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment. The philologist and library worker, one of the founders of the fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of taking part in an illegal demonstration on April 15. Other members of the group say she has a history of heart problems and is very ill. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said police did not permit her to take her medicine with her when she was detained and said police refused her request for medical assistance <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said the protesters in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> carried banners calling for the release of Ms. <PERSON> Novotvorskaya </PERSON>, for freedom for all Soviets imprisoned for their views and for `` an end to repression.'' He said one man was detained for handing out leaflets that called for Ms. <PERSON> Novotvorskaya </PERSON>'s release and that the others were taken away by police because they had been carrying protest signs. `` They are now in one of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s militia stations,'' <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. `` Officials are not telling us where.'' Last Sunday, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> joined with groups of Armenians and Crimean Tatars on <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to call for the release of Soviet political prisoners. When the demonstrators marched down <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, they were given a police escort. Although they were not allowed to proceed to Red Square, their chosen destination, police made no move to stop them when they gathered across from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s city hall and chanted slogans. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was organized last month by a group of Soviets who want to challenge the political monopoly of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Among other goals, they are seeking a multi-party parliamentary system along Western lines and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and territory incorporated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> during World War II. Group members say that if Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, is genuine, they will be allowed to campaign for office However, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said the fact that <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents, and not police officers, broke up Saturday's demonstration was significant and potentially worrisome. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Russian-language initials as the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, is attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the equivalent of the country's Cabinet. `` Authorities here have decided to permit a small possibility of democratization, but now they're starting to make differentiations,'' <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said. `` I think the powers that be want to make a selection and arrest members of groups that are hostile to them.'' He said other unofficial groups were allowed to gather on <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> at 4 p.m., less than one hour after the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s protest was broken up, and that no official move was made to disperse them.

 The industrial giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, which forced thousands of people into work programs to fuel the Nazi war effort, will pay nearly $ 12 million to the laborers and their families, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, chairman of the West German Jewish Council, on Saturday welcomed news of the payment but said the company should have made reparations years ago. `` To wait this long is a horrible betrayal of all those who suffered,'' <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON> said. `` It comes too late for the thousands who have died in the meantime.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, in a telex statement Friday to the news media, said a total of 20 million marks, or $ 11.7 million, would be distributed to forced labor victims from the company. The agency said the money would go to former forced laborers and to the families of people who died while in forced labor with <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the largest industrial conglomerate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, joins other major German companies that have paid such reparations. It manufactures buses and automobiles, including the <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, and its wide-ranging subsidiaries include a major aerospace manufacturer. The announcement of <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>'s payments followed a lengthy study the company commissioned to determine the extent to which forced laborers were used in its plants during World War II. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the payment but scheduled a press conference Monday at its headquarters in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> and said details of the company study would be released then. Company officials said the conference would focus on the `` dark chapter of forced labor during the Nazi regime'' at <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. Like other German companies during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich, <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> used forced laborers to help the Nazi effort. Thousands of forced workers died from ill-treatment or were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. According to a study released in 1987 by an independent historical research group, more than 46,000 forced laborers were being used in <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> factories in 1944. The study, compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for 20th Century Social History, concluded that by the end of the war, half the company workers were forced laborers. They included people deported from occupied territories, prisoners of war and concentration camp inmates, the study said. The study detailed brutal work conditions and executions of workers accused of sabotage. It also concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> management conspired with Nazi leaders in the early 1930s to make the company the country's chief producer of engines and vehicles for the military. Many of the laborers were from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a 1986 study by the <ORGANIZATION> Cologne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> indicates. In 1986, the giant Flick conglomerate paid $ 2.9 million to slave labor victims. Other West German firms, such as the giant <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> concern, a major weapons producer during World War II, have also paid reparations. In addition to the company payments, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid billions of dollars in reparations to victims of the Nazi regime. In 1952, the <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> Agreement was signed between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Under terms of the agreement, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has paid $ 48 billion to Holocaust survivors.

 A half dozen geese flew into the engine of a Europe-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet Saturday, forcing the pilot to shut it down and return to Kennedy International Airport on the three remaining engines, authorities said.

<HEAD>Mecham Criminal Case Goes To Jury This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> long has acknowledged he did n't itemize a $ 350,000 campaign loan on his financial statements, but it will be up to a jury to decide this week if that failure was a criminal act. Closing arguments are scheduled Tuesday after seven days of testimony in the trial of the impeached <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, on charges of concealing the loan. The prosecution's case is based on `` smoke and mirrors,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> told reporters after the defense rested its case Friday without testimony from either defendant. `` I'm confident that the state has not proven its case,'' the former governor said, although he stopped short of predicting he will be acquitted. `` We are confident that the jury will return a just verdict,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, was removed from office April 4 by impeachment conviction on two unrelated charges. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to consider a charge on the loan for fear of prejudicing the criminal trial. He also was the subject of a recall movement, but an election was canceled after his impeachment conviction. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, first received national attention in January 1987 for his decision to cancel a Martin Luther King holiday for state executive branch workers on grounds it was illegally created by his predecessor, Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, without legislative authorization. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also drew criticism for defending an author's use of the word `` pickaninny'' in a book in reference to black children, and he made a variety of statements that offended women, Jews, homosexuals and Japanese-Americans. In the criminal case, he faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted on all six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was treasurer for his younger brother's 1986 campaign, faces up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted of three similar counts. The prosecution contended that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s campaign badly needed the $ 350,000 loan from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, but that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> wanted to conceal its source because it would contradict his campaign theme of being `` beholden to no one.'' None of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s personal or campaign financial reports lists a $ 350,000 loan from <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>. Instead, one campaign report includes a $ 465,000 lump sum identified as a contribution from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> himself. The $ 450,000 also included a $ 100,000 loan to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from a financial institution and a $ 15,000 contribution by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. The Mechams put up two defenses: that the loan was properly listed as part of the $ 465,000 lump sum, and that the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent mistake by <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. Also, former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> testified for the defense that the loan was `` common knowledge'' among <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s inner circle. The prosecution said it was immaterial whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s closest aides knew about the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan. `` This is the document where the public gets its information, is n't that true?'' prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> asked one witness, referring to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s contribution and expenditure report. `` I'm not talking about insiders in the campaign, finance chairmen, close confidantes of <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> long has acknowledged that the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan appeared nowhere on his financial statements outside of the $ 465,000 lump sum, until he filed an amended form in November 1987. He also insisted last fall that the loan was made to the campaign, not to him personally. But <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> testified that he considered the loan a personal one, not to the campaign. A former <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> campaign finance committee member, <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasser </PERSON>, testified that he could n't recall the meaning of notes he took during a committee meeting in fall 1986. The notes said `` show <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> borrowed money'' and `` do n't show borrowed money.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> refused to say Friday why he did not testify. His attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said he wanted to avoid having his client `` brutalized'' on cross-examination.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s response to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address Saturday, given by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>: Since 1981, we've seen our trade deficit skyrocket more than four times over We've seen millions of manufacturing jobs lost and thousands of farmers thrown off their land. During these years, the president has stood idly by, failing to develop a trade policy to enhance American competitiveness. He even called our trade deficit a sign of strength. Three years ago, the Democrats took the bull by the horns and crafted a trade policy that would enhance our competitiveness. We fought for fundamental change in our trade policy and were able to forge a consensus, at least among Democrats, about what we must do to do compete, strengthen education, improve productivity, and invest in plan and equipment and people. The human factor would be the most decisive factor of production. In a historic effort, Democrats working with Republicans were able to craft a bill. It took three years and countless discussions to write. It was designed to put the tools in the hands of our workers and businesses, to improve our competitiveness and pry open markets. Despite the strong support for the bill, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the measure. In doing so, he deprived us of the trade policy we so desperately need. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> based his veto on his objection to the plant closing provision in the bill _ a provision which he claims will hurt business and had nothing to do with trade. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs the plant closing law. If we're going to prepare for the future rather than protect against it, we must give our workers the time needed to adjust and find new employment. It's a simple provision. It requires management to give workers a 60-day notice of impending plant closure _ nothing more, nothing less. During my travels across the country, I met countless workers who had suffered from the lack of a plant-closing provision. There is simply no justification for a worker showing up at the plant gate for work to find it chained shut. Many businesses have joined with the president in fighting the provision. At the same time they have fought for their own golden parachute and 60-day notification for themselves in hostile takeover situations. They refuse to grant workers the same consideration.. I refuse to accept the president's notion that people can be treated just like any other asset, to be discarded when no longer needed. Our workers are the best in the world. They've proven their ability to adapt to change. In many cases, labor and management working together have been able to find solutions to the company's problems The plant closing provision is an investment in our people. It's unfortunate that the president chose to scuttle the trade bill because of his opposition to this provision We desperately need a trade bill. Trade is not an academic issue; it is a human issue. We cant continue to follow the course set by this administration. We've seen our position as the world's largest creditor nation erode to that of the largest debtor. We continue to run historic trade deficits. Behind these numbers are real people _ business people and workers who've seen their companies go under because of unfair foreign competition, farmers who have lost their farms because they ca n't sell their products overseas. It's time for a change in our trade policy to put our economic ship of state back on course. The plain and painful fact is that without any incentive for reciprocity many of our trading partners are using our outdated assumptions to take advantage of us. We've got to realize that the world has changed and we must change with it Mr. President, the trade deficit is not a sign of strength; it's a sign of a failed policy We must now work together to change that policy and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong again.

Although no figure was given, the assets involved were believed to be a small part of the $ 1 billion that <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> officials suspect <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> put into Swiss bank accounts during his 20-year rule. The ruling covered assets in banks in the western state of <LOCATION> Fribourg </LOCATION>. Swiss media said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has $ 50 million in <LOCATION> Fribourg </LOCATION> banks, but <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> refused comment on the reports. The judge also gave authorities in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> access to relevant bank records in <LOCATION> Fribourg </LOCATION>, one of 26 cantons, or states, in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The ruling seems certain to be challenged by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> arrives on an official visit on Wednesday and is expected to discuss her government's efforts to recoup <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> assets in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The assets have been frozen by the government since March 1986. In an unpublished decision Tuesday, Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Pierre-Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Esseiva </PERSON> freed the <LOCATION> Fribourg </LOCATION> assets for delivery to a <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> criminal court, which will decide if they were illegally acquired, <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> said. Bank documents will be given to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> general prosecutor, he said. A ruling by <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s highest court in July 1987 lifted bank secrecy for an investigation of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' assets by Swiss authorities, but <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> was not given access to the results of that probe. Most of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> assets are believed to be in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, where appeals by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lawyers and <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> bank have delayed investigators. By contrast, authorities in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> are expected to rule soon on a repatriation of any assets they have found. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was deposed in February 1986 and now lives in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, has denied having money in Swiss banks.

<HEAD>California Aqueduct Still Shut Down By Quake-Caused Power Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crews worked around the clock Saturday to repair earthquake damage at a pumping plant that shut down the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Aqueduct and its supply of water to the southern half of the state, officials said. The damage to circuit breakers at the <ORGANIZATION> A.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edmonston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pumping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, which pumps water over the <LOCATION> Tehachapi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was the most significant damage from Friday's quake. There was no water shortage because of sufficient supplies in storage lakes, according to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. `` The aqueduct itself ... is intact with no damage,'' he said, and the plant was expected to begin pumping again on a limited basis on Sunday. The only injuries blamed on the quake, felt in central and southern areas of the state, were in <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where a tree fell about the time of the temblor. A woman and two men were treated for injuries, said Fire Capt. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullbright </PERSON>. The quake also tumbled rocks onto Interstate 5 close to the quake's center, but traffic was not blocked. The quake was also strong enough to knock goods off shelves at a <LOCATION> Wheeler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> truck stop. The temblor at 4:06 p.m. Friday measured 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. It was centered on the <LOCATION> Garlock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>, 11 miles north-northeast of <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Tehachapis </ORGANIZATION> northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, according to seismologists at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest measuring 4.0. The 200 mile-long <PERSON> Garlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Fault </PERSON> is the second-largest fault in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The largest is the 600 mile-long <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Aqueduct runs 440 miles from <LOCATION> Tracy </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> delta, taking water that has flowed to the delta from rivers in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, south to <LOCATION> Perris </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It provides half of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>'s water.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> flew Saturday among Democratic platform writers over whether to raise taxes on wealthy Americans, the issue creating the largest gulf between the camps of cinch presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and runner-up <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The plaform drafters put off until Sunday discussion of defense and foreign policy issues, while their staffs worked behind the scenes to draft planks on drugs, civil rights, the economy and other domestic issues. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, lawyer and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, urged the platform committee to lend <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` a hand'' by giving him a credible platform, including a pledge to raise taxes on those earning $ 100,000-plus a year. `` I am not trying to hamstring our party's nominee. ... We need to give him an answer that is believable when he is accused of being a tax-and-spend Democrat,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> told her 15 colleagues on the drafting panel. `` It would be irresponsible of us not to give him an answer that he can look any Republican straight in the eye and say, ` I am not a tax-and-spend Democrat; I am a raise-revenue-and-invest-in-America Democrat,' and be proud of that,'' said <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, whose father was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s football coach in high school. But <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state representative and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, said the talk of raising taxes troubled her. `` I think what we have to do is re-order our priorities,'' she said. `` Surely there is a better solution than ` Give me more.''' Other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates said the party should look first to crack down on tax evaders, as the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has promised. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> said, `` I find no need to even raise it in the platform because that would give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the opportunity to say, ` Oh, look! They're interested in at least some kind of new taxes.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s top emissary to the platform committee, made a conciliatory statement, saying, `` If it were required to have revenue increases down the road, clearly Democrats are going to see that as a last resort.'' Any new revenues would be `` based upon policies that recognize who has the ability to pay,'' he added. But <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> told reporters afterwards, `` The Democratic platform in 1988 is not going to call for a tax increase.'' `` There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> is a great guy, but he did n't win the nomination.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, promised to raise taxes. The drafting committee will hold its third and final day of meetings Sunday at this resort's Grand Hotel. The full 186-member platform committee meets in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> June 25-26. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, who chairs the drafting panel, said, `` If we can reach a strong consensus and agreement in the drafting committee, then I think the chances of a large number of significant amendments in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that potentiallay could be divisive and ripping of the fabric of our party will be lessened. The same thing will be true in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a Baptist minister, left at mid-day to officiate at the wedding of a friend's daughter in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but planned to return afterwards. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief emissary, said the tax dispute was `` perhaps the most difficult issue and perhaps the greatest difference between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns. I can not say for sure whether we will be able to work out compromise language.'' `` This is a driving force in the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. Otherwise we think the Democrats risk being ridiculed for wanting to change priorities but having no vision of how you get the money to do it,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' comments on revenues just restated what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said all along. `` One wonders if we are n't already at the last resort. We've got a deficit that keeps growing. When do you get to the resort that is the last one? We think you've got to face this issue now,'' she said.

<HEAD>Deputy Suspended Because Her Fingernails Are Too Long</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sheriff's deputy whose fingernails are a quarter-inch over regulation was suspended for four days after she refused to trim them, saying she's had them long all her 10 years on the job and they do n't interfere with her work. <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who works at the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> juvenile center, has nails that are three-eighths inch past her fingertips. A grooming policy adopted by the sheriff's department May 16 says nails may not be longer than an eighth of an inch. The policy covers a range of subjects, including the length and style of hair, personal hygiene and wearing jewelry. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> filed a grievance over the policy, claiming it is an issue that should have been decided in collective bargaining between department officials and the deputies' union. She was suspended Wednesday for a day for violating the rule, and again on Thursday, this time for three days, for not trimming her nails. On Friday, the union filed suit against <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Omodt </PERSON>, claiming that the failure to negotiate the policy was an unfair labor practice and that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was disciplined for exercising her right to file a grievance. <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> denied a temporary restraining order Friday and scheduled a hearing for Monday on whether a preliminary injunction should be issued. <PERSON> Omodt </PERSON> did not return a telephone call to the department Saturday. His home telephone is unlisted. In an affidavit filed with the court, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said she has had her nails the same length for the 10 years she has worked as a deputy and they do not affect her work. The objection is not over the grooming policy, said her attorney, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanick </PERSON>, but over the failure of the county to bargain with the union. He also said there is a right to privacy in personal appearance as long as it is not detrimental to the job. Another problem with the policy, <PERSON> Tanick </PERSON> said, is that it does not spell out what the consequences are for violating it. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has been threatened with disciplinary action up to dismissal, according to court documents. <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney, said Friday there was no need to bargain about the policy because it falls under management's rights, rather than being a term and condition of employment that must be negotiated. Said <PERSON> Tanick </PERSON>: `` We believe there are serious law enforcement issues in the county that merit attention. Too much time and energy has been devoted to this petty issue. `` As long as the deputy is competent, the length of her nails should not matter.''

<HEAD>Rapidly Changing China Leaves Maoist Ideology Behind</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a nation that takes its political slogans seriously, a large billboard in a provincial capital, reading `` Efficiency Is Life _ Time Is Money,'' is a dramatic sign of the times. It is an indication of how <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideologists, the shapers of public opinion, have been backed into a corner by the rapid acceptance of private ownership, shareholding and free markets _ all capitalistic challenges to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. `` Capitalism has absorbed things from socialism _ now we should absorb some good things from capitalism,'' said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a training ground for ideologists. Capitalism was once dismissed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as an evil opposed to socialism. `` But we now believe that was wrong,'' added <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. The official doctrines that have often forced the Chinese to worry about whether they are being good communists have been in a state of flux since <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the pragmatist famed for saying, `` It does n't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice,'' came to power 10 years ago. Declaring that `` poverty is not socialism,'' he dismantled <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s communes, restored the profit motive and unleashed free-market forces into a rigid system of central planning. Today, the concern of most Chinese is how to get better wages and cope with rising prices. `` As long as the economy is prosperous and living standards are raised, our purpose is fulfilled,'' said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Yining </PERSON>, a prominent economist. This month, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will publish its last issue of the journal `` Red Flag,'' whose heavy prose has for 30 years set the tone for party ideology. In its place, the party will inaugurate a publication called `` Seeking Truth,'' which is expected to concentrate on economic reforms and political democratization. Party leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, a major supporter of economic reforms, announced at a party conference last fall that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be in what he called the `` primary stage'' of socialism through the middle of the next century. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told economic planners they would be allowed to adapt capitalist practices as long as these advanced the national goal of economic development. Party propagandists hailed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s laissez-faire approach to socialism, which played down the need for ideology to back up policy The Guangming Daily, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading intellectual newspaper, said in a recent commentary that great changes have taken place in the past decade. `` However, we can not deny that in many places dogmatism, like a specter, still binds the people's thinking and hampers the development of socialist modernization,'' it said, adding that even these days, almost every new economic or political reform must still overcome suspicions of being too `` capitalistic.'' By adopting unorthodox approaches to Marxism and capitalism, the new theorists are trying to legitimize reforms that have brought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> television commercials promoting consumption, free markets taking away business from state stores, and millionaires with servants. Many of the new theorists say the ideology of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, who lived in the 19th century, can not explain the modern relationship between socialism and capitalism. They say <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s insistence on class struggle over economic development was a disaster for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Leading social scientist <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Honglin </PERSON> recently wrote that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ once <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s model as an economic system _ has failed to match the productive energy of capitalist countries. `` Socialism is not a cake that can be ordered, and there is no fixed pattern for socialism,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> wrote. `` To promote reforms we must make breakthroughs in theory,'' said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yao </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Shareholding, private ownership of property and even the democratic process are other Western practices that can be of use to Chinese socialism, the party school theorists said. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 18 million private entrepreneurs have become `` an important auxiliary part'' of the economy. But the party theorists insist that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remain a socialist country whose vital task is to define socialism to meet the country's changing needs. Reflecting this task, the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> has said it will this year start a new research project _ the study of a modified form of socialism. The head of the research team will be one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most progressive political thinkers, <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, who a year ago was fired from his position as head of the academy's <ORGANIZATION> Marxism-Leninism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for being too liberal.

 Investigators tried Saturday to piece together what happened to a free-lance gemologist between her disappearance in February while carrying more than $ 500,000 in diamonds and her death less than a month ago. An autopsy on <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>, 33, whose naked body was found Thursday floating in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, showed that she died within the last month of a beating to the head. She was last seen at her <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building the day she was supposed to return six diamonds worth between $ 500,000 and $ 600,000 to their owner after a proposed sale fell through. Two brothers who allegedly arranged a meeting between a potential buyer and Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> are in federal custody on charges they pawned one of the missing diamonds in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. They are not suspected in the murder because they have been in custody since April, and Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> was then alive according to the autopsy. Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON>'s body was covered by plastic bags and was bound in the fetal position by a Venetian blind cord around the neck, wrists and ankles, police said. An autopsy Friday found she died from multiple blunt force injuries to the scalp and face that caused skull fractures, brain contusions and brain hemorrhaging, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. She was identified through dental records and an appendectomy scar, Ms. <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> said. `` According to the doctor who did the case, she was n't in the water for very long,'' Ms. <PERSON> Borakove </PERSON> said. `` She was not dead for a very long period of time from the time they found her yesterday. It certainly is not months. Whether it's weeks or days, I can not pin it down.'' Ms. <PERSON> Mangiameli </PERSON> had worked for 10 years in advertising and two years ago went into the gem business. She recently graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Gemological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Vanquished Republican presidential candidates said Saturday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represents `` safe change'' and transition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era, but warned <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> activists it would be fatal to take his election for granted. `` It is not for the vice president to win this election by himself,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told a `` Unity'88'' conference. `` The task is too large, the stakes are too high and the opposition too bitter.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was joined by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in seeking to rally party officials and activists from 16 states while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> enjoyed a one-day campaign respite in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said he would not worry if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to trail Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the polls because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` operates better in the underdog position.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also said he believes that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a wellspring of support in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the Sun Belt states and much of the west, and that this translates to a core support base constituting 210 of the 270 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes needed to win. `` He's constantly underestimated,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told the party activists. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the possible disaffection of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from the Democratic cause, if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is given short-shrift treatment in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` offers a great opportunity'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to improve his standing among minority voters. He also said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reap much of the support from Democrats and independents who backed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying these voters `` will come back in droves'' when the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views become better known. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in public opinion polls, sometimes by 15 or more percentage points. But <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comeback from his loss to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in the leadoff <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and said, `` Now, he operates better in the underdog position He enjoys it more. I do n't care if we're behind. We may be behind all along.'' The former candidates coupled appeals for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> support with stinging denunciations of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic nominee. `` Somebody ought to let Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> know that there is no owner's manual for the White House,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who during the campaign had accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of being a do-nothing stand-in for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at ceremonial events. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, speaking to a luncheon audience, urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep working to broaden the base of the party. He also said the Republicans should not concede the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Please do n't write off the Northeast. Please do n't think we can win by knitting together some kind of electoral base from the <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, and forget the Northeast. ... Do n't write off anybody,'' he said. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` represents safe change'' for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would bring about `` radical and dangerous change.'' `` I think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1988 does not want extremism of the left or righp,'' zaig said. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is the voice for `` discredited and disconsolate liberals,'' and told his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> audience the party must work to bring back disaffected conservatives in its own ranks. `` We know that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era, is nearly over,'' he said. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said some conservatives who supported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cause have become disenchanted, and he said the party must be vigilant about voters who thirst for change after seven and a half years. `` Many are beginning to nit-pick at the fringes,'' displaying worry about such problems as drugs and declining educational performance, he said. Speculation about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s likely choice as a vice presidential running mate hovered over this meeting, popping up in lounge and coffee-shop talk at the Hyatt Regency hotel here. During a workshop speech, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> joked about suggestions that `` we're all here because we all want to be on the ticket.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander and onetime White House chief of staff for President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said `` I'm content'' with having made a try for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he will not seriously consider whom to select until <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made his choice known. Party Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> activists to work hard for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the grass-roots level, saying that `` you do n't do from a podium, you do n't do it with slick television ads, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unless we do it _ work hard.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters should not be disheartened by the various polls showing the vice president trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying the governor had benefitted from eight weeks of primary victories after the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race had essentially ended. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> likes `` the calm and reassuring continuity <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represents,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Iranians Attack Two Ships In Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Iranian gunboats staged daylight attacks Saturday on a West German freighter and a British-owned supertanker 350 miles apart in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. One crewman died and two were wounded in the attacks. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the raids `` could easily be interpreted as a direct show of defiance'' by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of American military might in the gulf. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship was dispatched to aid the 258,979-ton British supertanker Esso Demetia off the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> coast after it sent out what a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman called a `` general appeal for assistance.'' The American spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship, which he declined to name, would provide `` humanitarian assistance.'' He said reports indicated that the Esso Demetia was on fire. Gulf-based shipping executives, who had reported the attack earlier, said the supertanker crew was battling serious fires on board. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said the Esso Demetia `` was attacked by two fast boats,'' had a fire in its tanks, and lost one lifeboat. It said no injuries were reported. Four hours earlier, a Filipino crew member was killed and two others were critically wounded when two gunboats fired on the 11,744-ton German frighter Dhaulagiri in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The ship was under charter to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, according to shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity. As with other recent Iranian forays against commercial shipping, the raids caught the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships patrolling the gulf out of position to intervene with force, had they been asked to do so. There are about 10 American warships patrolling the waters. Under expanded `` rules of engagement'' that went into effect on May 3, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders in the gulf are allowed to intervene when a non-U.S. flag ship in international waters asks for help. The six Iranian attacks since May 3 have been away from areas where they might encounter opposition from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships. The 11,744-ton <PERSON> Dhaulagiri </PERSON> was sailing northward into the strait when it was attacked Saturday morning. The attack on the Dhaulagiri was the first by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in two weeks. It followed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s attack Thursday that killed two crew members aboard a chartered tugboat. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed another air strike on Friday but it was not independently confirmed. The Dhaulagiri was manned by five Germans and 14 Filipinos, the shipping executives said, and all the casualties were Filipinos. The executives said a man speaking with a Filipino accent was heard on the radio calling frantically for assistance after the attack. `` He was begging, almost crying, for helicopter assistance to remove the wounded,'' one executive said. They said an <ORGANIZATION> Omani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol boat responded to the distress call and took the injured to a hospital. The Dhaulagiri was bound for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Dammam </LOCATION> when attacked, and it headed to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> for repairs Saturday, the sources said. Since violence from the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict spilled into the gulf in 1984, more than 500 merchant ships have been damaged or lost and more than 300 sailors killed.

 Mountain climbers will place a huge sheet over the Arc de Triomphe to hide restoration work on the capital's beloved monument. On Friday, 25 mountaineers will climb 165 feet to the top of the arch to hang a 2,400-square-yard, red-white-and-blue canvas sheet on one side of the monument. The first phase of work will take the entire day, organizers said, with the other faces of the monument to be covered with sheets in the following days. More than four tons of paint were used to cover the canvas in the red, white and blue colors of the French flag. About $ 6 million will be spent to repair water and pollution damage to the arch, which was constructed in 1806-1835 as a monument to <PERSON> Napolean </PERSON>'s armies.

 Four railroad tanker cars, including two containing flammable chemicals, overturned near downtown Saturday, forcing authorities to close one of the city's main thoroughfares. A railroad worker was taken to a hospital with minor injuries he received from inhaling vapor given off by anhydrous trimethylamine, a volatile chemical that leaked from one of the cars. Only a small amount of vapor was escaping, said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanf </PERSON>, and the other three cars were not leaking. One of the other cars contained butane and the other two were empty. The accident occurred shortly after noon near the intersection of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> 315, which links the city and its city's northern suburbs, and <LOCATION> Goodale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> just northeast of downtown. Police and fire officials closed two entrances to Highway 315. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, 41, the injured worker, was in fair condition at Doctor's <LOCATION> Hospital-North </LOCATION>, a nursing supervisor said. According to a hazardous materials handbook published by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, anhydrous trimethylamine gives off vapor that is irritating and harmful if inhaled and is extremely flammable. The fumes may be ignited by heat, sparks or flame, the handbook said. Butane, which is used as a fuel, is explosive and flammable.

 Soviet leaders came and went, but <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> stayed _ in prison. Then came <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and now <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>, a 60-year-old Russian Orthodox deacon who spent more than half his life behind bars, is a free man. But he is also a broken man, so out of touch with his country that he never heard of `` perestroika,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s system of reforms for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After 36 years in labor camps, prisons and psychiatric hospitals, <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> was suddenly released on May 31 from a Siberian mental hospital, flown to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, put in another psychiatric hospital and released Friday. Many such hospitals had become notorious for being used by the government to jail political prisoners. The diagnosis used to keep <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> locked up was that he was schizophrenic. <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>, hunched over and frail-looking, limped into a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment Saturday to face two dozen reporters and fellow Christians. An elderly woman broke down in tears at the sight of the brown-haired man with a drawn face and tired brown eyes. <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> crossed himself every time he rose to speak _ something he says he did even while locked up. He had difficulty answering reporters' questions, giving rambling and confused answers. Asked what he thinks of perestroika, <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> responded: `` I do n't know anything about it. I was in isolation.'' At one point, <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> said he was put in a straitjacket and beaten for refusing to mop floors on a religious holiday. `` He's only seen doctors. He's not used to our world,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> activist who has also been jailed. `` We hope he is the last of the Stalin-era prisoners, but we do n't know for sure,'' said <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, who introduced <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> to the reporters. There were other signs that the Orthodox deacon was out of touch with the times. <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> apparently had never seen a bottle of soft drink before _ he asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> put before him was wine. Soviet authorities gave him a passport, and he plans to leave June 17 for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, then settle in the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Seminary in <LOCATION> Jordanville </LOCATION>, N.Y. The release came during the celebration of the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, an event that has brought new focus on Soviet restrictions on religious freedom But <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> credits only one person for his release _ the Rev. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, an Anglican minister from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, who has waged a 10-year campaign for the Orthodox clergyman. To draw attention to <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>'s plight, the 41-year-old minister spent 46 days during Lent this year in a cage made of wood and chicken wire outside <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin-in-the-Fields </ORGANIZATION> church in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He told Saturday's news conference he had collected 36,000 signatures on a petition demanding <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> first met the man he helped to free at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Psychiatric Hospital No 7. on Thursday On Saturday, the minister smiled broadly and presented <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> with a British-made religious icon and a box of chocolates. <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> said he was born in the southern Siberian region of <LOCATION> Altai </LOCATION> and was first arrested in 1949 under the leader he calls `` the Communist bandit,'' Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. He had been studying at an underground Orthodox seminary in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. He then spent two years in a labor camp and was released before being arrested again in 1954 for alleged anti-Soviet behavior. He also spent time in four Soviet psychiatric hospitals. <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON> said he learned to interpret the Soviet government's claim that it provides free medical care `` Not free care, but free torment,'' he said. `` I am healthy,'' he added. <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>'s survival was `` a tribute to his faith in God.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, in addition to bringing changes in the economy, have also resulted in the release of more than 140 political and religious activists in the past few years. Soviet officials announced in January that a new law would make it illegal to commit a `` patently healthy'' person to a mental institution. The government has also said that some mental hospitals administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the police and prisons, were being transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

 Premiers <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> open talks under tight security Monday in an effort to cement a fragile reconciliation between the traditionally hostile <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s three-day visit to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> _ the first by a Turkish premier in 36 years _ is the latest move to improve relations after a Greek-Turkish summit at the Swiss ski resort of <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION> in January. `` We went to <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION> and agreed on a no-war course ... we have n't ensured peace, but we're striving for consolidation of peace in the region,'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> recently told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Fifteen months ago, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> nearly went to war over oil-drilling rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> in a flare-up that apparently persuaded <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> to change his hard-line policy toward <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. For years, the former American economics professor had rejected <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s offers of friendship, suggesting that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> had deep-laid plans to invade several Greek islands near <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s Aegean coast. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s anti-Turkish rhetoric struck a chord with Greeks who view <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> with suspicion tinged with fear _ a legacy of four centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and periodic eruptions of violence over the past 30 years. `` There were anti-Greek riots in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in the 1950s, trouble over <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in the'60s and the Turkish invasion of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1974. It's hard to believe the Turks really want to be friends,'' said businessman <PERSON> Ioakim </PERSON> <PERSON> Papazoglou </PERSON>, whose family used to live in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Although Greeks welcome the reduced tension, the speed and style of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s policy switch has produced criticism from both conservatives and leftists. `` Perhaps the suddenness of <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION> took people by surprise, but what's being done is a step-by-step process that will take a long time, perhaps a decade, to bear fruit,'' said a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. Conservatives claim <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has yielded ground to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> by focusing on minor issues and boosting trade rather than on the topics dividing the two countries. The crucial problems, they say, are the disputes over sharing mineral rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> continental shelf and the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to agree on an appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a ruling on the continental shelf problem. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> would prefer the dispute to be solved through direct talks. Following a public outcry over his failure to raise the issue at his first meeting with <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of 1,619 Greek Cypriots missing since the Turkish invasion, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> says he will certainly raise the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem this time. During <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s visit, Greek Cypriots living in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> intend to march to the Turkish Embassy and lay a wreath outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is disappointed that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has n't withdrawn some of the 30,000 Turkish troops occupying the northern third of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> as proof of its commitment to better relations. The island was divided into <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and Turkish Cypriot sectors by the Turkish invasion that followed a 1974 coup aimed at uniting <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> also has linked <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s application to join the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> with <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> would assist <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s membership bid in the 12-nation trade bloc if the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem was solved. The two premiers will meet in the seaside suburb of <LOCATION> Vouliagmeni </LOCATION> under tight security. The security was stepped up following anti-Turkish demonstrations and bomb attacks against Turkish diplomats' cars during visits in May by <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bedrettin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalan </PERSON> and Turkish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> on Saturday opened the cartel's 83rd meeting by urging members to set aside their differences and reach a production pact that would stabilize the floundering oil market. `` Only an accord based on consensus will achieve the required impact and send the right signals to the market,'' <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> told the 12 other oil ministers in his opening speech at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' regular mid-year meeting. The meeting began after 6 p.m. -LRB- 12 noon EDT -RRB-, more than three hours late, lasted two hours, and adjourned until 10 a.m. -LRB- 4 a.m. EDT -RRB- Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will try to decide whether to change an agreement among 12 of its 13 members to limit output to 15.06 million barrels a day. The agreement, which was extended in December and expires June 30, was designed to support oil prices at $ 18 a barrel. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not join in the pact, insisting on a quota equal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The two nations have been at war since September 1980. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, was elected <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president for another six months in a vote taken at the start of the first session. He assumed the post in June 1986 and has been re-elected at every meeting since then. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos-Alvite </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s oil minister, was re-elected vice president. Pessimism about the possibility of the cartel reaching agreement on a new accord has depressed the oil markets, pushing prices well below the target. The spot price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil, fell 52 cents to $ 15.85 a barrel on Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, dropped 42 cents to $ 16.865 on the spot market. A Venezuela-led group has wanted to cut production to push oil prices up while <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> leads other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members who want to raise output or at least hold it steady to maintain the cartel's market share Industry analysts believe <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is so deeply divided that it will extend its current agreement for three or six months. But late Saturday, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> appeared to have softened its position.

<HEAD>Envoy Says Anti-Nuclear Law Would Shut Down U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would close its military bases here and end its security relationship with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> if an anti-nuclear bill became law, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said Saturday. Charge d'Affaires <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> made the statement during a queston-and-answer session following a speaking engagement in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He was asked if <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> and Subic Naval Base would still be useful to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if such a law were passed. `` No,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> replied. `` It's the end of our security relationship. We will be less capable without <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Subic </PERSON>, but we'll get the job done.'' The 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday approved a bill banning nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed ships and planes from <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> territory. The bill is expected to run into resistance in the more-conservative, 200-member House of Representatives. It also would have to be approved by President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, who has veto power. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is not to confirm or deny the existence of nuclear weapons in specific places. In his talk, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said `` nuclear weapons, for all their destructive effects, have kept peace better than anything else in history.'' Noting that this country has battled a communist insurgency for 19 years now, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said Filipinos `` should not fear nuclear weapons, but the increasing prospect of communism.'' `` Filipinos have the right to be worried, but not of nuclear weapons but of the prospects of radical communism which has destroyed religion in several countries,'' the diplomat said.

 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders have promised to pay a monthly subsidy of $ 42 million to support the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> newspaper reported Saturday.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Saturday he will continue seeking delegates to boost his strength at the Democratic National Convention, where he wants a laundry list of issues included in the party's platform. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose 1988 presidential prospects evaporated when <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> clinched the Democratic nomination last Tuesday, announced his plan in an hour-long speech before about 1,200 singing, cheering, applauding supporters at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded. `` We're going to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with the ability to help shape the platform,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is working on solidifying the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> movement and unifying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he would announce specifics of his plans within the next week or so. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would spend a significant amount of time before the July convention pursing the support of `` super delegates,'' the 643 party leaders and politicians who received seats as delegates because of their posts. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has won support from just 54 super delegates, while 347 are backing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, according to The Associated Press delegate count. The rest are uncommitted. The issues, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants to become part of the party's platform, include achieving statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; getting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state; and establishing a program of national health care <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> again staked his claim to the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, which he says should be offered to him because of his second place finish in the race for the party's presidential nomination. On Saturday, he said his experience in foreign policy would strengthen a ticket with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he wants a vice president with foreign policy experience. Well ...,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, pausing to an ovation. With relations eased between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the most critical foreign policy issues and conflicts are in the developing world, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The selection of the vice president could be used to give someone with Third World experience and sensitivity a chance,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was not interested in a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post, saying `` an appointment position is also a disappointment position. A vice presidential position is a constitutional position from which you can not be fired because you're elected by the people.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, however, that if he were asked to be the vice presidential nominee, acceptance would not be automatic. `` It's a matter that my family must wrestle with, I must wrestle with personally. It's a decision I will make at the time.'' `` The fundamental question right now is our constituency has earned serious consideration'' for the vice presidential nomination, he said. `` Surely based upon the tone we've set, the votes we've delivered, the elections we've won, the general mandate we've gotten from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, has earned us serious consideration.''

<HEAD>Graham Preaches as Christian Celebration Continues in Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> brought his impassioned brand of preaching to a church packed with Russian Orthodox believers on Saturday, but the evangelist's fire-and-brimstone delivery failed to ignite his listeners. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s appearance was part of this communist country's celebration of the 1,000 th anniversary of the arrival of `` Some things change, some things never change,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told the crowd gathered in the 17th-century Church of <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kazan </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Kolomenskoye </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` God never changes. Human nature never changes.'' `` Your liturgy is based on the Bible. And the Bible says that the world will be shaken from time to time,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, clearly alluding to the social changes that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is attempting through his reforms. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a Southern Baptist evangelist, was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as part of the officially sanctioned celebration of the introduction of Christianity into <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> by Prince <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> in 988. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s English-language sermon was translated into Russian by the Rev. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON>, head of the Russian Orthodox seminary in the northern Russian city of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The Soviet congregation reacted coolly to <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s sermon, only waving their hands when he asked at one point if they were happy. A few clapped politely as he was driven away from the church in a government-owned black <LOCATION> Chaika </LOCATION>. `` It was strange,'' one woman told another as the worshipers filed from the church and mingled with those who had not been able to find room inside. Blue-shirted uniformed police officers were scattered at the edge of the grounds but made no move to interfere with the proceedings. Soviet authorities brutally repressed the church in the years after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, especially under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, jailing or killing many priests and nationalizing church property. Until recently, police surrounded churches on such religious holidays as Easter, allowing only the elderly to enter. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the state has returned to the church the Monastery of the Caves in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, agreed to build an old-age home for priests, and promised to liberalize a 1929 law which sanctioned suppression of the church. In another sign of relaxation, authorities on Friday released a Russian Orthodox deacon, <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipilov </PERSON>, who spent 36 of his 60 years in psychiatric prisons. Signals that authorities will moderate constraints on the church have aroused mixed reactions among visiting clergymen. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who said during a 1982 visit that he thought the church in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was free, this time said only that `` the people seem to be warmer. That makes me glad,'' according to his spokesman, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plowman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> did not speak with reporters at Saturday's service. Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Friday, `` I think anyone in his right mind prays that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is sincere and wants to bring about a new era.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, the highest-ranking American in the largest <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation ever to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, was scheduled to attend an evening religious vigil Saturday night. That service is in preparation for the celebration Sunday of one of the holiest dates on the Russian Orthodox calendar, known as `` Sunday of All the <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Who </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forth </ORGANIZATION> in the Land of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, whose prominence in the Soviet government dates to the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era, met Saturday at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> with foreign religious dignitaries who are in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the church millennium. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> assured his guests that authorities were working quickly to redraft the law on religion to guarantee greater tolerance of believers, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said.

<TEXT>
 About 5,000 Roman Catholics packed St. Vitus Cathedral on Saturday for the consecration of two assistant bishops, the first such appointments allowed by communist authorities since 1973. Catholics seized the opportunity to show their support for defiant Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and the Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. After the ceremony, hundreds of believers massed at the entrance to the archbishop's palace, shouting `` We want religious freedom!,'' `` Long live father cardinal!'' and `` Long live the pope!'' <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> has come under strong attack from state-run news media this year for supporting a petition for more religious freedom, which has been signed by an estimated 600,000 people. Saturday's ceremony was the first public consecration of assistant bishops in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 55 years and was marked by repeated calls for more bishops denied by the communist regime. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> officiated at what was a major church gathering to celebrate the formal appointment of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebeda </PERSON>, the 75-year-old vicar general of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and 64-year-old <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Liska </PERSON> as assistant bishops of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The state was represented by Minister of Education <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kymlicka </PERSON> and officials of the state church authority, but not by <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Janku </PERSON>, the head of the department. The first churchman to speak was parish priest <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Otcenasek </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Trmice </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, who was consecrated as bishop in 1951 at age 29 but was never permitted by the authorities to take up office. In his address, frequently interrupted by applause, <PERSON> Otcenasek </PERSON> assured the cardinal: `` You feel the difficulties and fears of us all. ... The church in our country speaks in a single voice and that comes out of your mouth.'' In April, the cardinal wrote to Premier <PERSON> Lubomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Strougal </PERSON> urging that the church and the authorities open a new dialogue. The offer was rejected amid indications the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is reinforcing its atheist drive. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> said in his short sermon, `` We expect this to be only the beginning of further consecrations of bishops. Nine dioceses have been waiting a long number of years for their diocesan bishops.''. Ten bishoprics in all have been reported to be vacant. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s mentioning nine apparently has to do with one bishopric being Greek Orthodox The event was attended by bishops from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. After the ceremony, papal emissary Archbishop <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> addressed the congregation in Czech, assuring the faithful of `` church solidarity.'' Later, the faithful lined up six deep along the short route to the archbishop's palace, cheering church dignitaries as they were driven by. They then gathered in front of the palace, shouting their support for the cardinal and for religious freedom and singing hymns. The crowd dispersed peacefully after about 45 minutes. Police looked on but did not interfere.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> on Saturday said that massive Western loans to the Soviet bloc could backfire without fundamental changes in the East's economic system <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said on the final day of the three-day <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conference that large increases in Western lending might boost living standards in the East `` at least for awhile. ... But such lending does not generate the means of future repayment. `` There are massive systematic failings that can only be solved by changing the system itself _ by a repudiation of rigid centrally-planned monopolies and a move toward meaningful prices, and decentralized enterprise,'' he said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, also told the conference on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> security that the two German nations `` bear a special responsibility'' for reuniting <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> urged the East to strive for currency convertibility by 1995 so the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies could do business in international markets using their own currencies. `` Currency convertibility is the necessary act for the Eastern economies to join the world economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. He also criticized the human rights situation in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, especially targeting the conference host country, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Traveling to <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, most of us drove through check-points in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and saw armed guards at the ready. Restrictions on freedom of movement and conscience are still daily facts of life,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s speech marked the first time a West German leader of <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s rank made an official address in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1952, made several references to World War II as well as to atrocities that occurred during <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rule of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It is obvious that we Germans bear a special responsibility for overcoming the division of our continent,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. `` The bitter experiences of this century prompt those nations to keep a watchful eye on us Germans.'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> spoke out strongly for a `` common European house.'' `` We Germans must render a major contribution to building confidence between East and West. We want to re-activate the once so varied and fruitful bonds between Germans and Russians. We want to develop and deepen them with the aim of overcoming the division in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also praised the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and rejected any suggestion that increased East-West cooperation could `` decouple the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> pronounced <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` dead duck'' in the presidential race, even as the vice president's campaign manager and former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals said Saturday they were n't alarmed by his weakness in the polls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he is not worried yet about Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' lead in the polls, saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` operates better in the underdog position. `` He enjoys it more,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` I do n't care if we're behind We may be behind all along.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, both of whom are assured of winning their parties' presidential nominations this summer, stayed close to home Saturday. The vice president took the day off in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, while the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for his home state's Democratic convention Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also kept to home turf Saturday with an hour-long speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to supporters at Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated his claim he should be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said he would continue gathering delegates to force the party to accept his issues as part of its platform. `` We're going to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with the ability to help shape the platform,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> is working on solidifying the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> movement and unifying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was attending a `` Unity'88'' conference in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where party leaders from Western states heard <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vanquished <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals urge them to help defeat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` It is not for the vice president to win this election by himself,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the conference. `` The task is too large, the stakes are too high and the opposition too bitter.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the winner of the Republican caucuses in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said he has been wary of polls since his own loss to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. When he looks at the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> poll numbers, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I think of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and I think of my pollster. God bless his soul.'' `` I remember coming into the hotel one day, whistling ` Hail to the chief,' but I was the only one there,''' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats were crowing about the political strength their home-state candidate was showing in the public opinion polls, some of which have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by as many as 15 percentage points. `` President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it has a nice ring, does n't it?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said in his speech to the state convention. `` Some people say do n't count your chickens before they're hatched,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said `` Well, I say the Republicans have already hatched their chicken in this campaign _ and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a dead duck.'' `` You have made me what I am, and I am eternally grateful,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his state convention. `` Nobody has been blessed more than I.'' But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who has been criticized for a lack of experience in foreign policy, was taking heat Saturday for his suggestion earlier in the week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should move its embassy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> declared its capital to be <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after seizing the eastern part of the city from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and most other nations continue to keep their embassies in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies should be placed `` where the host nation says its capital is.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was quickly criticized by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, and on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said if the governor was indicating the course of his foreign policy `` then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'s future role in assisting to bring about a just peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> will further erode and will be seriously jeopardized.'' And <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' statement as just election-year rhetoric. `` It happens every time,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said Saturday on Israeli radio. `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is a controversial issue, and therefore everybody will try to exploit this in order to attract votes.'' Meanwhile, Democrats drafting the party's platform clashed over whether to include a call for raising taxes on the rich. The proposed plank is backed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters and opposed by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces, who want to keep talk of raising taxes out of the party platform. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s top emissary to the platform committee, said `` The Democratic platform in 1988 is not going to call for a tax increase.'' `` There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> is a great guy, but he did n't win the nomination.'' <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> had said he would raise taxes. The drafting committee would hold its third and final day of meetings Sunday on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a posh resort nestled between <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s upper and lower peninsulas. Also on Saturday, former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the Democrats' 1984 presidential nominee, announced his endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, praising him as a `` brilliant, gifted public servant blessed with a sense of compassion.'' In a letter to the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democratic convention, <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is the person who can bring our party together and wage a strong campaign based on our shared Democratic values.''

<HEAD>Trooping the Color: Queen Honored On Official Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cavalrymen and foot soldiers in scarlet tunics and bearskin hats paraded in the center of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Saturday to honor Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> with the Trooping the Color on her `` official'' birthday. The queen, who is 62, celebrated her real birthday on April 21, but the official birthday ceremonies are held on the second Saturday of June when the weather normally is better. The sky was overcast and there was a damp chill in the air Saturday. This year, for the first time since 1973, the 1,588 men of all five regiments of the Brigade of Guards joined the parade because all are currently based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The guards _ Grenadier, Coldstream, <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION>, Irish and Welsh regiments _ are often scattered, seeing service in such places as <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Four generations of the royal family joined the ceremony this year, riding in coaches or on horseback to the Horse Guards Parade, an open square in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, where the queen inspected the Irish Guards while massed bands played. Each year one regiment performs the honors, marching in intricate patterns and carrying the `` color,'' or regimental standard. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, wearing a blue coat and wide-brimmed hat, arrived in a horse-drawn phaeton and took the salute standing on a dais. It was the second year she had used the carriage since retiring her horse, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION>, which she used to ride sidesaddle for the occasion, wearing a scarlet uniform. The queen's 5-year-old grandson, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON>, was with his mother, the Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, and his great-grandmother, Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, in her carriage. Riding horseback was the heir to the throne, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in his uniform as colonel of the Welsh Guards, along with the queen's husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, a colonel of the Grenadier Guards On her return to <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>, the queen appeared on a balcony to wave to her subjects and thousands of tourists. Saturday's pageantry was based on the ceremony used for guard mounting in the 18th century and was first performed on the sovereign's birthday for King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. But during the 18th and 19th centuries the trooping was seldom attended by the monarch. In 1895, the color was trooped in the quadrangle at <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> took the salute from a carriage. From that year on, a senior royal person has always been in attendance.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic-Farmer-Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement on the first ballot Saturday to challenge Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>. In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, 45, invoked the name and ideals of his father, the late vice president who 40 years earlier won the <ORGANIZATION> DFL </ORGANIZATION> nod and his first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election. `` As I stand here today, I'll say for the record that his vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is still alive, in you and in me _ the people of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> received 64.05 percent of the 1,323 votes cast, four percentage points more than required for endorsement. Peace activist <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 67, received 23.52 percent of the vote, 9.42 percent was for `` no endorsement,'' and 1.63 percent was for other candidates. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> declared the first-ballot endorsement a great victory, but others said he should have done better. `` No one ever says the DFL does things in lockstep,'' said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, a former state senator and attorney general since 1983. The leader of an anti-abortion caucus took credit for denying <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who received 808 votes, an additional 118 votes that were cast for no endorsement. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> said his caucus members refused to vote for <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> because he does not support a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion. Prior to the endorsement vote, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> asked for the delegates' support in a voice reminiscent of his late father `` I ask for your endorsement,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` I ask that you give us the time and the passion and the energy to make this the great country that it will be.'' In his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> sought to tie <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> to the policies of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` For the future of our country, we must unite to defeat the Reagan-Bush administration, and we must defeat their henchmen, like <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, `` is part of the problem down in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He talks about <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> values but he votes and acts a different way.'' <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> has voted against school lunch programs, student loans, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> and education funding, Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` I want to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future, invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s people again,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> is unopposed for the Independent-Republican endorsement, which is to be made at next weekend's IR state convention.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s half-brother, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, has operated <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> companies that have capitalized on programs to aid minority businesses, but has often hired white-owned firms to do the work, a newspaper reports. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, who faces criminal charges in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said Saturday that subcontracting is common in the construction industry and contends he did nothing wrong. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was arrested last weekend in his hometown of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, on charges that he hired someone to attack a murder witness last Dec. 4 in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. The witness, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, who survived five stab wounds, was to testify in connection with the 1986 murder of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> employee. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that in several instances a company owned by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was awarded contracts aimed at minority firms but then contracted the work to others. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, reached by telephone Saturday at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office of his <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We have not been found wanting by any agency in any investigation.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, free on bond, also said he had no reason to harm Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>. `` She looks at me as if I'm a fatherly figure,'' he said. `` I've known her and her mother all their lives. He maintained that authorities are after him partly to hurt <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s bid for president. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said he last saw <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> when he and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> got into a fight in December 1985, about a month before <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> was killed. `` He had enough enemies. Anybody could have killed him,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> also charged that authorities timed his arrest in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> `` to make me appear to be the Achilles' heel of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s campaign. He said he has not contacted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recently and has not played an active role in the campaign. `` My efforts have been strictly that of a well-wisher,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has declined comment on <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s arrest. Precision Contractors was formed in 1979 by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who is black, and <ORGANIZATION> Paschen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a white-owned firm. The newspaper said state records and interviews show nearly every aspect of the work on a granite ramp in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s State of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, awarded to Precision under a state program for minorities, was subcontracted to a white-owned firm, <ORGANIZATION> Wolverine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. In 1979, the Metropolitan Sanitary District found that the work on a $ 4.3 million minority contract obtained by <ORGANIZATION> Robinson-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a white-owned firm, <ORGANIZATION> Tunnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was done by <ORGANIZATION> Tunnel </ORGANIZATION> employees, the newspaper said. Two years later, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said, Precision got a $ 23 million sanitary district subcontract for work on Deep Tunnel, a giant pollution control project, but farmed virtually all of the work to other firms. `` All general managers and construction managers contract work out to specialty trades,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` We subcontract to other specialty contractors, whether they be white, or black or green or blue. `` If I'm a general contractor who just happens to be black, why ca n't I conduct myself like other general contractors who happen to be white?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said Precision did not get minority business contracts from the city of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because city officials concluded in 1980 that the white partners controlled the firm. But <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the city's conclusion was wrong and Precision successfully appealed. `` We are certified now,'' he said. The newspaper said that in March 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Paschen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> sold its 2,500 shares of Precision to the company for $ 3 million. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Paschen </PERSON>, who retained an interest in Precision, sued two years later, charging that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> had siphoned more than $ 1.6 million from the firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. The case was settled after <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Paschen </PERSON> $ 1 million, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the charges by <PERSON> Paschen </PERSON> were unsubstantiated and he used the opportunity to buy out <PERSON> Paschen </PERSON> and another former partner. `` It was like a divorce,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday said it would ensure the safety of foreigners here after warning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of a possible terrorist attack on Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` All foreigners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whether they are stationed here on a long-term basis or have come for a short stay, can conduct their activities here as usual and should not be worried,'' said the vice minister of public security, <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> <PERSON> Linfang </PERSON>, in a report carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Gu also was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> as saying that `` some persons recently attempted to harm Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' but the report gave no specifics. It quoted <PERSON> Gu </PERSON> as saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has already taken necessary measures in this regard, and the problem has been solved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> sent an `` urgent notice'' Thursday to Americans living in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> warning of a possible attack by terrorist from an unidentified third country. High-level Public Security officials informed the embassy of the threat and told it there was <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> involvement, but the Chinese gave no other details, embassy officials said. No known incidents have occurred of attacks in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> against Chinese or foreign residents, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has good relations with <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> nations which have been accused of fostering terrorist activities. The embassy in years past sent out similar warnings based on worldwide alerts against terrorists, but this was the first time the threat was directed specifically to Americans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, embassy officials said. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying, `` The Chinese government always attaches importance to the security of foreigners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the security of foreigners in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is ensured.'' The advisory sent by the embassy warned Americans to avoid restaurants, markets, nightclubs and other public places known to be hangouts for Americans and other foreigners. An estimated 1,500 American businessmen, diplomats, students and teachers and their families live in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, tourist hotels and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses all stepped up security measures Friday in response to the warning.

<HEAD>Youth Movement Leads To Resignations In Soviet Academy Of Sciences</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sixteen members of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> have resigned simultaneously as authorities press a campaign to bring new blood into the prestigious institution, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. The official Soviet news agency said it was the largest mass resignation in the history of the 900-member, Moscow-based academy, which traces its roots to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> the Great's creation of a Russian Academy of Sciences in 1724. The academicians' terms normally would not have expired until 1990. Their departure appeared clearly linked to a drive led by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to enlist Soviet scientific apparatus in his drive for scientific and technological progress. That step is seen as crucial if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for `` perestroika,'' or economic and social restructuring, is to succeed. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, head of the academy's personnel department, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> the scientists' mass resignation `` was prompted by a desire to draw young and talented organizers of science into the reorganization process more actively.'' Among those who resigned was <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON>, who was academy president until he was replaced in October 1986 by <PERSON> Guri </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alexandrov </PERSON> was named a counselor of the academy's presidium, or government body, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Six other men who had served as secretaries of various branches in the academy also asked to be relieved of their duties and made counselors `` for reasons of age,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Elections to fill the vacancies will be held before June 20, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. A rujuvenation process in the academy began in December, when 255 new academicians and lesser-ranking corresponding members were elected at a two-day meeting of the academy's membership. Many newcomers were from 40 to 45 years old. New rules were put into effect last year requiring academicians to retire at age 75. <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON> said `` the renewal of personnel in the academy would go on,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. He said 20 directors, three deputy directors and 160 heads of subdivisions still hold their positions despite their `` advanced age.'' The academy in the past has jealously guarded its integrity even at the risk of incurring political displeasure. It insists on holding its elections by secret ballot, when other Soviet organizations vote by a public show of hands. Physicist and human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, an academy member, was stripped of state honors and privileges after becoming active in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s. But academy members refused to oust him, and he kept his title of academician even after being exiled to Gorky in 1980. In December 1986, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, was allowed to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to resume his research work in physics.

 Risen Star romped to a 14 -RCB- - length victory in the Belmont Stakes Saturday in a runaway reminiscent of his father, Secretariat, who became a Triple Crown champion at <ORGANIZATION> Belmont </ORGANIZATION> 15 years ago with a 31-length victory Risen Star, who also won the Preakness, missed matching Secretariat's Triple Crown by finishing third in the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION>, the first of the three classic races. The winning margin was the fourth-largest in the 120 years of the Belmont. Secretariat set the record in 1973, <ORGANIZATION> Count </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> won by 25 in 1943 and Man O' War won by 20 in 1920. Ridden by <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Delahoussaye </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Risen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> completed the 1 -LCB- miles in 2:26 2-5. It was the second-fastest Belmont ever, topped only by the American-record 2:24 raced by Secretariat.

Risen Star paid $ 6.20, $ 4.80 and $ 2.80. <PERSON> Kingpost </PERSON> returned $ 11 and $ 3.80 while <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s Time was $ 2.60 to show. The victory was worth a winner's share of $ 303,720 to <ORGANIZATION> Risen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, who also picked a $ 1 million bonus for having earned the most points in the three <ORGANIZATION> Triple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> races _ 11 for his third in the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Derby </ORGANIZATION> and two firsts. Winning Colors also had six points going into the race.

<BYLINE>Ghost Of Daniel Lurks In 5th District Race
^By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time in 20 years, there's a tight race in the 5th Congressional District _ to fill the seat of the late Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, a Democrat who voted often with conservative Republicans. Both Republican <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> L.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> have tried to portray themselves as the right kind of conservative for the district described by officials of both parties as one of the country's most old-fashioned. The contest has featured broadcast and campaign-trail mudslinging, a novelty for the district and one neither side predicted will work when voters go to the polls in Tuesday's special election Often, the disputes have centered on what <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, who died last January, would have thought of the race. The Arey campaign proudly pointed to an interview late last year in which <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> referred to her as his `` ideological soul mate.'' The <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> camp has accused Ms. <PERSON> Arey </PERSON> of trying to put words in a dead man's mouth by parlaying that comment into an apparent endorsement. <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>'s campaign denies the charge. `` I'm sure if they had the same quote they would use it,'' <PERSON> Arey </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Butzke </PERSON> said. About a week before the election, Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON>, the 8th District Republican, went so far as to say he was `` absolutely conviced that if <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> were alive today he would be here supporting <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>.'' That did not sit well with 5th District Democrats, who said neither Ms. <PERSON> Arey </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> will ever match <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s superb political ability to please people from each party. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> was a lifelong Democrat who worked his way up from the textile mills yet voted often with conservative Republicans. As the campaign wound down, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON>, had harsh words about the use of his father's name. `` I continue to hear and read from various sources what my father, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, would be doing if he were alive today,'' <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Much of what is being said and written is completely contrary to his view as I knew it. I think it is unjust and insensitive for a candidate or campaign to speak as if <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> had or would have endorsed them. `` The fact is, he had not endorsed any candidate for his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat. It was his way to seek office on his own merit, and I am sure that he would prefer that his successor be elected on theirs.'' Ms. <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>'s latest television ads said it was time for voters to continue the 5th District's conservative `` legacy'' of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> has said that as a successful developer, he is better qualified to handle the district. Each side has lined up strong partisan support. Ms. <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>, who formerly worked in several posts with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has the president speaking for her on radio spots. She also lined up late-campaign appearances by former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will be the Republican presidential nominee, as well as several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressmen. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> has gotten the nod from the commonwealth's Democratic establishment. Stumping for <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> have been Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker A.L. <PERSON> Philpott </PERSON>. Both sides have predicted a close race and observers have said there will perhaps be a rematch in November's general election.

 <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s first socialist president and an easygoing man who occasionally put poetry ahead of politics, died Saturday from a heart ailment. He was 89. A founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a staunch anti-communist, the former president died at his home in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. At his side were his son, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Ernestina </PERSON> <PERSON> Santacatterina </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> had been treated for a cardiovascular problem for years. `` The Republic loses in <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> a central figure in the fight against fascism and Stalinism,'' said Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1922 and became a member of the directorate along with <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nenni </PERSON>. He went into exile in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> when dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> rose to power in 1926. Years later, in 1947, he broke with the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because he feared its leader, <LOCATION> Nenni </LOCATION>, was shifting too far to the left. He then formed the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and as secretary built it into a pro-Western and anti-communist force. `` In the name of liberty, he was a proclaimed enemy and always fought against all forms of dictatorship and totalitarianism,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, a former premier. During his seven years as the fifth president of the Republic, beginning in 1964, <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> worked for reforms in housing, medical care, education and taxation. He also presided over a period of economic prosperity. When he left office in 1971, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> again was beset by economic problems and political uncertainty. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> was a scholar fond of Roman philosophers and relaxed about politics. He once told a political leader who had waited to see him: `` I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long, but I was engaged in a talk with -LRB- Italian poet <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> -RRB- Quasimodo. Poetry should come before politics sometimes, do n't you think?'' His political life was not always tranquil. When he returned to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from exile in 1943 he was arrested because of his anti-fascism and imprisoned by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. He escaped, was recaptured, and escaped a second time together with <PERSON> Sandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pertini </PERSON>, who also later became president. After the war, <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> was ambassador to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and then president of the provisional assembly in 1946 that framed the new constitution. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> was born Sept. 19, 1898, in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> and obtained a university degree in economics and commerce. He worked as a bank clerk and for a newspaper and wrote political books under the pen name `` Togaraso.'' He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> four times and served three times as deputy premier. Saragat supported the Socialist-Christian Democrat alliance that governed <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during six of his seven years as president. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> engineered the merging of his party with the bigger <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, but when the unified party took a beating in the 1968 elections the two again separated. The Social Democrats are partners with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists, Republicans and Liberals in the governing coalition. <PERSON> Saragat </PERSON> is survived by his son and daughter. The funeral is scheduled for Monday.

<HEAD>Tests Show Waste Dumped Near Nigerian Port Is Toxic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Preliminary tests show that waste secretly dumped in eastern Nigerian by an Italian company is toxic, the military government announced Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that the dump site, near the port of <LOCATION> Koko </LOCATION>, had become somewhat of a tourist attraction, with Nigerians flocking to the area to see the waste. Earlier it was reported that security agents had sealed off the area, 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>. Scientists urged that anyone who visited the site seek medical tests. The dumping episode, the latest in a series of alleged efforts by European and American companies to dump hazardous waste in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has strained relations between <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. On Friday, the government seized the Italian ship Piave in <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> harbor and said it would be required to remove poisonous waste dumped in eastern <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. Earlier, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> recalled its ambassador from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Nigerian government spokesman <PERSON> Yusufu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamman </PERSON> said Nigerians and Italians were arrested in the case. He did not identify them. On Saturday, the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>, reporting from <LOCATION> Trieste </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, quoted an official of the LLoyd Triestino shipping company, <PERSON> Ennio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasta </PERSON>, as saying the <PERSON> Piave </PERSON> did not carry toxic wastes. <PERSON> Vasta </PERSON> was quoted as saying the Piave carried food products, home appliances, machinery and shoes and `` has nothing to do, in absolutely no manner, with toxic wastes.'' He was quoted as saying the Nigerians are pretending the Piave came loaded with wastes that actually were unloaded by two smaller ships flying flags of convenience. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> promised on Friday to cooperate with <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> in determining responsiblity for the dumping. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nwachukwu </PERSON>, the external affairs minister, on Friday asked <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s visiting foreign minister, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, to help African nations keep developed nations from turning <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> into a dumping ground. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, whose honorary consul general in <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> was arrested for complicity in the dumping of waste there, said the waste would be returned to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestesulen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Norwegian shipping company <ORGANIZATION> Klaveness </ORGANIZATION>, denied that the waste, described as slag ash from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, was toxic. He said, `` The content of toxics are well below approved <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. levels.'' Guinean authorities said the substance was killing trees on an island off <LOCATION> Conakry </LOCATION>, the Guinean capital. Guinean government employees were arrested in the dumping incident. On May 31, five Congolese, including three senior government officials, were charged with plotting to secretly import toxic waste for dumping there.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> wanted to use Anglican church envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> to lure <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to his <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> compound to increase chances <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> would be killed in the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack, according to book excerpts published in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report. The plan was considered and rejected, and <PERSON> North </PERSON> had to be content with drafting a White House statement to be released in the event <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was killed, which would call his death `` fortuitous,'' according to the account. The book, `` Best Laid Plans, The Inside Story of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s War Against Terrorism,'' was written by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, national security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. It looks at the events surrounding the April 15, 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said were conducted in response to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s role in the bombing of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> disco frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen. According to the book, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, then a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, planned to ask <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> on April 14 to meet with <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the hostage negotiator from the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, would ask <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s help in freeing the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> would then depart, leaving <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to spend the night at his compound, the book said. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, himself now believed a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, would not be told that he was being used to set <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> up for a killing, the book said. Such an assassination plot would have violated American law. Previous published reports have said that North and others on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> plotted the bombing <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a way of assassinating <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the bombing was not an assassination plot, although they have conceded that officials `` would n't have been upset'' if <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> had been killed. The book, excerpted in the magazine's June 20 issue, also reports that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was so eager to `` get <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'' that he doctored the intelligence section of an `` action memo'' prepared for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. North wanted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to think that a second Libyan raid would be more successful than the intelligence community or the Pentagon believed, according to the excerpts, which did not provide further elaboration. The bombing mission, known by the code name `` Operation <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>,'' had among its targets a frogman school, a <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> airfield and the compound that contained <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s military-staff headquarters and family home. Some bombs fell on civilian areas, and one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-111 bomber never returned, its two-man crew later declared killed in action. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was apparently unharmed, although there were rumors that the attack had left him confused and disoriented. Libyan officials reported that his 15-month old adopted daughter was killed and two young sons were wounded. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that after <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> survived the first attack, `` North immediately came up with another plan to kill him.'' Under that plan, <PERSON> North </PERSON> wanted to have an unidentified friendly foreign leader telephone <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> so that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials could monitor the conversation and pinpoint his location, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. That plan, too, was rejected by administration officials, the report said. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, has since retired from the military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from the diversion of profits to the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> rebels from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He was fired from his <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> job in November 1986, when the diversion became public.

<HEAD>Runoff Vote For A New National Assembly Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French voters on Sunday choose a new National Assembly that either will give President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> a Socialist majority or force him to continue `` cohabitation'' with the right. Five weeks after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won re-election with a solid 54 percent of the vote over conservative former Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the Socialist position appeared to be eroding and what once was seen as a leftist landslide in the Assembly voting has become a contest. The Socialists recently talked about giving away constituencies to centrists as part of their `` opening'' to non-Socialists, but they now are fighting for every seat and acknowledging the possiblity of defeat. Despite polling fewer popular votes nationwide than conservatives in the first round, the Socialists are given the edge to win a majority in the Assembly because of peculiarities in the spread of their support. Publication of polls is prohibited by law in the week before an election, but unpublished surveys indicate a Socialist advantage. In the first round of the legislative elections on June 5, the Socialists won 40 of the 577 seats in the Assembly and the Communists won one. On the right, the conservative Rally for the Republic and center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> won 77 seats and minor rightist parties four. Sunday's runoffs are being held in the 453 districts where no candidate won a majority in the first round. In addition, a first round is being held for two seats in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>. In districts where no candidate won a majority in the first round, all candidates with 12.5 percent or more were eligible for the runoff. As they have done in past years, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> agreed to support the leading leftist candidate. In districts where the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> candidate was ahead, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> candidate withdrew, and vice versa. The event of the week was the traditional right's similar deal with the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the party accused by nearly all political leaders of being racist and xenophobic. Though involving only a small number of seats, the left immediately seized on the issue and accused the Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy of signing a pact with the devil. For <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, it's the difference between being shut out of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> altogether and winning some seats. For the traditional right, it could be the difference between being in power or in the opposition. The Rally for the Republic and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> denied there was any `` deal'' with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. From 1981 to 1986, the Socialists had absolute power. In 1986, after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s five-year term expired, the right won a slim majority. But because <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had two years left on his seven-year term, the right and the left were forced into `` cohabitation,'' or power-sharing. The politicians hated cohabitation. But numerous polls indicated voters liked the balance of power between the right and the left. Analysts said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s score was due to his personal popularity and not necessarily an indication French voters want a return to leftist policies. On the other hand, his solid victory did create a certain momentum. The president said recently he thought it unhealthy for one party to have all the power in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, sensing his party was in trouble, he went on national television Thursday to ask voters to give him a clear majority with which to work in Parliament. As in the presidential campaign, not much attention has been paid to the issues. With all of the talk focusing on the `` opening'' and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, little concrete has been said about unemployment, social security or education. The French may be tired of voting. Turnout during last week's first round was 65.74 percent _ a postwar low

 Entertainers from the Bee Gees to <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> denounced South African apartheid Saturday and honored jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in the biggest charity rock concert since the 1985 `` Live Aid'' extravaganza. More than 70,000 fans jammed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> for the nearly 11-hour-long concert in honor of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday on July 18. They clapped, sang, danced and reveled in the sights and sounds of some of the world's top pop musicians playing together until nearly 10 p.m. -LRB- 5 p.m. EDT -RRB-. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, 29, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said he timed his British vacation for the concert. `` Just being here to me is important. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is an unjust situation all around. ... People just look at it and they turn away.'' For a finale, American opera singer <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> sang `` Amazing Grace'' a cappella and firecrackers shot into the sky in a circle around the stadium. The finale was a change from the expected `` <LOCATION> Nkosi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sikelele </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' -LRB- God Bless <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> -RRB-. The national anthem of several African states is also regarded as the anthem of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government There was no immediate explanation for the change. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, was sentenced in 1964, along with seven others, to life in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government. Modeled on Live Aid's `` global jukebox,'' which raised money for starving Africans, the anti-apartheid concert was beamed by radio and television to an estimated 750 million people in 60 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, organizers said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the concert for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, said half the expected $ 3.39 million in proceeds will go to anti-apartheid activities in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the rest will go to to seven children's charities in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Tickets cost $ 45. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it was covering the concert not as a political but as a musical event, but it broadcast opening comments that attacked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of apartheid, under which the nation's black majority has no voice in national affairs. Among the performers were <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION>, the Bee Gees, Wet Wet Wet, Dire Straits, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Masekela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeba </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salif </PERSON> <PERSON> Keita </PERSON> and Sting. Kicking off the show, singer-actor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` the leader of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oppressed black people'' and `` a symbol of the fight against the cruel and unjust system of apartheid.'' `` We salute you, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and we want to see you and your fellow political prisoners freed!'' <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> declared. The mostly youthful crowd cheered and sang `` Happy Birthday.'' Some waved placards. One showed a black hand clasped with a white hand. Another showed a broken chain around a black man's neck. Anti-apartheid banners festooned the stage, which was dominated by a huge portrait of Mandela behind bars. British idol Sting, the first performer, sang his hit `` Free, Free, Set Them Free,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s commentator, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Denselow </PERSON>, referred to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as `` a man politically imprisoned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, director of the anti-apartheid film `` Cry Freedom,'' called <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> `` a man of unshakeable principle and extraordinary courage.'' Fans danced on their seats, climbed onto the shoulders of others, and at times the entire throng swayed to the sounds from the stage. At one point, the crowd was asked to clasp hands in a Mandela tribute. They did so, creating a sea of upraised arms. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said no violent incidents were reported during the concert, but the police headquarters said equipment belonging to singer <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> was stolen. The theft delayed his appearance by three hours and reduced his performance from a scheduled 50 minutes to about 15. The concert launched five weeks of rallies and celebrations in honor of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>. South African Ambassador <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Killen </PERSON> complained the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s broadcast aids the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> regards as a terrorist organization The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said it paid no money for the broadcasting rights and was covering the concert only because it was an `` outstanding international musical event.'' But right-wing British politicians complained that the publicly funded <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> was violating its duty of impartiality. `` The whole thing is a gigantic con trick to make people believe the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is a respectable organization and not a bunch of gangsters,'' said Conservative lawmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> was billed by organizers as the concert's `` guest of honor.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Caborn </PERSON>, secretary the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, denied the charges of liberal bias leveled against the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>

 Dozens of forest fires broke out across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Saturday and police arrested at least four Arabs suspected of setting the blazes to protest <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Hundreds of stone-throwing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> students battled <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the most widespread protests since the army opened high schools last week in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> after they had been closed for four months. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 9-year-old Arab boy was hospitalized with a skull fracture suffered when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired rubber bullets in his direction from a distance of about six feet, said a doctor at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The doctor said the youngster was hit by rubber bullets in the head, chest and right shoulder and three of the boy's relatives were treated for minor rubber-bullet wounds. An Arab reporter said the boy was hit when soldiers opened fire to disperse a crowd trying to stop them from beating a 17-year-old Arab youth in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The army confirmed the boy was hit by rubber bullets and said the circumstances were under investigation. Firefighters have blamed Palestinian militants for setting more than half of about 400 fires that have ravaged at least 35,000 acres of forests and farms since early May. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> of the Jewish National Fund, which manages Israeli forests, said at least three of Saturday's major fires were caused by arson. He said a helicopter crew spotted two Arab teen-agers setting a blaze with torches and rags near the communal farm Maalei Hahamisha northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and police arrested one of the youths. Another Arab was arrested as a suspected arsonist in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported police arrested three residents of the Arab village of <PERSON> Jisr </PERSON> ez Zarqua in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on suspicion of arson. It was not immediately clear if the detainee <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> referred to was among the three. In a leaflet issued last week, underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising urged Arabs to `` destroy and burn all the enemy's agricultural and industrial resources.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, about 200 students shouting `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhbar </PERSON>!'' Arabic for God is great, piled stones and burning tires on main roads through much of the city, an Arab reporter said. The students threw stones and soldiers fired in the air to end the hour-long protest, said the reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no reports of injuries. Dozens of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> students also demonstrated in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, the reporter said. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed protests in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate and said he had no reports of student demonstrations elsewhere. The army closed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s nearly 1,200 schools in February, saying they had become centers of violence. The schools were gradually reopened in the past three weeks, and high school classes resumed Monday. At least 204 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed since Dec. 8, when the Arab uprising began in the territories that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. A military source said the army might reclose some schools where disturbances persisted but had no immediate plans to shut down the whole <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> school system. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said authorities detained a man seen setting a fire near the communal farm Maalei Hahamisha northwest of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> said police also arrested an Arab suspected of starting a forest fire in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Lower <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> region. Fires also were reported near coastal cities of <LOCATION> Ashkelon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the attorney for <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience, said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> vowed to physically resist efforts to deport him. Under a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> can be expelled at midnight, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials refused to say when he would be deported. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s Palestinian lawyer, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> for about 20 minutes on Saturday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> deported in May, saying he helped incite the Arab uprising. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, has said he supported civil disobedience against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but was opposed to violent forms of protest. The Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen during a 13-year stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1983 to found the Center for the Study of Non-Violence.

 Tipplers with a thirst for treasure got a chance Saturday to bid at an auction of bottles of scotch and champagne recovered from a <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> shipwreck 75 years ago. <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> bought her dad some Scotch whisky for a Father's Day present, three bottles that had been slowly vintaging in the cool waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> went down on Nov. 9, 1913. `` It tastes very good,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who paid $ 180 for the bottles of <ORGANIZATION> Whyte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mackay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scotch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whiskey </ORGANIZATION> and sampled some of the lake-bed booze at a pre-auction tasting session. `` It's a novelty, my father is a scotch drinker.'' So far, about 300 bottles of French champagne and Scotch whisky have been salvaged from the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, one of 19 ships that went down in the great November storm. Several thousand more bottles still rest under 80 feet of water roughly 3 -LCB- miles offshore from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanilac </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said commercial diver <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON>. Brusate accidentally discovered the wreck in July 1986 while searching for a tugboat that sank in the late 1960s. `` I was surprised to find the cases of liquor,'' said <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` Most freighters on the Great Lakes carried coal, iron ore and tons of wheat, but this was like a general store.'' The <PERSON> Regina </PERSON>, a 249-foot Canadian freighter, went down with all 27 crew members during one of the worst storms in Great Lakes history. `` You can buy scotch anywhere, but only here can you buy it from the lake bottom,'' said <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the ship's salvagers. `` It's a piece of our history, a collector's item.'' About 100 people attended Saturday's auction, run by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auctioneers, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Clicquot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, bid $ 85 for a bottle of 1906-1908 vintage <ORGANIZATION> Veuve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clicquot </ORGANIZATION> for the champagne company's museum in <LOCATION> Reims </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> The 60 bottles auctioned brought a total of $ 3,460, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, vice-president of <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s wine division. `` This was sort of a first for us, an experiment,'' he said. `` We are neither disappointed or ecstatic, because there's no real track record for this. We're glad the bottles found buyers.'' In December, the first auction of <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> artifacts in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> found bidders paying $ 15 - $ 35 for lumps of coal, matchsticks, and spoons, Ms. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said At a marine auction on Sunday in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the ship's compass, navigation lights and other nautical equipment were to be sold The proceeds will help finance further salvage operations which are scheduled to resume next month, <PERSON> Brusate </PERSON> said. He estimated that only about 10 percent of the ship's cargo has been recovered so far. The search will concentrate on finding the ship's safe, which reportedly contained $ 86,000 in gold coins, worth at least $ 2 million at current bullion prices, Ms. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. The gold was believed to have been the payroll for workers building the <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. Marie locks in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. When the salvaging work is completed, the wreck could yield a treasure worth about $ 5 million, she said.

<TEXT>
 Former White House spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said Saturday the media is doing a poor job of covering the presidential campaign, focusing more attention on theatrics than on issues. `` Voters want more meat and potatoes on the election, and the press is simply not giving that to them,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said. `` The press is giving all mood music and no lyrics. The coverage is very superficial.'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, said the media is dead wrong on presidential handicapping. `` Do n't ever go to the race track with a political reporter,'' he told the broadcasters. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman for six years. He recently lost his job at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of publicity generated by his admission in his book, `` Speaking Out,'' that he had concocted quotes he attributed to the president. <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said the weakness in television election coverage is its failure to tell voters the candidates' plans. `` Television news is giving a hybrid of charisma and fact,'' <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said, `` And that's not good enough. Too much is at stake.'' In its coverage of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said, the media has been `` lavishing its attention on his charisma, not his specific plans. There is a schizophrenia in television coverage between giving information or entertainment.''

 A committee of the 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- adopted a resolution Saturday calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its 20-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The resolution said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has ruled the occupied territories with a repressive policy. It also asks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end aid that subsidizes Israeli settlements in the occupied territory. Elsewhere at the assembly, Presbyterians began taking final action on less controversial issues facing the denomination while decisions were pending on major statements on nuclear war, health care and election of a top officer. While the general assembly began receiving committee reports, a four-member writing team met behind closed doors to draft a preliminary recommendation on `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age.'' The team is working from a paper, written last year after a five-year study, which has drawn widespread criticism within the 3 million-member denomination for its discussions of tax resistance and the immorality of nuclear war and nuclear deterrence. The writing group, which was joined by the two leaders of the originating task force, reworked the paper's lengthy policy statements and background to incorporate changes. The report will be presented to a subcommittee Sunday, with a report to the entire Peacemaking and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expected Monday. The entire assembly is expected to take up the report Tuesday. Also Saturday, a committee recommended that <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a lay leader from <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, be nominated for a four-year term as stated clerk, the officer responsible for operation of the assembly. The committee, which could have nominated two people, considered seven candidates including the current stated clerk, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, but declined to nominate him. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> was elected four years ago after serving 10 years as stated clerk of the Presbyterian Church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and one-year as co-stated clerk after the mainly southern PCUS rejoined with the northern church in 1983. Andrews and at least one other person have already said they will be nominated from the floor. The 630 commissioners, or delegates, are scheduled to vote Tuesday morning. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obedience </ORGANIZATION> paper has been revised to delete corporate church support of tax resistance and other actions of conscience against the government. However the subcommittee left in a recommendation for a voluntary Fund for Obedience to <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to offer assistance to resisters. On Friday, the 18-member subcommittee retained language in the paper that calls nuclear war immoral. But it changed a section labeling the theory of nuclear deterrence immoral to read `` nuclear deterrence as an end in itself'' is immoral. The Rev. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Come </PERSON>, a former seminary president who helped write the original report and sat in on the writing committee, said he expected some deleted portions would be restored before the report went to the assembly floor Tuesday. A committee also adopted a resolution to provide all delegates to the assembly with letters to sign and send to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urging him to work to release <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, one of the Americans held hostage, is a Presbyterian elder and president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> who has been held four years last week. The committee also voted to distribute yellow ribbons to the commissioners to help remember the hostages, who also include <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when he was taken hostage March 1985. Sunday's major event is a kickoff of the church's bicentennial year celebration with a hour-long television program being beamed by satellite around the country. The denomination was formed in 1983 from two Presbyterian groups that had split during the Civil War and is almost 14 times larger than the second-largest group, the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The assembly rejected a resolution Saturday asking that the organization begin reunion talks with the conservative, 200,000-member <ORGANIZATION> PCA </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In addition, a report was adopted critizing the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a 27,000-member denomination which the PCUSA accused of undermining some local congregations in efforts to get them to switch denominations. Commissioners approved the church's continued involvment in the Consolution on <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an effort by nine <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations to move toward agreements recognizing each other's sacraments by the mid-1990s

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Saturday blamed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for the breakdown of peace talks with U.S.-backed rebels but said his government was prepared to resume negotiations. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told a group of factory workers in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was seeking `` to make dust of the peace plan, to burn it, incinerate it.'' He claimed that rebel leaders met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, several days before last week's three days of negotiations to work out a strategy `` to kill the peace plan.'' But he said his Sandinista government is prepared `` to continue discussing outstanding points in the negotiating process'' with the rebels. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and rebels appear to be pegging their peace proposals on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s reaction after the collapse on Thursday of the latest round of talks. It is believed the Sandinistas hope to achieve a peace pact with the rebels, known as Contras, before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration leaves office next year. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a strong backer of the Contras and a peace agreement could dim if not eliminate prospects for renewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels. And the Contras say the possibility of a resumption of such aid puts pressure on the government to accept democratic reforms. The fourth round of talks failed last week to find an end to the war that has been waged for more than six years. Although the Contras said there would be no further meetings, it appeared that they left the door ajar. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, the head of the Contra delegation, said Thursday as the talks broke off, `` We have reiterated our deep conviction to looking to solutions to the conflict in our motherland in a civilized way.'' Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week and was quoted by the rebels<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` The armed road is the only option left for democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' A Contra plan submitted Thursday was described by the government as `` irrational.'' It called on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to disband the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, revise the public security law, rewrite the electoral laws and set up an assembly to rewrite the 1987 constitution. The White House put the blame for the breakdown of the talks on Sandinista `` intransigence.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was studying renewed military aid to the rebels. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had backed and trained the rebels covertly or with congressional approval since 1981. Military aid legally stopped Feb. 29, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted down <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for more war funding. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last approved Contra military aid in June 1986. The Soviet bloc and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> support the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. On the first of three days of talks last week, the Sandinista delegation claimed the rebels wanted the negotiations to fail to pave the way for new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> militlary aid. A cease-fire has been in effect since March 21, but both sides have accused the other of violations. The Sandinistas' 80,000-member armed forces have continued to receive Soviet military goods and it is believed the Contras, said to number between 6,000 and 10,000, have been stockpiling supplies and weapons during the fragile truce. The Sandinistas have been in power since July 1979 after defeating the forces of right-wing President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in a civil war.

 Rival Palestinian guerrilla factions battled with rockets and mortars Saturday for control of two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camps. Police said nine people were killed and 35 wounded in the fourth day of fighting. The battle in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> pitted <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas against the breakaway <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> faction of Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> Fatah is the main guerrilla faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Since fighting began Wednesday in the <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh and <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> camps, 19 people have died and 95 have been wounded. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire shook <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as guerrillas hammered each other's positions with mortars, recoilless cannons, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns, police said. They said <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s gunners, stationed in Syrian-controlled hills in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s central mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, pounded both camps with howitzers and mortars. About 50 Palestinian women who fled <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh demonstrated Saturday at west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION> refugee camp, which has stayed neutral in the clashes. `` What a shame. A Palestinian beats a Palestinian with fire!'' chanted the demonstrators as they reached the office of Fatah-Uprising. Col. <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, better known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>, broke away from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in a Syrian-inspired 1983 mutiny against <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s leadership and established his headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. The heavy clashes continued through the day, despite several cease-fire calls by a <ORGANIZATION> security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> made up of representatives of various Palestinian groups. The latest truce reached at noon eased the fighting, but tension was still high. Police said the big guns fell silent, but sporadic exchanges of gunfire were heard. Palestinian officials said 95 percent of <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Barajneh </PERSON>'s 29,000 residents have fled the camps to live with relatives or in makeshift homes in basements of unfinished buildings in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Others took refuge in shantytowns in south and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A statement signed, `` who is left from <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>'s residents,'' appealed to the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> to try to stop the bloodshed. `` We appeal to you in the names of <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION>'s patient and steadfast children, women and elderly to intervene and work seriously and quickly to stop this crazy shelling of our camp,'' the statement said. `` The shelling has taken the lives of women, elderly and children and caused grave damage to the camp. It has become almost impossible to walk through the camp because most of its alleyways are blocked with rubble,'' added the statement. <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> bore the brunt of fighting between <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militiamen in their three-year war for control of the Palestinian refugee camps. Almost every shack in <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> is roofless and has gaping holes or bullet scars from the war between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, which sought to prevent the Palestinian guerrillas from rebuilding the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> power base they lost after the 1982 Israeli invasion. The war ended in April 1987 after Syrian troops deployed around the shantytowns, ending a nearly five-month Amal seizure. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s loyalists had flushed out <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s guerrillas from both embattled shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting in the last two months, despite a reconciliation effort between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. But the dissidents regrouped on the fringes of the two camps, where Syrian troops are in control. On Saturday, a falling tree branch set off a landmine inside the old <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound on <LOCATION> Rue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemenceau </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, causing minor damage but no casualties, police said. The compound was abandoned after a 1985 spate of kidnappings of foreigners and is guarded by a few French marines and Lebanese police. They maintain mines in the embassy gardens to prevent trespassing.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Coca-Cola Being Investigated For Possible Bribery
In U.S.S.R</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury has subpoenaed from the <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> all documents related to its 1986 sales agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as part of an investigation into possible bribery, it was reported Saturday. The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, in their combined Saturday editions, quoted unidentified sources as saying the grand jury in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was trying to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bribed people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to get permission to sell <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> there. A federal prosecutor refused to confirm or deny the report and a spokesman for the Atlanta-based company branded any allegation of wrongoing by <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as `` ridiculous.'' The newspapers said sources would not say what precipitated the investigation, and characterized the inquiry as in its early stages. The 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits Americans from bribing foreign officials or political parties to get business in other countries. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> would not discuss the report with the newspapers. He did not return a telephone message from The Associated Press Saturday asking him for comment. `` Any allegation of wrongdoing related to our business with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is ridiculous. It does not even warrant a denial,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. He would not say whether <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> knew of any grand jury investigation, saying the two-sentence statement was the only comment the company would make. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 signed a six-year deal to sell <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> product, previously was sold in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but the 1986 agreement ended a long period of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s exclusive hold on the Soviet cola market. By the end of 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> had sold 10 million cases of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halle </PERSON>, senior executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, told securities analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last month.

<TEXT>
 The seven-party Afghan alliance, long beset by internal feuding between Moslem moderates and fundamentalists, promised Saturday to hold elections within four months on a future government for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The elections, to be held before Oct. 15, will be held among guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. They will choose a council that will vote on setting up an interim Moslem government to challenge the Soviet-backed Marxist administration in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. The election decision should bury a leading cause of dissension within the fractious Moslem umbrella organization. Alliance spokesman <PERSON> Gulbadin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the decision was unanimous. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, head of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the man who will replace <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> as of Wednesday, said the alliance has been divided over the makeup of the interim government. `` We believe it should be referred to the people. ... Some of our friends ... -LRB- in the alliance believe -RRB- everything should come from the top,'' <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> said. The alliance is often divided into two camps _ moderates and fundamentalists. But on this issue, moderate <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, who is considered an extreme fundamentalist, stood together in demanding elections. An election commission set up months ago by the alliance will decide the details of holding an election in the midst of a war that goes on unabated despite the start of a Soviet troop withdrawal. The commission has a July 1 deadline for its report. `` Eighty percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is free. I do n't see the problem of an election,'' said <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>. Aside from polling Islamic guerrillas and Afghans living inside the war-torn country, an estimated 5 million refugees living in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be asked to vote. `` One third of our people,'' are refugees, said <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>. He cautioned against anticipating elections `` according to Western ways. It's not possible.'' <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> envisions elections that combine the Western one-man, one-vote concept with traditional Afghan jirgas, or councils. <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> insisted that regardless of the methods employed or the composition of this government, it is only transitional until <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> falls and a nationwide election can be held. Critics demanding elections argued against seven men making decisions and claiming to represent the majority of Afghans. The alliance is often split, 4-3, with fundamentalists in the majority. One of the latest alliance decisions taken over objections from the moderate camp called for a boycott of attempts by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> to help form a broad-based, representative Afghan government. <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> said mujahedeen leaders should at least talk to <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, who mediated at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks resulting in the Soviet commitment to withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. A boycott, argued <PERSON> Galiani </PERSON>, only leaves the alliance in the dark and dependent on second-and third-hand reports. <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON> foresaw few difficulties in coordinating elections among commanders inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He denied charges that mujahedeen have begun fighting among themselves for captured weapons and ammunition.

 Police raids in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state left four people dead, including at least two suspected Sikh terrorists. Gunmen killed a Sikh political adviser, news reports said Saturday. Police also seized heroin valued at $ 5.25 million, found a large cache of weapons and arrested 13 suspected Sikh extremists in raids over a 24-hour period ending Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. In another report, the agency said <PERSON> Charan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dass </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghai </PERSON>, a lawyer and adviser to the Sikhs' Akali Dal party, was called from his home in <LOCATION> Moga </LOCATION> town by two men who shot him to death. UNI and government-run television reported the seizure of the heroin and listed the value, but gave no further details. Various news reports gave these accounts of the four deaths during the police raids: Security forces killed two suspected Sikh terrorists early Saturday in a gunfight in <LOCATION> Shankar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jalandhar </LOCATION> district. A third suspect escaped. On Friday night, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> killed <PERSON> Swaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> in a shooting near the Bab Pir border outpost in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district when he tried to cross into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and ignored orders to halt.

A security unit fired on a group of seven people trying to enter <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> near the Mangli border post, also in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district, killing one. The six others fled and the patrol found a large cache of arms and ammunition. Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population of 800 million but are in a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Militant Sikhs have been fighting for a separate homeland in the state since 1982, targeting for attack security personnel, Hindus and moderate Sikhs. In another development, hundreds of residents of the northern city of <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> protesting government plans to raise electricity rates battled police Saturday with rocks and crude bombs.

 The police officer whose fatal shooting of a Hispanic man triggered violent protests earlier this week will be sued for allegedly beating another Hispanic man in a separate incident last month, an attorney said Saturday. The streets of this town remained calm for the second straight night Saturday, but several residents said rioting could break out again if the officer is not indicted after an investigation of the shooting. Rock-throwing rioters broke windows and looted and toppled a car Wednesday and Thursday nights to protest the shooting of two Hispanic men by Sgt. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> shot and killed <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coria </PERSON> and critically wounded <PERSON> Coria </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Matteo </PERSON>, outside a bar early Monday. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> has said he fired in self-defense after <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Coria </PERSON> approached him holding a bottle. The officer has been suspended with pay pending the outcome of the investigation. <PERSON> Matteo </PERSON> <PERSON> Coria </PERSON> remained in critical condition in <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, a nursing supervisor who declined to be identified said Saturday. Lawsuits expected to be filed in federal and state courts next week will charge that <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and other officers used excessive force and violated the civil rights of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> during a drug bust May 19, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and several other officers beat <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, who required hospitalization for a cracked skull and possible brain damage, <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON> said. Police allege <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was hospitalized for swallowing a quantity of cocaine, the lawyer said. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> was admitted May 28 to the county jail and held in lieu of $ 15,000 bail on charges of drug possession, resisting arrest and aggravated assault, said Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodziewicz </PERSON> of the county sheriff's department. <PERSON> Dudas </PERSON> said other defendants in the lawsuits would be the city of <ORGANIZATION> Perth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amboy </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the police department; <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which trains the officers; and Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Otlowksi </PERSON>, who is the police director. <PERSON> Otlowski </PERSON> said he knew about the <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> case but declined comment. He again praised <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, calling him a `` man on a crusade'' who had probably the highest number of arrests on the narcotics squad. <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> said he had no knowledge of the <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> incident. Police Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> did not return calls to his home Saturday. <PERSON> Rockoff </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> community leaders Friday and agreed to investigate the shooting of the <PERSON> Coria </PERSON> brothers and present the case to a grand jury to halt the street violence. Residents said Saturday that the 109-member police force was tainted by a few bad officers and many singled out <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who they said frequently harassed Hispanics. If there is no indictment, `` a real riot could break out,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 29. `` We do n't want that to happen. We want a good community.'' `` He thought he was ` super cop,''' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, 37. `` He was an accident waiting to happen.'' `` The problem is with him, not the police department,'' said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, 28. `` He thinks he's something like Dirty Harry.'' City and county officials also agreed Friday to form a commission to investigate bias in the city and to establish a community council to hear grievances against police.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> thanked cheering home-state supporters Saturday for their support and received a glowing tribute from Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was a `` dead duck'' in his race for the presidency. `` You have made me what I am, and I am eternally grateful,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told delegates to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democratic Convention. `` Nobody has been blessed more than I.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose official job at the convention was to introduce <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to accept the party's endorsement in his re-election bid, opened his remarks by thanking the delegates and state officials `` for making it possible for me and for us to do what we have done the past 15 months.'' `` This commonwealth of ours and its people have set an example that I'm proud of and you're proud of and that I hope will set an example for the nation beginning in January of 1989,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` We have not only built an economic future for our people that we can be proud of, but we have done it with sensitivity and compassion. And that in the last analysis is the measure of us, and of our state and of our nation.'' For a day, the often-contentious <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrats engaged in a love-fest, paying tribute to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who is seeking his fifth full term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and whose endorsement was the only major official convention business. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who noted that he was first elected to the state Legislature the same year <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> began his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career _ 1962 _ called the senator `` our leader for many, many years'' and praised <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for his positions on issues ranging from civil rights to national health insurance. He then thanked <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for bringing `` his special gifts to people'' on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' behalf during the presidential campaign. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who failed in a 1980 bid to wrest the Democratic presidential nomination away from President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, announced in 1986 that he would not seek the presidency in 1988, clearing the way for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' entry into the race. `` President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it has a nice ring, does n't it?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said at the opening of a speech filled with praise of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and criticisms of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president and certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. `` Some people say do n't count your chickens before they're hatched,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said `` Well, I say the Republicans have already hatched their chicken in this campaign _ and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a dead duck.'' `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the man who did it for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the man who can do it for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` No one will campaign longer or harder for him than <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' The convention was held at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION>. The last major political event there was a rally hosted by then-Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the eve of his election to the presidency in 1960 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in an unusually festive mood later Saturday as he addressed the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at a banquet. He told the gathering that before coming to the dinner he `` went over to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who went to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, has tried to characterize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as elitist because of his <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> ties.

 A fire caused by faulty electrical wiring Saturday destroyed most shops and offices in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> capital's main commercial center. Several firemen fighting the blaze at <LOCATION> Naca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> mall fainted after inhaling the dense smoke, but police reported no other injuries. Most of the mall's more than 50 business offices, shops and boutiques were destroyed by the fire, causing several million dollars in damage, said owners and managers. Officials said the blaze broke out early in the morning when an auxiliary power generator in the <LOCATION> Naco </LOCATION> residential district was turned on, following a power failure in the area. The fire began in the middle of the mall, which only has three entrances leading to large walkways surrounded by shops. Firemen were unable to reach the center of the mall before noon because of the dense smoke. Firemen also had difficulty controlling the blaze due to a lack of water and equipment such as oxygen masks and protective clothing.

 More than 150 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested on disorderly conduct charges Saturday for blocking the entrance to a women's health center, police said.

But <PERSON> Juli </PERSON> <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, the Manhattan-based group that staged the demonstration, complained that police kept the demonstrators from leaving to keep them from resuming their protest. `` We believe they are being held in preventive detention in violation of the Constitution,'' <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said. It was unclear whether the medical office opened Saturday. In the morning a woman who answered the phone there hung up on a reporter without answering any questions. In the afternoon, an answering service took calls. `` This is a rescue,'' <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said. `` We wanted to stop the abortions that were to occur today and to offer alternative solutions to abortion, including counseling and information on medical care.'' Speaking from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> said police arrested the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, pastor of the Neighborhood Church in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herliahy </PERSON>, an anti-abortion activist, and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, an auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. During the first week in May, Operation Rescue staged anti-abortion rallies where more than 1,600 people were arrested.

<TEXT>
 A newspaper and its reporters were singled out for blame Saturday at a rally for supporters of a black teen-ager who claims she was abducted and raped by white men, and reporters responded by walking out. The rally organizers then banned The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and several other news organizations from a Sunday morning church service to be attended by the teen. The incident began during a tirade by lawyer <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> about a Newsday story earlier this year that said the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> was a federal informant who wore hidden microphones to meetings with civil rights leaders and organized crime figures. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> have made a racial issue of the case of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, who claims she was abducted and sexually assaulted by six white men over a four-day period last November. After initially cooperating with authorities, she and her family have refused to participate further, charging a cover-up. <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the mother of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, was sentenced to 30 days in jail Monday for failing to appear before a grand jury looking into the case. The lawyers and <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> say Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> took `` sanctuary'' at <ORGANIZATION> Bethany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the predominantly black <LOCATION> Bedford-Stuyvesant </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where about 200 people attended the rally. Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was present but did not speak. At one point, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> shouted, `` Tell them, -LRB- Gov. -RRB- <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, how you tried to set <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> up for physical assassination.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> then asked all Newsday employees to stand, and two black reporters did. Security guards, reading from a list of reporters in attendance, told the other <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> employees to stand. All except <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairley </PERSON>, 21, stood. One of the guards put his hand on Ms. <PERSON> Fairley </PERSON> and asked her to stand, but she resisted. `` I'm standing up. She does n't have to,'' reporter <PERSON> Clem </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> told the guards. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Fairley </PERSON> are black. About 18 reporters from other news organizations stood in unison. When a guard said, `` Security wants Newsday reporters to leave,'' their colleagues walked out, too, in a show of support. `` I left out of solidarity for reporters, black and white, who have been covering this story honestly, aggressively and faithfully for more than six months,'' said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reporter who is black. The Rev. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Denson </PERSON>, one of the rally organizers, later said the guard had been misunderstood and that no one had been asked to leave. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottman </PERSON>, a Newsday reporter, said he had been asked to leave. Afterward, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Poughkeepsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, met with <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The advisers said that because of the walkout, which <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> termed `` unprofessional,'' several news organizations would be banned from a Sunday morning church service. They were The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Poughkeepsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and Newsday. Hours after the rally, a representative of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> to say that <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would attend the service and asked that the service be listed on the daily schedule of events provided by the news services. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, a spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who was appointed by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> as special prosecutor in the case, said city police were not arresting Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> because `` we have no intention of swooping in to participate in the media circus that the Rev. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and attorneys <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> are intending to orchestrate.''

 The homes of 25 workers who may have been exposed to radioactivity during an accident at a steel plant have been checked and found free of contamination, officials said Saturday. Twelve workers were decontaminated Friday after molten steel spilled from a large ladle at the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant and damaged two gauges containing radioactive cesium-137, officials said. Plant personnel identified 28 employees, including the 12, who could have been exposed to the material, said <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Teams from disaster services, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, have checked 25 individuals and their homes and found no contamination, Ms. <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> said. Three workers had not yet been contacted Saturday, Ms. <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> said. The building in which the accident occurred has been closed while a consulting company cleans up the site under the supervision of <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff members, she said. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said the workers were trying to cut away molten steel after it had cooled when they came in contact with the cesium-137. The contamination was limited to the heavy clothing the workers were wearing except for one worker who received minor skin contamination. `` Apparently it -LRB- the contamination -RRB- got through or around the -LRB- heavy, insulated -RRB- glove he was wearing. He took a shower and that took care of that,'' <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. `` We would characterize this as a relatively minor contamination. None of the people involved are in any danger from it,'' he said. Cesium-137 is a radioactive, granular or powdered substance that could be harmful as a result of prolonged exposure, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. The radioactive material was contained in a capsule about an inch long in four gauges positioned atop a casting mold, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. The gauges regulated the amount of molten steel poured into the mold from the automated ladle. The contamination took place, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said, as workers tried to clean up the spilled steel. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of investigating radioactive spills, has not begun an investigation into the circumstances of the accident, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> will hire a consultant to assist in cleaning up the radioactive material, which will be taken to a nuclear waste disposal site in either <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a black businessman and former Democrat, won the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination Saturday to run for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat against former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, 67, is the first black to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since Reconstruction. He won a first ballot nomination over two rivals after promising to `` put an end to the era of <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>'' in a fiery address at the state GOP convention. `` They said it could n't be done, but we did it,'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> said after his nomination. `` They say <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> ca n't be beaten, but we're going to beat him.'' <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> will square off for the seat currently held by Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is not seeking re-election. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, a lobbyist and retired minister who lives in the northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, defeated <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahlquist </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide, and <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulk </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> attorney, for the nomination. His speech combined a thundering attack on <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> with frequent references to God, faith and family. He ended by leading the delegates in singing `` God <LOCATION> Bless </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' brining the crowd to its feet and swinging many uncommitted delegates into his camp. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> switched to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. He unsuccessfully sought the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination for lieutenant governor in 1985. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> is considered a huge favorite to win the seat. He won the governorship by a fairly narrow margin in 1981 but left office highly popular four years later. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> does not allow governors to serve consecutive terms. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, a lawyer and former Marine who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, is married to <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, daughter of former President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baines </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. A number of Republican leaders said privately that nominating a black candidate could cost the party some traditional support among conservative white voters. Political analysts said <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>' nomination was a calculated gamble to take away traditional Democratic support from minority voters. `` They're stealing thunder from 1989,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> political science professor. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is widely expected to nominate current Lt. Gov. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> to run for governor next year. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is the highest elected black official of any state. Although <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> is considered the underdog, he entered the nomination contest late and has not been cast against <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> in any polls. Also Saturday, convention delegates rejected a bid by a supporter of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> for a seat on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Incumbent <PERSON> Flo </PERSON> <PERSON> Traywick </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON>, who coordinated <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential nomination campaign in the state. Asked whether her defeat represented a rejection of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s followers by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars, Ms. <PERSON> Kincaid </PERSON> said, `` You're not going to hear that from me. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozell </PERSON>, a political analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said the vote showed `` that the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> people do n't have as much influence here as many people said they would.''

 About 60,000 people participated Saturday in a march for nuclear disarmament and rally in Central Park that brought together 200 peace, labor, religious and human rights organizations. The event was the city's largest political demonstration since 1982, police said. The activities capped a week of activities in support of the <ORGANIZATION> Third </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Special Session on Disarmament. The coalition organizing the event is seeking to increase interest in abolishing nuclear weapons by the year 2000. `` This is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> event to say, ` We still believe,' `` said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarrow </PERSON> of the folk singing group <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Along the roads winding through Central Park were booths set up by organizations that distributed literature, sold buttons, T-shirts and records. The day's events began with a torch lighting ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The torch came from the Eternal Flame at the <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> Memorial in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Those who arrived early then marched to Central Park for the international program of cultural presentations and speeches, which featured among others Coretta <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, folks singers <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yarrow </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Midnight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian rock group. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagan </PERSON>, national coordinator for the sponsoring coalition, said the demonstrations can have a `` momentous effect on the national political agenda.'' The coalition is calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons, self-determination for all nations, an end to military intervention and a shift from military buildups to global economic development. Police officials said the crowd was the largest at a demonstration in the city since 250,000 people attended the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' Second Special Session on Disarmament in 1982.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is evaluating the case against a group of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees who took 86 rare misprinted stamps from their office and sold them for thousands of dollars, a department spokesman said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the agency's public integrity section had received the case and that `` they deal in bringing criminal charges, if necessary. `` I would not want you to think that something is imminent,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was considering bringing criminal charges against the nine <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees, who discovered the rare stamps in the agency's supplies and sold them. The Post quoted unidentified intelligence and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> completed an internal review of what stamp collectors call the discovery of `` the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> invert'' and turned the case over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for possible prosecution. The public integrity section is debating whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 $ 1 stamps bearing an upside-down candlestick with a sheet of stamps that did not have the rare error, the newspaper said. Each member of the group kept one of the stamps and they sold the 86 remaining stamps in 1986 to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> dealer for thousands of dollars. Their identities were never made public. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call Saturday about the case.

<HEAD>LAPD Wins Trial Use of Hollow-Point Bullets; Critics Vow Court

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police here have won permission to use hollow-point bullets on a trial basis, outraging critics who say the bullets inflict far more serious wounds than conventional ammunition. `` We're very disturbed,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maliniak </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` These bullets are designed to cause as much bodily harm as possible. They cause greater ripping, tearing and death.'' Hollow-point bullets mushroom to the size of a dime upon impact and have the force of a punch to knock a person down, said police spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>. They are far more likely to stop a suspect than round-nose bullets that can pass through someone's body, he said Police Commissioner <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeckmann </PERSON> said statistics show that hollow-points cause no more damage than round-nosed bullets and are less likely to pass through someone's body and ricochet. `` We're getting so many instances of bullets going through people and striking another person,'' <PERSON> Boeckmann </PERSON> said. `` We're all convinced this is an improvement. I see it as something that's safer, by far. The Police Commission approved use of the bullets for a one-year trial period on May 31, said commission President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Talcott </PERSON>. Public protests blocked an attempt by police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> in 1980 to adopt hollow-points, which are used by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other law enforcement agencies nationwide. Critics said they were not notified the issue would be on the commission's agenda May 31 and said they only learned of the decision Friday from a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reporter. `` We would have lobbied against it,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinzun </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll see if we can take legal action for a moratorium and stop it.'' The city is not expected to have the new ammunition available until September, but an interdepartment bulletin advises officers they may purchase the bullets at their own expense at local gun stores.

 Spanish naval authorities immobilized the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship <ORGANIZATION> Sirius </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Ibiza </LOCATION> when it tried to interfere with the entry of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier at nearby <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> island, port officials said Saturday. They said the steering gear of the 152-foot <ORGANIZATION> Sirius </ORGANIZATION> was sealed off by Spanish officials soon after the craft arrived at this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balearic </LOCATION> island port on Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> authorities told the captain, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Engels </PERSON>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Sirius </ORGANIZATION> was to stay in <LOCATION> Ibiza </LOCATION> until further orders and could not set sail or use its rubber rafts, according to the port officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Crewmembers of the USS Dwight <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> carrier turned water hoses on anti-nuclear protesters in four rubber dinghies launched from the Sirius who tried to stop the warship from entering <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> port on Thursday. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> official, said in a communique Thursday the environmental organization was protesting the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government's allowing nuclear weapons into its territorial waters in violation of a March 1986 referendum. Green peace claims the carrier is equipped with nuclear armaments. It is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy not to confirm or deny whether a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship has nuclear weapons. Spaniards voted in 1986 to retain membership in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> with the conditions that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> be free of nuclear weapons, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence be reduced and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s armed forces remain outside the integrated <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military command. Pastor said a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> navy official and two sailors were on duty aboard the Sirius and national police kept watch on the ship from port. `` Nobody informed us on the cause of stopping the ship,'' he said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> had `` attempted to interfere with the docking'' of the carrier but said it anchored successfully without damage or injury to either side.

 A task force of 1,000 police officers set out a dragnet for street gang members again Saturday night after arresting 661 people and seizing drugs and weapons the previous night. The sweeps, major skirmishes in what Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> calls a war on `` the rotten little cowards,'' followed the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen 20 percent this year. `` We're going to do it again and again,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> vowed at a briefing. Most of the task force was concentrated in the south-central and harbor areas, where a total of 327 people were arrested, police said. Of that number, 138 were gang members, police said. Elsewhere, there were 147 arrests in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 105 in the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s area and 82 in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s area. Police said more than half of those arrested were gang members. `` There were definitely a lot of rock -LRB- crack -RRB- cocaine arrests, some arrests for possesion of narcotics for sale, and there were numerous weapons confiscated, including an AK-47 assault rifle,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON>. Those arrested for serious crimes were held at city jails while those picked up on lesser charges were released. The new police report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city this year through the end of May. In the same period a year ago there were 80. In all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> there have been 138 gang-related killings this year. In 1987, gang slayings totaled 387 countywide. The sweep, which began Friday afternoon and ended early Saturday, was the largest since April. Similar anti-gang sweeps have involved several hundred officers at a time in recent weeks. `` We do n't want the public to think we've gone away, so we'll run these periodically to reassure them,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON> `` We're throwing out the big net.'' The last time 1,000 officers were out in force against gangs was April 8 and 9, when Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> ordered them to `` take back the streets'' and <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> declared war on `` the rotten little cowards'' who leave bystanders dead and wounded with their trademark `` drive-by shootings'' from cars. That task force, dubbed Fly the Flag, netted 1,453 arrests during its two days.

 More than 300,000 physicians who treat <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients may be rated in a federal government study on the quality of their patient care, according to a published report.

The study, which would take several years to complete, would rate doctors by name and the results would eventually be made public, the Times said. `` We plan to measure the performance of individual physicians by seeing how well their patients do,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are differences in the quality of care given by physicians and hospitals,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said. `` We can measure those differences, and that information should be conveyed to the public.'' Factors that could be used in rating doctors include such things as mortality rates, speed of recovery and complexity and severity of illnesses, he said. The study would be similar to one done by the federal government on mortality rates of nearly 6,000 hospitals and a forthcoming study on the quality of care in 15,000 nursing homes, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Growing Coca to Find Ways to Destroy It</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal scientists are secretly growing coca as part of an effort to learn how to eradicate the plant from which cocaine is derived, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday's editions that the project has been kept secret because federal officials fear drug dealers or others might threaten the research program or its personnel. Researchers are looking for a reliable chemical or biological means to destroy coca in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> fields, the source of most of the cocaine now reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The best prospect is a herbicide called tebuthurion, manufactured under the trade name <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> by <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Environmentalists have expressed concern that the herbicide could be hazardous to the environment where coca is grown The coca-growing project began about two years ago, according to the Times, which ran photos of plants in a greenhouse near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A reporter viewed experiments, including the processing of coca into cocaine. The newspaper agreed not to publish the identity of the researcher who granted access, the site of the research complex or the federal agencies involved. The project included several hundred coca bushes that were raised from seeds `` flown in from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in diplomatic pouches,'' the researcher told the Times. Four varieties of the plants are being grown, and researchers have found that herbicides that kill one variety may not work against others. `` Coca is very tough stuff,'' the researcher said, pointing out that a herbicide-treated stalk with brown and withered leaves was growing back.

<HEAD>Study: Smokers Have Other Bad Health Habits Too</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Men who smoke a lot are just as likely to be overweight as non-smokers, according to a government study that found heavy smokers to snack a great deal and subject themselves to a variety of other health risks. While smokers generally tended to be less likely than non-smokers to be overweight, that was n't true for men who puffed 35 or more cigarettes daily, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` I was surprised by that,'' <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenborn </PERSON>, of the statistics center, said Friday. `` It may be just a consumption-oriented lifestyle, smoking a lot and eating a lot, for heavier persons,'' she suggested in a telephone interview. The report also said that smokers are more likely than non-smokers to sleep less than six hours daily, to skip breakfast, to be physically inactive and to drink more. People tend to put their health at risk in a number of different ways, and the report found `` more risk-taking behavior and less attention to the healthier practices of life'' among smokers, said <PERSON> Schoenborn </PERSON>. `` Among male smokers, overweight was related to the number of cigarettes smoked daily, but not in the expected direction,'' the report said. `` Prevalence of overweight among males smoking 35 cigarettes or more daily -LRB- 27.2 percent -RRB- was similar to that of males who had never smoked -LRB- 28.1 percent -RRB-.'' By comparison, 19.4 percent of men who smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes daily were overweight. For women, the overweight rate was 24.9 percent for those who had never smoked. Among women smoking more than 35 cigarettes daily, 19.7 percent were overweight, while the rate was 19.3 percent for those smoking 15 or fewer cigarettes. The male group found most likely to be overweight, however, was former smokers, at some 30 percent. For women, 23 percent of former smokers were overweight, more than for smokers but fewer than those who had never smoked. Overall, smokers tended to snack less than non-smokers, <PERSON> Schoenborn </PERSON> said. But heavy smokers consumed more. Some 39.3 percent of men and 37.6 of women who never smoked reported snacking daily. But for folks who smoked 35 or more cigarettes daily _ well over a pack and a half a day _ the snacking rate was 42.5 percent for both sexes. For those smoking less than 15 cigarettes daily, 34.7 percent of men and 32.7 percent of women snacked daily. The report, an analysis of the 1985 National Health Interview Survey, is based on interviews with 91,351 people. It is to be repeated in 1990. While the data in the report were collected three years ago, <PERSON> Schoenborn </PERSON> said that health statisticians `` do n't think the relationships -LRB- among these factors -RRB- change a lot in that period of time.'' Other findings included: _ About one-fourth of smokers reported sleeping six hours or less daily, compared to 21 percent of non-smokers Almost one-third of the heavy smokers sleep less than six hours. _ Skipping breakfast was more common among smokers More than one-third of current smokers said they never ate breakfast, compared with 18 percent of those who had never smoked. _ About 22 percent of smokers said they were less physically active than their contemporaries, compared with 17.2 percent of never smokers Smokers also tended to choose less active leisure activities than non-smokers. _ Heavier smoking was associated with heavier alcohol-drinking About 13 percent of smokers were classified as heavier drinkers, compared with 3.6 percent of those who have never smoked.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says the U.S.-Soviet treaty to abolish medium-range nuclear missiles will work despite his announcement he wo n't be bound by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> restrictions on how to interpret the already ratified accord. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s announcement Friday that he would disregard the conditions drew an angry response from <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. The two lawmakers said the president accepted the language when he and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exchanged the instruments of ratification at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his objections should not have any practical effect on carrying out the treaty, and that any questions about interpretation should be able to be resolved `` in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he was stating his objections to protect the constitutional powers and responsibilities of the president. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. At issue is an amendment attached by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the resolution of ratification that bars future administrations from changing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interpretation of the treaty without prior <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified the treaty May 27. The Democratic-sponsored measure arose from a fight with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over his interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The administration had claimed that the longstanding interpretation of the ABM agreement was too narrow, and should be broadened to allow realistic tests of components of the administration's Star Wars antimissile system. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spelled out his concern in a written statement issued at the White House after he departed for a weekend at Camp David. He said the Senate-passed provision `` apparently seeks to alter the law of treaty interpretation.'' He said the measure would give primary weight to executive branch statements to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, above other sources which international forums and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts would consider in interpreting treaties. `` It subordinates fundamental and essential treaty interpretative sources such as the treaty parties' intent, the treaty negotiating record and the parties' subsequent practices,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said the administration `` does not take the position that the executive branch can disregard authoritative executive statements to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and we have no intention of changing the interpretation of the INF treaty which was presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. ... `` Nonetheless, the principles of treaty interpretation recognized and repeatedly invoked by the courts may not be limited or changed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> alone, and those principles will govern any future disputes over interpretation of the treaty,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, countered: `` The issue is whether any president may subsequently reinterpret treaty provisions in ways contrary to the shared understanding between the executive and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the time the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave its `` The president accepted the condition when he exchanged the instruments of ratification,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat who was involved in crafting the restrictions, also objected to the president's statement, saying, `` The treaty, including this conition, is now the supreme law of the land, and the president can no more change it with a letter than he can change any other law with a letter.'' The INF treaty, approved on a vote of 93-5, will require that the Soviets destroy 1,752 missiles while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> eliminates 867, including both deployed and non-deployed weapons. In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive and stringent verification procedures in arms control history. The key verification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regular basis and through challenges by each side.

<TEXT>
 Democratic platform writers are trying to forge common language on such issues as drugs and civil rights before tackling foreign policy and deficit questions that could divide the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps. The party's drafting committee resumed work today on this scenic island resort. When the panel broke Friday, <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform adviser, complained to reporters: `` It is going too slowly. You do n't know what differences you have until you get down to cold language.'' But Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is chairing the drafting effort, said he wanted the 16 panel members to get acquainted and actually write the document themselves, not `` rubber stamp something that falls from on high.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said afterwards, `` I heard a real strong consensus on the issue of drugs, wanting ... a very strong statement on education, and an even stronger statement on civil rights.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said he was in no hurry to put anything on paper before the Democrats head home Sunday. A draft is needed by June 25-26, when the full 186-member <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for the first time, he said. `` This process begins in <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> and it's going to go through <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> ... and all the way to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, because you do n't have a platform until it's approved by the entire convention,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> opened the <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> meeting with an appeal to write a document that speaks to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families in their kitchens, not to special interests. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> then departed. Both the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps were not satisfied with a 2,000-word blueprint penned by <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, once <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s speechwriter. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> congressman representing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said the platform needs to spell out how the Democrats will deal with AIDS and the homeless. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, one of the drafters, said, `` There should be a plank in this platform that says no person will sleep on the streets of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on grates or on park benches any cold night.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, former chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We have made no decisions about what will go to the floor. We're trying to get so we can draft the first word.'' Asked about reports that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was getting conflicting advice on what demands to press and how hard to fight, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said she knew of no rifts, but added, `` I have to tell you, he keeps his own counsels and makes up his own mind and everybody else really trails behind.'' The <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON> paper, styled as a declaration by `` We the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' denounces `` voodoo economics,'' condemns `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s hateful apartheid, government-sponsored terrorism,'' and mentions in passing the need `` to find more homes and food for those who are homeless and hungry ... and to find more aid for those who have AIDS.'' <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>'s language on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was `` one of the better parts of this document,' but still needs strengthening. `` The motherhood issue of this campaign has been drugs. There probably is more the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people would like to have us say about drugs,'' said <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, suggesting a call for appointment of a Cabinet-level drug czar and mobilizing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and military resources in the fight. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and one of the drafters, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> need `` a platform that any Democrat can run with instead of from,'' not `` a legislative laundry list.'' <PERSON> Booe </PERSON> said the platform should not `` get us tangled up with too many specifics.''

<HEAD>Congressional Panels Reviewing Alleged Drinking Incident at
Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Allegations that the manager of a northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> nuclear power plant was `` disruptive'' in the control room after drinking at a New Year's Eve 1986 party have come under investigation on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, officials say. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the utility that operates the <LOCATION> Davis-Besse </LOCATION> nuclear power plant near <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, said, however, that their own investigation showed the manager was capable of carrying out his responsibilities despite his drinking. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON>, staff director for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, said Friday the panel's review of the incident at <ORGANIZATION> Davis-Besse </ORGANIZATION> is in its early stages. `` We're just taking a look at it preliminarily,'' <PERSON> Scheibel </PERSON> said. A congressional source who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee also has been reviewing the alleged incident for a couple of weeks. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is wrapping up its investigation into the allegations, according to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> initially had accepted the findings of the investigation by <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, but started a new review last July after the agency's resident inspector received more information from plant employees. <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> found that the plant manager had been drinking before arriving at the control room, but concluded: `` It is clear that the individual was in fact fully fit for duty. Accordingly, no disciplinary action is recommended.'' <LOCATION> Davis-Besse </LOCATION>, about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, was shut down for 18 months after a June 9, 1985, incident in which two main and two backup feedwater pumps failed. Operators restarted the pumps and kept the reactor safely covered with cooling water. Since then, the utility has spent about $ 180 million to upgrade the plant. <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said the plant was in the process of starting back up the evening of Dec. 31, 1986, when the manager was called to the site to check progress. `` The allegation was that this manager had been drinking and he was disruptive in the control room,'' <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> submitted a report on the incident to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 19, 1987. The report stated that the manager had been at a New Year's Eve party at which he had consumed alcohol and that when he later went to the control room, he was outspoken and argumentative, <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said. The report quoted a person in the control room as characterizing the manager as `` angry and briefly outspoken'' but that the person did not think it surprising or inappropriate. While the utility's report substantiated that the manager was at the plant shortly after drinking alcohol, it said the allegation that his behavior was distracting was subjective and not substantiated. <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said the utility thoroughly investigated the matter and could find nothing to back up the allegation that the manager had been unfit for duty. <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON> said the manager currently retains his position with the utility. The probe was taken over last October by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, which reviews possible wrongdoing by licensees, said <PERSON> Strasma </PERSON>, who added that a report on the incident was being written.

 House investigators are pondering whether to recommend impeaching <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, who is serving a five-year prison sentence for lying to a federal grand jury but is still drawing his $ 89,500 salary. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> refused to testify during two days of impeachment hearings which ended Friday, but his lawyers claimed he was the innocent victim of `` big prize fever'' among overzealous prosecutors eager to put a federal judge behind bars. Defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> `` has committed no crime and has engaged in no impeachable offense.'' But former federal prosecutor <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was `` aggressively lying'' to a grand jury when he denied he discussed a drug smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> investor with whom he had business dealings. <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had a `` sweetheart deal'' with the investor, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON>, who had sold the judge three profitable oil well properties for bargain prices in 1980. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> paid $ 9,500 for oil and gas rights and reportedly netted $ 55,000 from the deal. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has testified that the transaction was legitimate and that he made no promises of return favors for Fairchild. Although he was accused of discussing the drug charges against Drew Fairchild with the elder Fairchild and a former <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> prosecutor, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> insists that he never talked to anyone about the case. He also says the questions posed during his grand jury appearance were ambiguous. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, 59, a federal judge since 1968 and chief judge of the southern district of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> for the past six years, is serving a five-year prison sentence at <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s appeal of his perjury conviction last January. He can continue to hold office and draw his salary, however, unless he resigns or is convicted at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment trial. Before <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> entered prison in March, the Judicial Conference of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the chief policymaking body of the federal judiciary, reported unanimously to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders that `` consideration of impeachment may be warranted'' in <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s case. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee that conducted impeachment hearings, said his panel would leave the record open for further comments in <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s case until June 14 Shortly after that date, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said, the panel will decide whether to recommend impeachment by the full House. A separate Judiciary subcommittee headed by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., ended three weeks of impeachment hearings Thursday on federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who was acquitted of bribery conspiracy in 1983 <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' fellow judges charged that he actually committed the crime and tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and fabricating evidence at his trial. Neither <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> testified at their impeachment proceedings. The only other federal judge to be indicted while in office was <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, who was imprisoned for tax evasion. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of `` high crimes and misdemeanors'' in October 1986 and removed him from the federal bench.

<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge says he will refuse to accept divorce papers filed only under the initials of couples, but a colleague says the judge should respect their wish for privacy. `` If people are too ashamed to let the world know that they are getting divorced, they should stay married,'' Judge <PERSON> Margarito </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> wrote in a memo to 148th District Court Clerk <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliz </PERSON>. Divorce petitions are public record and appear regularly in many newspapers.

Judge <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> 347th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said he disagrees with <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>'s stance.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is tightening control over its ports of entry and exit to prevent terrorists from passing through, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said. Several suspected Japanese terrorists have been arrested in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and abroad in recent weeks, and an attack in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in April is believed to have been carried out by Japanese radicals.

<HEAD>Court Declines To Allow Aliens to Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government must extend its amnesty deadline for illegal aliens who briefly left the country, a federal judge ruled Friday, but refused to allow ousted aliens to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Both the attorney general and the group representing the aliens, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said they will appeal the ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON>, in an eight-page order, ruled that aliens living in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> who left the country briefly without permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to apply for amnesty through the end of Nov. 30, a six-month extension of the deadline. <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> also ruled that illegal aliens who lived in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, then left the country and were caught and deported when they tried to return should not be allowed to come back. The order, covering 50,000 to 100,000 people nationwide, affects those who left the country after Nov. 6, 1986, when the alien amnesty law took effect. <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON>'s decision was prompted by a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rural Legal Assistance and other immigrant-rights groups. The suit took issue with the definition of the words in the immigration law, `` brief, causal and innocent'' departures. The phrase by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to mean trips of less than 30 days for a legitimate purpose with <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> permission, and that those who left the country without permission would not be eligible for amnesty. The lawsuit contends that many aliens who hurriedly left the country for non-criminal reasons, such as dealing with family emergencies, were improperly denied amnesty eligibility when they returned. The appeal of the ruling is expected to be filed next week in the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Premier Ozal To Pay Historic Visit To Greece</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> will become the first Turkish prime minister in 36 years to go to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> when he flies there Monday on a historic visit to improve ties between the archrivals. His trip was viewed as unlikely to produce any breakthough in major disputes dividing the two <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> countries, but as one high-level Turkish official remarked, `` The visit in itself is a major achievement.'' The last Turkish prime minister to go to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Menderes </PERSON>, later executed after a military coup. He paid a visit in 1952. For <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, 61, the trip is the realization of a goal declared years ago. He said after coming to power in 1983 that he was extending an olive branch to Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and was willing to meet him `` anywhere, any time.'' He suggested that Turks and Greeks put off trying to solve major conflicts and first establish a dialogue aimed at building confidence, with cooperation in areas such as tourism. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> was the architect of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s 1980 economic recovery program, but was considered a novice in diplomacy at the start of his term. The road to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> opened when <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, having rejected any negotiations for seven years, pulled a surprise switch and agreed to meet <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. At the meeting last January, the two accepted a formula for improving relations founded basically on <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s initial offer. The two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies came to the brink of war in March 1987 over oil exploration rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, an event generally believed to have given an impetus to dialogue. In <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> declared their intention to avoid war and decided to set up two committees, one political and the other economic and technical, to start a process of negotiations. Since then the committees have each met once and Turkish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> has visited <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, setting the stage for <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s visit. In a memorandum the two sides pledged to reduce tensions in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION>, cooperate in fighting terrorism and drug smuggling, and refrain from provocative statements. Mayors of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> exchanged visits. Greek Culture Minister <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercouri </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on a goodwill mission. Greek university presidents were invited and feted in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, and Turkish business people went to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to inquire about joint ventures. Yet, the most intractable of their disputes _ over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> _ still overshadows these modest gains. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> boycotted a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> meeting in April to protest the mention of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem in the opening statement, a mention insisted upon by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, a full member of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. One key reason <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> is out to improve ties with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is his known desire to make <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> a full member of the trading bloc by the turn of the century. Many Turks still express apprehension about the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> visit, arguing that <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> will come under pressure to make concessions on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> is divided into southern Greek and northern <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> sectors, where Turkish Cypriots declared independence in 1983. The split came after <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded in 1974, prompted by an Athens-backed coup on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. An estimated 20,000 Turkish troops guard the boundary dividing Greek and Turkish <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Greek policy demands that these troops depart prior to a <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> settlement. Turks say troop removal can only follow a settlement which will protect equal political rights of Turkish Cypriots, one fifth of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>' total population of 750,000. In a recent interview with Turkish daily <ORGANIZATION> Milliyet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> declared, `` Not a single man can be withdrawn as long as there is pressure on us.'' He said he and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> agreed to keep the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem out of the process of reconciliation, but conceded the issue will most likely be raised `` privately'' in their talks. The other major problem, conflicting claims on the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, is more complicated, but Turks hope that as a problem just between themselves it can be more easily solved given time and good will. The Aegean sea is dotted by 3,000 Greek islands, many just a few miles off <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> objects to militarization of the islands, saying that is against international treaties.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he's confident the ethics committee inquiry into his financial dealings will show he has done no wrong, but Republicans are n't waiting to make political hay out of his troubles. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, says the charges against him never would have been raised had the Republicans not needed an issue to deflect the sleaze issue from their presidential candidate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I have absolute confidence that the committee will find that no rule of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has been violated,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's any question but that they're politically motivated. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Friday he had underestimated the amount to which a speaker could become a political target. But if Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials had n't themselves been in ethics trouble, `` I do n't think there would have been a formal charge and all this fanfare,'' he said The ethics committee, consisting of 12 members equally divided between the two parties, unanimously voted to begin an inquiry into six possible violations by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. They included: _ Contacting Egyptian president <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> on behalf of a friend and financial associate when the Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> accords threatened the friend's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil interests _ Intervening with federal officials on behalf of another <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil company which might have had some financial relationships to the speaker _ Whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s campaign financed publication of a book for which the speaker earned $ 55,000 in royalties _ The use of a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffer and office funds to help with the drafting of the book _ The use of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium, owned by the family of a business partner, as his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> home without having to pay a monthly rent The committee was silent on whether it planned to hire an outside counsel to handle the case, as Republicans were demanding. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> unleashed a media blitz on Friday to refute the allegations in the investigation even before they were announced at mid-day. He spent nearly two hours answering questions from print and broadcast reporters and released documents and a long narrative account of his actions. `` My goal, and just about my only professional goal in living at this point, is to be a good and effective public servant,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asserted in the conclusion of his narrative. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., who triggered the ethics committee actions by filing a formal complaint, said he hoped the probe would show that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` is an essentially decent man who was sloppy'' in his business dealings But he added, `` I think having <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> third in line to be president and having <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with the powers of the speakership is very, very dangerous to the processes of this country.'' In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state GOP convention, national party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said the charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would give Republicans a `` level playing field'' in the fall election. `` If the Democrats are going to ... raise some kind of a sleaze factor ... they've got to realize that people who live in glass houses should n't throw stones,'' he said. In a statement released in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where he was presiding over a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> unity conference, <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said: `` The mounting questions underscore the need for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to establish and report the facts to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. However, more is required. Nothing less than a public investigation directed by an outside counsel will satisfy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s right to open and honest government.

<HEAD>International Arrest Warrant Issued For Former Nazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A French investigating magistrate has issued an international arrest warrant for <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, one of the last major <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> war criminals still at large. He is believed to be living in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, 76, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>'s right-hand man, was commander of the Drancy transit camp from which thousands of French Jews and Resistance members were deported to concentration camps or extermination centers. The arrest warrant was issued Friday by Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Grellier </PERSON> and follows a complaint filed Dec. 4, 1987 accusing <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> of crimes against humanity, specifically the kidnapping and murder of minors. French lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hunter <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON> has entered the case as a civil party representing an organization called the Sons and Daughters of the Jewish Deportees of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON>, along with his wife, <PERSON> Beate </PERSON> led the successful battle to have <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, known as the Butcher of <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, brought to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> in 1983. <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> was convicted of crimes against humanity last July and sentenced to life in prison. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> no longer has a death penalty. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> was tried and convicted in absentia in 1954 for war crimes and sentenced to death. That sentence is no longer valid because the 20-year statute of limitations has expired. However, there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity. The charges against <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> involve the arrest of about 200 children, which the Sons and Daughters group says was carried out July 20, 1944, and their deportation to the gas chambers at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> in Nazi-held <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Klarsfelds in 1982 said they had found <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have previously asked for his extradition, but the Syrian government has never acted.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Ivy League presidential candidates from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, are striving to educate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s voters about each other's liabilities. The game of political one-upmanship escalated when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cried foul over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new attack strategy aimed at exposing the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as a left-wing liberal. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Friday that the vice president's game plan is `` a losing strategy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, appearing at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` United'88'' conference here, retorted, `` I wo n't be deterred from telling the truth.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> engaged in long-distance insult-trading, setting a likely tone for the general election campaign between the two virtually certain nominees, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was complaining that too much has been made of what he wants as the runner-up to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Democratic competition. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, taking a working vacation at a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> resort, complained that such questions about his ambitions are `` demeaning, disrespectful and contemptuous.'' And on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Democrat platform writers voiced confidence that the desires of both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can be accommodated. Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, however, warned against producing a document that would amount to `` the Yellow Pages _ an ad for every organized group.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, chafing under heavy <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticism in recent weeks about the vice president's performance in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's handling of the drug problem, went on the attack Thursday in a speech to the state Republican convention in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He charged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with concealing a leftist-leaning political orientation with `` moderate tones'' and with being born of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> boutique'' school of liberalism. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received an undergraduate degree in political science from <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION> before graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He also has many advisers with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> ties. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received an undergraduate degree in political science from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he was n't making a class argument against the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. Instead, he said, he was trying to say that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> is `` a kind of philosophical enclave. ... I see this as a philosophical cult normally identified with extremely liberal causes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, is `` so diffuse,'' he said. `` There is n't a symbol. ... Harvard boutique to me, at least, has the connotation of liberalism and elitism.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to engage reporters in a discussion of his political roots, although his campaign had said in advance of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech Thursday that they expected a `` mudslinging'' strategy by the Republican. Asked to respond Friday to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I do n't. I'm going to campaign on the issues. I'm going to talk about the future.'' Asked if he would bring up <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> background, the governor said: `` I'm really not interested. I do n't think the American people are interested. I think it's a losing strategy.'' For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was offering no apologies in his speech before the heavily partisan crowd of western state Republicans in a Hyatt Regency Hotel ballroom. He said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` have been out there dumping on me for six months. They can dish it out, but now let's see if they can take it.'' Four of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vanquished <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rivals shared the stage with the vice president, urging Republicans to unify behind the ticket this fall. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was warmly greeted by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> sent a letter saying he could not make the meeting, but that he thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` earned and deserves'' the support of his conservative followers Said Haig: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a candidate of radical and dangerous change. In Third World affairs, he is the reincarnation of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> he did not think his supporters would turn away from the Democratic ticket if he is not on it. `` They're not given to trauma easily,'' he said. `` My constituency will have a broad view of the many considerations. They do not have a fixation on one position. There is much to be considered.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Friday anti-American riots in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> are an `` internal'' South Korean problem and do not threaten <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces there. `` I got no sense whatsover that our forces were in any jeopardy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. On the contrary, I received nothing but warm hospitality everywhere I went,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said at a news conference a day after arriving here from visits to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> following the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` One would have thought that if there were any risk to our soldiers, there would be some demonstrations against me, and there were none,'' he said. `` I think what we're seeing is limited in scope. It's an internal Korean matter and not appropriate for me to comment on.'' In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Friday, riot police firing tear gas blocked thousands of radical students from marching to communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for reunification talks. The radicals claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with its 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, enforces partition to rule the South. Protests throughout <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> were bitterly anti-American. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for annual U.S.-South Korean security consultations at which security for the 1988 Summer Olympics also was discussed. Of his talks with his Soviet counterpart at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he hoped real gains had been made between the superpowers, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not let its guard down in the face of friendly gestures from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We have yet to see perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- impact the Soviet military establishment,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` It would be certainly premature and the height of folly now for us to throw up our hands and say all is well while the Soviet military machine continues to roll on.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has adopted a `` losing strategy'' for the fall campaign and the vice president's rival says he will focus on the issues despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal attacks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his party's certain presidential nominee, also said Friday that it was `` much too early'' to ask him about potential running mates. And, taking a position likely to feed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' foreign policy views, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would move the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> if he was elected and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> continued to recognize <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, today was to address a friendly audience at the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> convention, being held to formally bestow an endorsement on the re-election bid of Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass.

At first, he offered a blunt `` I do n't'' when asked how he planned to respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks. He then went on to say: `` I'm going to campaign on the issues ... I'm going to talk about the future.'' Later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and has many advisers with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> ties, laughed when asked if he would point out <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s own Ivy League background.

I think that's a losing strategy.'' Democratic rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been pressing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to offer him the No. 2 spot on the ticket. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met his criteria for the spot, said it was `` much too early'' to respond. `` The process has just begun,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This will take several weeks.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, a law school classmate of the governor, is heading the search, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he hopes to complete prior to the Democratic National Convention in mid-July. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent a good portion of a media briefing dancing around the question of whether he would move the embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers to be its capital. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies should `` go where the host nation says its capital is,'' adding later that the policy was a `` regular rule of diplomatic courtesy.'' Later, when pressed for a direct answer on whether he would move the embassy if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintained <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was its capital, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` If <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> determined that that's where it wants its capital then that is its capital.

 A Soviet delegation has spent two weeks in capitalist <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> studying the social welfare system to see whether any aspect could be used to reform the Soviet economic and social system. `` We are not here to copy, we are here to find efficient methods that, within our socialistic system, are the most efficient for our social development,'' Vice Finance Minister <PERSON> Viacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Senchagov </PERSON> said Friday as the delegation ended its visit. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is a capitalist country, but its taxes are among the world's highest. Tax income finances welfare programs which health, child care and education free for everyone and guarantees liveable retirement pensions. Soviet economic experts and bureacrats examined the Swedish retraining programs, the tax system, the labor exchange and cooperative companies. They also visited factories and farms. Delegates said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' policy was now in its most active stage It was most important to increase production while safeguarding social goals, they said. Perestroika means restructuring in Russian and is a buzzword for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program which seeks to reform the Soviet economy and social system. `` We are looking for a tax system to stimulate innovation and how to use taxes to get work collectives to use the socialist property in the best way,'' <PERSON> Senchagov </PERSON> told a news conference. Speaking through an interpreter, he said the danger of perestroika was that it might create economic inequality. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, incomes are equalized by a progressive taxes that takes as much as 78 percent in the top tax brackets. The delegation arrived to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> on May 29 at the invitation of social democratic Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>. It was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today. Another member of the group, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, Director of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION>, described the Swedish model as dynamic and efficient. `` The social motives and humanistic goals in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> ... are very attractive to us, and we sympathize with the system,'' he said. Asked why the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had started turning to capitalistic countries for ideas <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON> said `` there is nothing peculiar about the fact that we after 70 years turn to other countries.'' `` The Socialistic system is open for all positive things in the world,'' he said. Head of delegation, <PERSON> Anatoliy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miliukov </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s extensive labor exchange and retraining programs, which include government subsidies to companies that give workers time off for study, were of great interest. He said that as a result of perestroika the number of officials at various ministries are being cut down sharply and that in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> alone the number of employed in half of the ministries had been cut by 30-40 percent. `` We have retired a lot of these people, others have been transferred to other institutions, for instance to research,'' <PERSON> Miliukov </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> needs radical reforms and faces years of social upheaval before its economic and social crisis will end, a private Hungarian think tank said. In a separate discussion on state television, a top Communist party official revealed that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic woes meant that its defense commitments to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact were not increased this year, and will not grow in real terms through 1990. In a report Friday, the state news agency, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, summarized what it said were the results of a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a former state institute that went private last year after Communist authorities threatened to close it for its critical analyses. The new analysis, entitled `` Reports From the Tunnel,'' said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` now faces a criticial situation externally and internally'' because reforms begun in the late 1960s did not go far enough in dismantling centralized state control over the economy. `` Production is growing ever more slowly, the situation of small business has become less stable, the inflationary pressure remains, the ` self-restraint' by companies about price increases will not last long and the efforts to curb budgetary spending have not been successful,'' said <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Csillag </PERSON>, deputy head of the research company. Inflation has already touched 18 percent in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year, and many experts expect it to go higher. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Csillag </PERSON> as saying that the currently favorable assessment of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s prospects abroad will soon change unless more reform is adopted. With a gross hard currency debt of $ 18 billion, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is highly dependent on Western assessments of its performance and reforms to gain further credits from governments, banks and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as saying significant changes were needed, including a shift to satisfying overall market demand rather than selected markets and new forms of ownership. If such changes were implemented, the report said, `` then we may be out of the present critical situation in five to eight years' time. But it noted that this would only occur `` at a price of the upheavals that structural change will entail.'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted the firm's manager, <PERSON> Marton </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardos </PERSON>, as saying it was necessary to create popular support for changes even if they entailed unemployment and other unpopular reductions in the social support mechanism. Until the mid-1980s, unemployment was unknown in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which like other Soviet bloc nations touted full employment as one of the achievements of Communism. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and other east European nations have now admitted that people employed in unprofitable state enterprises will have to face at least temporary job loss as state subsidies are shifted from the loss-making firms to more profitable enterprises. One area of Communist budgets that so far has seemed immune from cuts has been defense. But Politburo member <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> indicated on Hungarian television Thursday night that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic woes have also affected military spending. He said 1987 defense spending, including costs for <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> militia and for clothing and housing soldiers totaled about $ 1 billion. The real value of defense spending was not increased in 1988, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said, declining to give figures. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact commitments also were not increased as in the past, but kept the same in real terms, <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> said. Again, he provided no figures.

<HEAD>Government Fines Hunter In East Texas Lion Safaris</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man's land is his kingdom, but the law stepped in when <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>'s commercial lion hunts expanded to government marshland in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to put constraints on what he can do on his own property,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we are concerned with safety.'' <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> says he has led paying hunters on six lion safaris this year at his 400-acre island about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He wo n't say where he got the lions. Government officials became involved when two lion carcasses were found on government land across a roughly half-mile-wide shallow river from <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>'s isolated island. The government land is intended for a reservoir and was being managed by the corps. At least one lion was believed to have been released, hunted and skinned on government property, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>, a corps ranger who usually monitors compliance with grazing and oilfield leases. Federal officials were unnerved by the idea of lions roaming free followed by hunters with high-powered weapons on land usually used by duck hunters and nature buffs. `` I had a long talk with him,'' <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> said. `` He indicated to me that he was not going to hunt any more lions down there.'' Opposition to such lion hunts has come from as far away as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, executive director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` People are appalled that something like this could happen,'' she said. `` It's becoming a common problem across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> with a surplus of lions, who breed well in captivity.'' In the absence of regulations specifically forbidding lion hunts on private land, authorities fined <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> $ 125 for disposing of an animal carcass on government land and conducting a business for profit on government property, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. In addition, a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ranger who accompanied <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> to <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>'s taxidermy shop April 29 fined <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> $ 110 for not having a license to mount migratory wildfowl. The lions <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> used probably were bred in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinebaugh </PERSON>, senior resident <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and Wildlife enforcement agent for south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He added, `` once they're here, they can be bought, sold, killed, whatever.'' Under state law, even African lions are not considered wildlife resources and therefore are not protected from hunters, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a regulatory coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The lions were brought to the island in cages, released and then tracked across the private property in hunts lasting as little as 20 minutes, <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said. His price list for the hunts ranged from $ 2,500 to $ 3,000. `` Once that lion is released, there is no catching him back again,'' he said. `` I'm obligated to kill him. I ca n't have the liability of a lion running around. `` They made it sound like we were releasing lions in that part of the country, hoping we'd find them,'' <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said. `` When the cat was released, it never left our sight.'' <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said his customers had no preconceived notions about the hunt on the island, which is covered by low vegetation. `` They knew they were n't in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, they knew they were n't hunting for a free lion,'' he said `` If they wanted that, they could go to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Use of Herbicide Halted Except In Limited Instances In Northwest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says the last two manufacturers of a weedkiller that can cause birth defects must stop selling the herbicide, but the agency will allow short-term continued use on some food products in three Northwestern states. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> on Friday announced the agency has reached a settlement with the two makers of the herbicide dinoseb that would halt most current sales and distribution of the product. But the government has said <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, both near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, can sell their existing stock for use during the rest of this year on dry peas, lentils, chickpeas and green peas in the states of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The remaining stock may be used in 1988 and 1989 on berries in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> decided to allow limited continued use of dinoseb into 1989 although it can cause birth defects and poses a hazard to men's ability to have children. <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said there is no substitute herbicide to treat weeds affecting certain plants in the Northwest. Certain crops `` would have been rather devastated'' if the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had banned the weedkiller altogether, said <PERSON> Heier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> characterized the exceptions as small and said the tight restrictions were designed to protect people from exposure to the chemical. Several environmental groups had opposed any further sales of the weedkiller and any provision allowing for the use of existing supplies. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated it would cost $ 40 million to purchase all existing supplies of dinoseb from chemical companies and another $ 155 million to dispose of it as federal law requires. Friday's agreement came as a result of a challenger by Cedar and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> emergency ban of dinoseb issued in October 1986.

<HEAD>USDA Scientist Tells New Process for Removing Pesticides</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pesticides and antibiotics can be removed from laboratory samples of animal tissues through the use of heated and pressurized gases that act like liquids, a government scientist says. The experimental process may be used by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the future in its testing of domestic and imported meat for chemical residues, chemist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. His remarks to the Third Chemical Congress of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> being held in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> were made available by the department Some pesticides sprayed on crops are believed to cause cancer and other serious health problems. The chemical residues remain on grain used for livestock feed and can remain in meat products that are taken to market. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies are required to inspect meat to make sure that it does not contain such residues in excess of governmentally set tolerances. Antibiotics are regularly fed to livestock to prevent disease and can remain in animal tissues. The new process for removing pesticides and antibiotics is called `` supercritical extraction,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. He described supercritical fluids as gases, such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, heated and compressed to densities that resemble those of liquids but actually represent an intermediate state between liquid and gas. The process has been used for several years to decaffeinate coffee, extract hops for flavoring beer and refine spice, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. King said supercritical extraction removed nearly 100 percent of the pesticides in laboratory samples of lard that were deliberately spiked with five well-known pesticides: lindane, endrin, heptachlor, TED and dieldrin. `` Right now, we use this method for analytical purposes, such as measuring the amount of pesticide in animal fat tissue,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` But some day it could end the use of harmful chemical solvents used in laboratory extraction. It would eliminate the problem of solvent waste disposal and be safer for technicians who routinely perform such extractions on a daily basis.''

 Brace yourself for the latest farm product with an official `` awareness week.''

Goat milk is sometimes used as an alternative for those allergic to cow milk. Not surprisingly, processors are hoping to enlarge their market. The industry reports sales of $ 100 million a year from the 84 million pounds of milk produced by the nation's goat herd. That compares to around 140 billion pounds of cow milk produced annually in this country. Raw goat milk is available in various parts of the country, to say nothing of the pasteurized, powdered and evaporated variety, and the goat milk in cheese, ice cream and yogurt. Goat milk is also sometimes used as an ingredient in soap. The federal government provides $ 4 million annually for projects at nine universities involving production of goat milk.

 From a blimp floating over the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, a proposed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government television service would beam a daily diet of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news shows, sitcoms and soap operas to the people of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

Cuban-Americans have been pushing the project as a natural and more effective follow-up to the radio service that is named for <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> patriot <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and devotes its air time to promoting the cause of freedom in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would be a much more powerful medium'' for informing Cubans about world events as well as what is happening in their own country, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON>, chairman of the presidential advisory board for <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION>. A program mix of American, Mexican and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> comedy, variety and soap operas would easily draw Cuban viewers, he said. `` They are anxious to learn about the outside world,'' said <PERSON> Mas </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which helped found <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>. The Radio <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> advisory board recently completed a feasibility study on television broadcasting to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Radio signals can easily reach the island 90 miles off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but TV broadcasting would be more difficult because of the nature of the signals. A TV transmitter would have to be high enough to be in direct line of sight of the island. The advisory board said the most feasible option would be to transmit the signal from a blimp floating over the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> predicts that TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would be even more successful than the radio service, which Radio Marti officials estimate reaches about a quarter of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s 10 million people.

<TEXT>
 Disagreements among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers meeting here today could cut as much a $ 2 off the price of a barrel of oil, benefiting consumers the world over, analysts say. One faction of the oil-producing group is pushing for a cut in production. A Western-oriented camp is bracing to block the move. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> want a production cut to keep oil prices at $ 18 a barrel. But a Saudi Arabia-led group has opposed the idea, which failed to gain the support of oil ministers at this week's Arab Summit in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Twelve of the 28-year-old cartel's members agreed in December to extend a quota of 15 million barrels a day until June 30. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, refused to sign the accord because it demanded a production quota equal to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s. Now, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> are so divided over production controls that many analysts expect them to fight over the issue for at least a week _ and then give up. They were expected simply to extend the existing quota until the end of the year. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustein </PERSON>, a New York-based oil trader who was to observe the meeting, says the disagreement will cause oil prices to fall. `` It's going south, which of course, is great for the consumer,'' <PERSON> Neustein </PERSON> said. Some analysts said the lack of a new accord could force prices down by as much as $ 2 a barrel below the organization's target of $ 18. The oil markets also showed little confidence in the ministers' ability to reach a consensus The July contract price of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude oil, fell 34 cents to $ 16.73 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. That was its lowest level in more than two months. In addition, the cartel nations are doing little to help boost the price. Currently, they are producing an estimated 18.5 million barrels a day, 3.4 million barrels a day more than their agreement allows. The majority camp, led by <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, wants to cut production to push oil prices up nearer <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target price. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> ideally would like to cut production jointly with the interested producers outside the cartel. The non-OPEC members involved in the dialogue with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is attending the meeting as observer, while <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is not represented. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> aggressively backed an unsuccessful attempt by non-OPEC producers in late April to get the cartel to agree to cut production. A minority of four <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations, led by heavyweight <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest producer _ blocked that attempt at the extraordinary <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting six weeks ago at which no new agreement was reached. At the mid-year meeting, the minority opponents of the plan, again led by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, want to boost production to match predictions of an increase in demand in the last six months of 1988, analysts said. However, the cartel's members do n't even agree on how large demand will be. Estimates range from 17.6 million barrels a day to 18.9 million barrels a day. In the first half of the year, demand was 17.7 million barrels a day, analysts say.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded a contract for two of this year's fast-attack submarines to a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company and indicated <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> can win the third sub only if it lowers its price. The <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 612 million contract on Friday to build two SSN-688 Los Angeles-class submarines, scheduled to be completed in August 1993. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> outbid Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said it would negotiate with Electric Boat to get a lower price on the third submarine, <PERSON> Cullin </PERSON> said. The announcement is a disappointment for <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>, which lost out on last year's fast-attack sub competition 4-0 to its Virginia-based arch rival. Both companies rely heavily on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials told Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., that <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> raised its bid at the final stage of the contract competition, a time when companies usually lower their offers, said <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> aide Chip Partner It was not known why Electric Boat hiked its price. Electric Boat spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> declined comment. In a prepared statement, the company said the loss illustrates that price `` is the acknowledged driver in today's defense industry environment,'' and that <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> will have to lower labor costs to compete with <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Electric Boat is in negotiations with unionized workers for a new contract. The current contract expires June 30. `` The major cost in our submarine construction is labor. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, our competitor, has lower labor costs. Today's announcement is a clear mandate for <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> to hold labor costs in line and to re-examine all possible options to lowering other key costs elements,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> in a prepared statement issued Friday. <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said it was `` too early'' to assess the potential impact on employment. Union officials could not be reached late Friday for comment. The SSN-688 submarine, a 6,900-ton vessel as long as a professional football field, is designed to hunt down enemy surface ships and subs. They are armed with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> 48 anti-submarine torpedoes, Harpoon missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles. The two sub builders have been competing for the fast-attack sub contracts since the first award in 1970. Electric Boat has won 31 SSN-688 contracts. Friday's awards brings <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>' total up to 27. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> won all four fast-attack submarines awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> won all four contracts. The sub contracts are enormously important to the shipyards. Electric Boat is the region's largest private employer, with 18,000 workers at its main plant in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and 6,000 at its yard in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has more than 26,000 workers at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shipyard. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnaedter </PERSON> said: `` A contract of this size adds a certain degree of long-range stability to our work force, and it's good news for the yard to get two of them.''

<HEAD>Results of Farm Credit Legislation Still Not Clear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 initially appeared to be a lifeline for ranchers and farmers drowning in debt to federal loan programs. Yet five months after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the bill and federal officials hailed it as a critical step toward helping rural landowners hold onto their acres, `` the jury is still out'' for thousands of borrowers on billions of dollars in delinquent loans. In the first quarter of this year, the act helped 8,500 `` distressed'' loans to be restructured so farmers and ranchers could keep their properties, according to <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. But many other farmers owe their money to the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, whose regulations under the act are not yet settled, and some have been unable to apply for the aid provided by the landmark legislation. The borrower-owned Farm Credit System of banks and lending cooperatives lost $ 4.8 billion from 1985 through last year, said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Beesley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the Farm Credit System. The system's problems, coupled with land devaluation and low crop prices, were forcing thousands of farms onto the auction block, <PERSON> Beesley </PERSON> said. The act provides up to $ 4 billion in federal funds to financially troubled farm credit institutions through 1992, protecting farmers' stock in those banks and cooperatives. It also requires farm loans to be restructured _ changing the terms in some way so the debt can still be repaid _ if that would cost less than foreclosure. Until the legislation passed, loan restructuring was a voluntary effort, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now the law says, ` You will restructure.''' `` I think it's working just fine,'' <PERSON> Beesley </PERSON> said of the legislation. `` Investors have greater confidence in the system, and so do borrowers. We're very pleased with the act.'' But at the office of the Coalition to Save Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, based in this plains town in northeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the hotline rings steadily. `` It's sort of a big question mark,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON>, who estimated he had fielded hundreds of calls about the act. `` Because of the complexities in borrowing practices, what happens in one lending institution could affect them in another federal institution.'' The major stumbling block in the process arises from the structure of the federal lending agencies and the pattern of how farmers borrow. Many farmers have multiple loans spread among the various lenders. The 37 Farm Land Banks, for example, make long-term land loans, and the 387 lending cooperatives known as Production Credit Associations make short-term operating loans. Those agencies come under the Farm Credit System. But the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which makes both types of loans, is supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, and rules for the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> are still in the public approval process. The FmHA has balked at going along with restructuring plans for borrowers that hold its loans as well as others, fearing vulnerability. `` I had a case over in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> where the lender at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said they would work anything out with the farmer, as long as the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> would agree to it,'' <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> said. `` FmHA could n't agree to anything because the rules and regulations were n't out yet _ and they do n't know what they can agree to.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaugh </PERSON>, a consultant who helps farmers with restructuring, predicted it might take until January for the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> to be absorbed into the act. `` Until then, anyone with a <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan is just in limbo,'' he said. `` It's just putting a litte bit of a shadow on our efforts out there because they -LRB- FmHA -RRB- are not ready to sit down at the table and negotiate about restructuring.'' So far this year, <PERSON> Slaugh </PERSON> says he has saved 10 farms by restructuring loans. He is working on about 50 more with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, a former farmer and his partner in Ag Management Consultants, based in Grand Junction. The company has a contract with the state's rural job training program to help indebted farmers. It also has clients with loans from <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, district. Slaugh estimated that those banks hold about 40,000 loans in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and that 4,000 of them are distressed, meaning they are delinquent or potentially deliquent. That's about half as many as a few years ago. `` The new legislation has given us more tools,'' he said. `` At this point, the jury is still out. We've had some success _ not as much as we'd like to see. -LRB- But -RRB- compared to when we started three years ago, it's a world of difference.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutschenritter </PERSON>, vice president of special credit for the Farm Credit System in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, said his agency last year opened a special credit department for distressed loans and was able to `` bring back'' about 45 percent of 5,000 loans so families could stay on their farms, he said. For farmers and ranchers with distressed loans, the crucial step is to respond quickly to notices from lenders, warned <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stencel </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a grass-roots general farm organization with 18,000 members in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` Borrowers are currently receiving letters from the Farm Credit System advising them of their rights to ask for their loans to be restructured,'' <PERSON> Stencel </PERSON> said. `` If borrowers do n't respond within 45 days, Farm Credit can begin foreclosure. `` If farmers miss the deadline, they still have the right to request restructuring, but the cost of foreclosure may diminish chances of restructuring as -LRB- the less expensive -RRB- alternative.'' Agriculture attorneys <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shively </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON>, partners with offices near the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, see the 1987 legislation as a tool _ particularly because it obligates the lender to notify the borrower before any foreclosure action is taken. `` We have found ... farmers as a group have always been hard-working, God-fearing people who have paid their debts, and now they find they ca n't pay their debts,'' <PERSON> Dworkin </PERSON> said. `` And when you have to ask that type of an individual to file bankruptcy, you get tremendous resistance. But farmers today `` have to be aware of every single government program and use it to the max,'' he said. They also must know what it takes to grow cattle or crops _ and be good money managers, too, he said. Many farmers in trouble today meet those criteria, but bad weather and the economy bring them to the Rural Coalition, consultants like <PERSON> Slaugh </PERSON> and attorneys who are experts in agricultural law. `` The legislation will be beneficial, but it wo n't eliminate the farm crisis,'' <PERSON> Gutschenritter </PERSON> said. `` A positive income situation _ better prices _ is what is needed. `` I think it's going to be a much wiser farm credit system as a result of these times. It will make us tougher, better farmers.''

<TEXT>
 Over the past two decades <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry has shucked a lot of its old bad habits, and now is the better for having done so. Looking back, it's evident that the change was n't motivated so much by enthusiasm as by fear _ by the fear, for example, that foreign manufacturers might steal not just foreign markets but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets too. Old habits are comfortable habits, and many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies preferred the old ways and so disappeared from the scene. So did typically American products, such as television sets and calculators. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> took over the business. Some industries fought back, cutting their corporate bureacracies, closing inefficient operations, ending waste, resolving labor-management battles, updating factories with robots and electronic controls. In short, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry in the past 15 years or so has become leaner, smarter, meaner and more competitive. Still, there remains a gaping weakness that could offset many of the modern improvements. That weakness is the inability of many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to rapidly transform new technology, much of it developed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, into profitable products. That in itself would be reason to worry, but there is an added dimension to the problem: Quick transformation, or exploitation, is the very skill of some Japanese and other Asian producers of high-technology products. More than half of over 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executives, academics and state officials surveyed recently said that a major barrier to competitiveness is the excessive time lag in converting technology to new commercial products. That study, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, found that an old bugaboo of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial management might be a primary source of the problem. That bugaboo: the seeming inability of American business to focus on long-term goals, to have a distant vision of the future rather than a nearsighted fixation on the short term. It does n't take a study to realize two of the reasons why: _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> corporate executives are paid and promoted for turning out products today, not tomorrow. Ironically, in focusing on `` today's'' products, they end up turning out those of yesterday. Competitors beat them. A flow of products results from long-term rather than short-term goals. Yet, according to the survey, American business still indicates a tendency to become impatient with the long-term view. _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> industry is under constant pressure to produce profits now, not tomorrow. Executives have a limited time in which to prove themselves. While they might believe that a corporate shakeup will show results five years down the road, they must deal with the possibility they might be fired before then. Therefore, they go with what they consider the tried and true and often old-fashioned products. In addition, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment climate is such that Wall Street brokers demand immediate results. In fact, there is pressure on executives of some companies to show results not in the next year but in the next quarter or two. It creates a baffling paradox, one that American industry must resolve if it is to keep pace with the often smaller, more agile entrepreneurs of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Market Awaits New Junk Bond Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Traders and investors alike are scrounging for new junk in the credit markets. They are eagerly awaiting the high-yield, high-risk junk bonds that will be issued to help finance many of the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place recently on the corporate takeover trail. `` There have been a number of deals completed in the last two months where it is anticipated that -LRB- junk bond -RRB- financing will be accomplished,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahood </PERSON>, a high-yield bond analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. He said British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> is likely to use junk bonds to finance at least some of his $ 1.7 billion buyout of the Pittsburgh-based cement company, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` And <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is almost certain to come to market at some point,'' he added, referring to the $ 2.5 billion leveraged buyout of the company that is being led by <ORGANIZATION> Kelso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. It also is anticipated that <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> retailer <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> will raise more than $ 1 billion through the sale of junk bonds to facilitate his acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> also is likely to rely on junk bonds to finance the spinoff of <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>'s supermarket chain as a subsidiary `` Some of the takeovers do create very large issues, and that alone is a sudden injection of product into the market,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waill </PERSON>, a managing director at <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Unterberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Towbin </PERSON>. `` In terms of getting business going, I suppose it's good _ it does create a certain amount of motion,'' he said. A slowdown in mergers and acquisitions since the market crash resulted in a reduced supply of new junk bond issues. `` That may be contributing to the richness of the market,'' <PERSON> Dahood </PERSON> said referring to the high prices at which are selling and trading. Conversely, yields on many of these debt issues are not as handsome as they have been historically. <PERSON> Dahood </PERSON> characterized current returns as `` rather skimpy.'' When comparing relative yields, `` the junk bond market is providing a rather skimpy incremental return to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> market at the 10-year issuance,'' he said. Because high-yield debt securities often are issued for 10-year terms, they typically are measured against the 10-year Treasury bill. Junk bonds currently are trading about 425 to 475 basis points above the 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill, which is hovering just under 9 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In the past, however, junk bonds have traded as much as 600 basis points above the government security, and, more recently, 500 to 550 basis points above, <PERSON> Dahood </PERSON> said. Putting it another way, `` the premium for accepting the risk today is somewhat smaller than it has been,'' he noted. In addition to the takeover issues that might revive the market, some analysts say corporations are being driven to lock in fixed-rate debt as overall interest rates move higher. `` Companies that launched leveraged buyouts late last year and financed them with bank and bridge loans at floating rates are now getting nervous as interest rates move up,'' noted <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessol </PERSON>, managing director of industrial rating at <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. One attractive option is to sell fixed-rate public debt Despite the high level of risk associated with junk bonds and allegations of scandal and wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the pioneer in junk-bond underwriting, investor interest remains keen. Some estimate there are some $ 160 billion in outstanding junk bonds, with as much as 10 percent held by individuals as opposed to institutional investors. A surge in junk-bond mutual funds is also making the high-yield instrument more accessible to the average investor. Quoting from a recent government study, <PERSON> Dahood </PERSON> said there were 23 junk bond mutual funds in 1981 with assets of $ 3.1 billion; by Sept. 30, 1987, the number had mushroomed to 72, and their assets totaled more than $ 30 billion.

<HEAD>Central Bankers, Others Paint Picture Of Economic Stability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A gathering of top-level executives from the world's biggest banks produced a picture of economic harmony, supported by improved trade, stable exchange rates and healthy growth. While few economists would dispute those assertions, made this past week at the 34th annual <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, many agreed the current state of affairs, particularly involving currencies, was more a product of inertia than policymaking. `` Policy is on hold,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` The policymakers are kind of hemmed in. They do n't know what to do.'' <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> made it clear during the three-day <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> meeting that he did n't want the dollar to fall any further, for fear it could harm ongoing attempts to reduce the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told a separate press briefing the `` adjustment process,'' by which the dollar has been allowed to depreciate over the past three years to enhance the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade picture by making exports less expensive abroad, `` has made significant progress.'' But he said since manufacturers already are running at or near capacity levels due to healthy export growth, further dollar declines would n't help them sell more goods overseas or anywhere else, facilitating inflationary pressures. <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Larosiere </PERSON> publicly agreed with <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> also made assurances that his country was n't trying to drive down the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, discounting recent dollar sales as a routine effort to trim dollar reserves. Other central bankers at the conference included: Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh-Pemberton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> Director General <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohta </PERSON>, deputy governor for international relations for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. Some currency traders and economists remained skeptical about the underlying motives of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and about how long the major industrialized nations could maintain stability. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` There seems to be an emerging technical reason for the dollar to be on the firm side in the next month or so,'' partly due to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural sales to the Soviets and Chinese. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> might privately be `` trying to temper the upward pressure of the dollar that might emerge. A rise in the dollar, should it occur, would bring instability in the markets because it's not sustainable.'' Economists say the upbeat picture publicly presented by the central bankers this past week amounted to an `` open-mouth policy'' clearly aimed at maintaining the narrow trading range for currencies that has existed in recent months. `` There's PR and hot air involved here ... They want to enhance the view that they are unified in the open. They prefer the status,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. But there are drawbacks to resisting change, economists say. For one thing, `` there's no lure to foreign capital to make currency gains on their dollar holdings,'' said <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>. `` As long as they hold the dollar in this narrow trading range you have monetary policy effectively transmitted as though it were a fixed-rate system,'' said <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>. `` And even though the rates in this sytem are ` fixed' they're not really fixed and you ca n't be sure the floor under the dollar is solid and dependable.'' The currency markets have been trading on a `` floating rate'' system since early 1973, following about three decades of fixed rates that grew out of the historic post-World War II <LOCATION> Bretton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> agreement. The stage was set for a drop in the dollar in September 1985, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its four major trading partners agreed to devalue the currency to help reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade shortfall and stave off protectionist legislation. Last year, however, that same group agreed that further decines in the dollar's value would be `` counterproductive.'' In the last three years, the dollar has lost half its value against such currencies as the West German mark and Japanese yen. It has fallen less against the currencies of such major trading partners as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Glut Of Frozen Pork Bellies Is Good News For BLT Lovers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Lovers of bacon-lettuce-and-tomato sandwiches may be inclined to add an extra layer of bacon to their BLTs this summer. A glut of frozen pork bellies forced futures prices into a virtual free fall this past week and analysts say retail prices for bacon, which is made from pork bellies, will likely plummet as well. The futures market for frozen pork bellies was created to ensure adequate supplies of bellies during the summer, when demand for bacon peaks and supplies of slaughter-ready hogs traditionally bottoms out. Dealers typically stockpile pork bellies in freezers during the fall and winter, then thaw them out and slice them into bacon during the late spring and summer. Last year, light hog production resulted in tight supplies of frozen pork bellies for the summer months and futures prices soared last summer above 90 cents a pound, a five-year high. Dealers compensated by packing away lots of pork bellies during last fall and winter. They put so many bellies in cold storage that supplies swelled to nearly 103 million pounds by May 1, more than double the previous year's May 1 figure and the third largest total on record for that date, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` This year they got carried away when they put bellies into storage,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They went from a period of deficit to one of tremendous surplus in one year because they overcompensated for having run out last summer,'' he said. Because of this abundance, the price on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for July delivery of frozen pork bellies has plunged 11 percent already this month, from 56.32 cents a pound on May 31 to 50.07 cents on Friday. Analysts said they expected the decline to continue until prices fall low enough to stimulate demand _ possibly as low as 40 cents a pound. And those prices are certain to filter down to the retail level, analysts said. `` They should be able to offer relatively attractive bacon prices this summer,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durccholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. In addition to the large supplies of frozen pork bellies, the market faces good supplies of higher-quality fresh bellies caused by an unseasonably high number of hog slaughters, analysts said. Packers have not cut down on kills because low cash prices for pork products have narrowed their profit margins, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Durccholz </PERSON> said some hog producers, faced with rising feed costs due to the spring drought, may be partially liquidating their herds, thus adding to the number of animals available for slaughter. <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> said frozen pork belly futures prices may rebound briefly before sliding lower. `` Technically, the bellies have definitely got to be oversold at this point,'' he said. `` It's low enough that at some point soon, you've got to get people saying ` Hey, this is overdone,' and going in and buying it.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Hails `Summer Rally'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the calendar says it's still springtime, <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> is talking up what it bills as a `` summer rally'' that began at the end of May in the stock market. After drifting downward on shrinking volume for several weeks, stocks came to life after the Memorial Day weekend. By this past Friday, many of the leading market indicators had reached or approached new highs for the year _ and since the crash last October. The revival of enthusiasm for stocks has puzzled many observers, who have n't noticed any drastic change in the economic news. Money managers at investing institutions, it appears, have simply decided that economic growth is holding to a pace that is moderate enough to continue without a serious increase in inflationary pressures. `` It certainly looks as though the summer rally I have been writing about is upon us,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, told the firm's clients. In the lush world of Wall Street folklore, few phenomena are as enduring as the summer rally. Never mind the numerous studies that have found that stock prices have no discernible tendency to do any better in the summer than at any other time during the year. Never mind that the very idea almost surely originated as a way to drum up business for brokers in a season when customers' attention often wanders to distractions like vacations, long weekends and baseball games As the past couple of weeks have demonstrated, the phrase is so firmly entrenched that it can be applied to an advance that takes place before the summer has even arrived. By whatever name, the market turned in an upbeat showing in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.41 points to 2,101.71, just a shade below its 1988 closing high of 2,110.08 reached on April 12. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 2.58 to 152.89; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market increased 9.39 to 386.25; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index climbed 8.45 to 309.33. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 204.41 million shares a day, against 216.33 million the week before. `` There are some good things happening for both the economy and the financial markets,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has tightened credit conditions a notch, but not too much. The growth of the money supply should continue to be moderate during the next three months. `` The economy, on the other hand, seems to be responding to changes in Federal Reserve policy or whatever by slowing down. `` This is a good combination since it suggests that there will be enough liquidity to drive the economy and have some left over for the financial markets. Historically that has been positive for stock prices.'' However, he added, `` when we are in the 66th month of an economic recovery, it seems judicious to interpret economic signals quite conservatively.'' A return of the kind of speculative mania that drove stocks to extraordinarily high levels last year is unlikely in the near future, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` The memories of October linger on.'' Indeed, few forecasters these days have their sights set on anything like the market highs set last summer, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average peaked at 2,722.42. A runaway rise back to those levels would be seen by many analysts as scary. A nice little summer rally, on the other hand, would get a warm welcome all around.
