 Fire broke out at a downtown retirement hotel Friday, forcing the evacuation of about 150 residents as flames shot out of the top floor and roof of the six-story building, authorities said. Nine of the elderly occupants of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Hotel were taken to hospitals for treatment of minor symptoms ranging from smoke inhalation to chest pains, said fire Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>. Hotel resident <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>, 60, said he was standing in the lobby shortly before 5 p.m. when he heard a hotel employee shout a warning. `` The desk clerk came running up, yelling ` The building's on fire! The building's on fire!''' `` It was such a small fire,'' said <PERSON> Huffman </PERSON>. `` No one took it seriously until we saw the smoke. Now here we are, out on the street.'' The blaze broke out during the commuter rush hour, drawing a large crowd of spectators and snarling traffic. Hotel residents were among the onlookers, some sitting in wooden chairs across the street from the burning building. More than 75 firefighters were called to the scene and several city blocks were cordoned off. They remained closed at 7 p.m. as firefighters mopped up the blaze, which was confined to the sixth floor. `` We do n't have anything on cause or point of origin yet,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. He estimated 150 people were evacuated, including two people who were rescued from the top floor by an aerial-platform atop a firetruck ladder. `` Structurally, the building is sound,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said. `` A wing of the sixth floor was gutted,'' <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said, but firefighters hoped residents of unaffected floors might return home later Friday night, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials were arranging hotel rooms for those who needed them.

 Share prices surged Saturday on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for the fifth straight day of gains and a closing level that topped 28,000 points for the first time since mid-July.

The Nikkei index, the most widely followed market barometer, briefly hovered above 28,000 points in early trading Friday.

<HEAD>Paris Swings To Them Ole' Bedouin Blues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is swinging to those old Bedouin blues. Songs that once were chanted by Algerian shepherds to their sheep are now drawing flocks of hip Parisians to dance in city clubs. The music is called `` rai.'' Pronounced `` rye,'' like the bread, it is the latest sound rocking on French radio, a hard-driving electrified wail that makes it hard to stay still. By fall, the pulsing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> pop likely will be rolling from radios across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as record companies, already cashing in on the worldwide popularity of ethno-new wave, begin promoting the music of northwestern <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Bedouin sheep herders were the first to sing rai, punctuating langorous melodies and improvised lyrics on Algerian angst with the refrain `` ya rai, ya rai'' _ the nomad equivalent of `` oh yeah.'' During World War II, the music shifted from fields around the western town of <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> to bars and brothels in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, where rai singers borrowed American jazz riffs learned from black soldiers, just as they had taken Flamenco passion and the paso doble from Spanish settlers in <LOCATION> Oran </LOCATION> decades before. In 1981, an Algerian record producer realized it was cheaper to synthesize drums than pay a drummer. Adding the drum machine was the birth of rai pop, traditional minor-keyed melodies with a rock n' roll beat. Big hits followed, like `` Ana Ma H'lali Ennoum'' -LRB- `` Personally, I Do n't Appreciate Sleeping Anymore'' -RRB- and `` N'sel Fik'' -LRB- `` You Belong to Me'' -RRB-. Who cares if the Arabic slang belted out by the young rai stars is incomprehensible to the average Parisian? The melodies are haunting and the driving 4-4 beat swings. `` <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> is not poetry,'' <PERSON> Cheb </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, the charismatic <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> of Arab funk told the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, which has two reporters writing exclusively about Arab culture. `` <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> speaks directly to people about what is happening in their lives. The things I sing about, I have lived,'' said <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s new album, `` Kutche,'' was released June 7 in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It is the first top-quality, high-tech rai disk produced by a Western record company, <ORGANIZATION> EMI-Pathe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marconi </ORGANIZATION>, based here. In August three other rai albums by a major British record company are scheduled for release in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including one by <PERSON> Chaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadela </PERSON>, a female vocalist with a rough, sensual voice who has sung duets with <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>. The three disks will be marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. All have attracted the attention of American disk jockeys, said <PERSON> Jumbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Renen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mango </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a division of <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Renen </PERSON> first heard rai in obscure <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> clubs four years ago. He was fascinated by the freshness of the sound and saw its commercial potential. `` There is a growing interest in global excellence and language is no longer a barrier,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Renen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> is part of the new trend toward world music, it is a sound that, in the tired world of rock' n roll, is good and new.'' <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> is the latest trend in the globalization of pop. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s Grammy-winning `` Graceland'' owed much of its uniqueness to the a capella South African male choir Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which opened singer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>' sold-out <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> gig in June. Musicians from <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> are finding new fans around the world. A festival in 1986 that marked the debut of a several rai singers in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> attracted 5,000 people a day during the three days of concerts. The music quickly began attracting audiences of non-North Africans, the target market for <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s new release. `` Kutche'' takes its name from the Algerian version of the Spanish word for car, `` coche,'' reflecting the multi-cultural roots of the music. The record's instrumentation is a cultural melange as well. <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s mellifluous, passionate voice pours over synthizers, accordions, violins, traditional North African flutes, Algerian bendirs -LRB- tamborines -RRB-, Arabic derboukas -LRB- drums -RRB- and several African percussion instruments. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meissonier </PERSON>, who produced <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>'s album, launched Nigerian bandleader King Sunny Ade and is credited with introducing African music to the developed world. He called rai lyrics apolitical. But Algerian authorities banned rai from the radio until three years ago, saying lewd lyrics on wine, women and life in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s fast lane had no place on Moslem airwaves. They since have changed their minds and see the music as a way to reach the young. `` Rai touches people because it is more than simply music,'' <PERSON> Meissonier </PERSON> said. `` Like reggae, it is an attitude. <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> is a way of life.''

<TEXT>
 Presidential athletics often makes people think of touch football in the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> invented a sport that makes those games look like tea parties, say devotees of `` Hoover-ball.'' `` Hoover-ball is not a sport for wimps,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sailor </PERSON>, who is organizing the 1988 Hoover-Ball National Championship Aug. 7 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s birthplace. `` Hoover-ball'' is like volleyball played with a six-pound medicine ball, except players must catch the ball and heave it back over the eight-foot net. The hardest play may be serving, from 33 feet away, or receiving serve, where the ball comes crashing down faster than the stock market in October 1929. `` One of the reasons for the tournament is that <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> has had a bad reputation in history. People think of the Depression when his name is mentioned,'' said Sailor, part-time special events coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and Museum here. `` We want to show there is more to <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, we want to show a more personal side,'' he said. A medicine ball is constructed with a bag of sand at its core, which is wrapped in cotton matting and covered by leather. Used primarily by boxers, whose trainers bash them in the stomach with it while they do situps, the ball is heavy and difficult to catch when it comes flying down. When <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, the nation's 31st president, took office in 1929, he carried a portly 210 pounds on a 5-foot-11-inch frame. His physician, Admiral <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, was concerned and advised excercise. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president strung up a net on the south lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and ordered Cabinet members and other dignitaries to divide into two teams. Except for Sundays, <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members and <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices played the game every day _ national holidays included _ from 7 a.m. to 7:30 a.m., regardless of weather. Teams of two to four players must catch the ball on the fly and return it without passing. A point is won when the opposing team fails to catch the ball or throws it out of bounds. `` It required less skill than tennis, was faster and more vigorous, and therefore gave more exercise in a short time,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> wrote in his memoirs. `` Stopping a six-pound ball with steam back of it, returning it with similar steam, is not pink-tea stuff.'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> lost 25 pounds playing the game. But, like his hopes for a second term, the game faded away. Sailor and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> are reviving it, however, with the tournament held in observance of <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>'s birth in 1874. Sailor said two teams from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, including a writer from Sports Illustrated, will participate, as will about a dozen other rag-tag squads.

<HEAD>Union Files Suit to Block Eastern Cutbacks in Service, Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union representing 12,000 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees seeks to block the carrier from eliminating service in 14 cities in a lawsuit that contends the cutbacks will eventually destroy the company. The suit requests a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order against the cutbacks in service, scheduled to take effect Aug. 31. Eastern announced the changes, along with a work force reduction of 4,000, last Friday. Unless the cutbacks are blocked, the suit says, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will `` embark on a program that will significantly increase its recurring losses and lead to the ultimate destruction of the carrier.'' The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> filed the suit Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The union represents Eastern mechanics and ground workers. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the Machinists local in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the union will argue that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reduction in service benefits <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Both companies are subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` This is an act of self-help,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It's not too different from a lockout, quite frankly.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the airline has `` taken these actions because they're in the best interests of the company, and we expect that the court will agree with us.'' Eastern's cutbacks mean an 11.4 percent reduction in daily flights. The financially struggling company said the move would permit it to concentrate on serving cities where it is strongest.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experts are using computer graphics to explore in three dimensions the revolutionary artistic and scientific work of Italian Renaissance genius <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>. The results will be shown in the Hayward Gallery Jan. 26-April 16, said <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cass </PERSON>, an organizer of the exhibition. `` If <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> was around today there is no doubt he would be using computers and what we are doing is to show that there was no division in his mind between his science and his art,'' Miss <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> said Thursday. She said the exhibition will combine the artistic and scientific interests of da <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> and display the greatest range of his drawings ever assembled. `` Unlike photography, which records surface patterns of light and color, computer graphics build realistic, three-dimensional images,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON>, who is directing the sequences. `` Leonardo's drawings are being plotted into a computer and the sequences will make clear to visitors the spatial thinking and development in his ideas on architectural projects, light in space and geometrical bodies,'' he said. Participants will use the technique to analyze the perspective of <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>'s wall painting `` The Last Supper.'' The painting of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, portrayed at the moment when he tells his disciples that one of them will betray him, marks a turning point in art. It presents questions on perspective that art historians and scientists still have not completely solved since the work was completed in 1497. `` Everything comes together in only one spot, but that varies from different viewpoints and from some positions there appear to be different vanishing points,'' Miss <PERSON> Cass </PERSON> said.

In his `` Treatise on Painting'' <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> wrote: `` Painting encompasses the surfaces, colors, and forms of anything created by nature, and philosophy penetrates those same bodies, considering their properties, but is not satisfied with the truth as shown by the painter.'' <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> said: `` It is striking how many of <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>'s remarks in his treatise, whether on human anatomy, optics or the structure of plants, go well beyond the limits of what is strictly relevant to the painter's needs, and how often a section ends with a remark that he will pursue the subject elsewhere in one of his projected scientific works.'' The exhibition will have 119 drawings, 88 of them from the royal collection at <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION>, and Italian and British models built recently from <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>'s drawings of mechanical inventions. They include a construction of his flying machine with a 36-foot wingspan, ball bearings, a tank and a multibarreled gun. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON>, who lived from 1452 to 1519, worked for <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodovico </PERSON> <PERSON> Sforza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. He entered the duke's service after writing a celebrated letter saying he believed he could give `` complete satisfaction'' in military engineering, constructing buildings and sculpture in marble, bronze or clay. `` In painting I can do as much as anyone, whoever he may be,'' he wrote.

 Chicago-area newlyweds who surfaced here after dropping out of sight for nearly four months said Thursday they understand why a lot of people are upset with them but are thankful their relatives are forgiving. `` What can you say? We're prodigal children,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, referring to the Biblical parable of a wayward youngster who returns to his family in repentance and is welcomed back. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> and his bride, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 22, were reunited Wednesday with her parents, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The elder MacLeans flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> after receiving a letter from the couple Tuesday and talking to them by telephone later that night. `` We did n't come out thinking we would be welcomed with open arms -LRB- but -RRB- that's what happened with our families and that's the most important thing,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` We came out really thinking that we were going to be scorned for the rest of our lives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Swansons </ORGANIZATION>, students at <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in a suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, disappeared April 2 without a word to relatives or friends. The vanishing act led to fears the couple met with foul play. It provoked a massive and costly police investigation and search that principally involved <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police but also included law enforcements agencies from other states. The couple said Thursday they do n't believe they should have to make restitution for the police expenditures. `` It seems fairly unrealistic for them to try to prosecute us in the sense that they want the money back,'' said <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>. He said he believes it's the police rank-and-file, rather than department officials, who want to see some kind of payment because they feel `` really gypped.'' `` It's like ` Here are some yuppie kids from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. They just took off and we have no clues and we did n't know what to do.' And they look silly, so they might want to retaliate,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` Nobody cares, it's over with,'' said an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s missing persons bureau who would not give his name. The couple said they intend to remain in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and pursue their education. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he will pursue his goal of going into the military reserve and wants to teach, while his wife said she plans to write books. The <ORGANIZATION> Swansons </ORGANIZATION>, who eloped in late March, said their love for each other grew while they toiled at jobs at separate delicatessens in the upscale beachfront community of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The two have been in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> since shortly after their disappearance. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said Wednesday night that they came here because they `` did n't know anyone, and no one knew us. It has a climate that is conducive to living outdoors if we needed to bum it for a while.''

 A state college president resigned Thursday after his use of trust funds for personal expenses came under scrutiny and criticism. `` I can no longer offer the leadership which the college requires and deserves, as a result of the intense publicity that has come about in the wake of charges of inaccuracy in the expenditures of general trust funds,'' <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON> said in a letter. College trustees accepted the resignation unanimously after a nearly three-hour private session, which <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON> did not attend. Trustees Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said there was no settlement negotiated with <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>, who had been paid $ 77,000 a year. `` Effective today, he is no longer a member of the faculty and will receive no benefits except for any accrued vacation time,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said. `` It's sufficient to say that in a light most favorable to the president, this could be viewed as careless attention to detail, poor record keeping and mistakes in judgment relative to the use of trust funds, which this board finds unacceptable,'' he said. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said the board would have no specific comment on the results of its investigation into <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>'s expense accounts until after submitting reports on the findings to the <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney and a legislative subcommittee investigating the use of state college trust funds. The <ORGANIZATION> Union-News </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON> billed college trust funds for $ 3,400 in expenses by submitting allegedly inaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners. He later paid back $ 1,259. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> said the trustees will appoint an interim chief executive officer within a week. In the meantime, the board and the four college vice presidents will run the 3,000-student institution, he said. <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON>, 57, has been under fire for his use of college trust funds for personal expenses and waiving entrance requirements for his 16-year-old daughter. She attended the college and lived in a dormitory during the fall semester last year, although she had not graduated from high school. In January, <PERSON> Buchen </PERSON> apologized to trustees and withdrew her from classes. <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON> had succeeded <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilecki </PERSON>, who left amid charges of sexual misconduct with male students and a furor over a $ 10,000 payment by trustees to one of the students. The 150-year-old college, founded by <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, was one of the first coeducational public teachers colleges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 As sand trickled through an hourglass on <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s desk, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> admitted to `` Tonight Show'' viewers that his comically savaged speech at the Democratic convention did not go as planned. `` My sole goal was achieved, however. I wanted so badly to make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> look great, and I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, to the laughter and applause of the show's studio audience. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> delivered the nominating speech for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at last week's Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Allotted 15 minutes, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> spoke for 32 minutes, ignoring flashing red lights and other attempts to cut him off. Finally, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s line `` I want to say, in closing'' drew applause. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> told the audience in his monologue that <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> was to be a guest, and added: `` Not to worry we have plenty of black coffee and extra cots in the lobby.'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> with a satirical, long-winded speech of his own that included details ranging from the governor's educational background After <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> sat on the couch, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, `` My first question is, how are you?'' then turned over the hourglass. The governor said that while his speech was ridiculed, his constituents continued to support him. He said the speech was a `` good idea that did n't work.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> tried a different approach to win over <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s audience, playing a tenor saxophone with the show's orchestra <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s appearance on the <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> show was his latest attempt to use humor to keep the disastrous speech from ruining his image as a rising star in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The governor, who previously had a reputation as a good orator, began polishing his quips in Little Rock shortly after the convention speech was over: `` It was n't my finest hour,'' went one line. `` It was n't even my finest hour and one-half.'' During a speech this week to about 150 educators, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> had trouble with his microphone. Without skipping a beat, he said, `` Have the networks taken control of the mikes?'' On Wednesday at the Capitol, <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> activist and restaurateur <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Say'' <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> dished up food for anyone willing to dish out criticism for the <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> bashers. Diners earned a free meal with lines such as: `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> may be a blabbermouth, but he's the best thing to happen to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.'' `` I appreciate my governor even if he is boring.'' On Thursday, the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat carried <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> in its editorial page comic strip `` Spanks.'' The first frame shows <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> introducing <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> with, `` Now here's a man who was a miniseries unto himself _ `` Gone with the windbag'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' TALK of the town _ Governor <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> appears in the second frame in the image of comedian <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> saying, `` Hey, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON>, I tell yuh, I do n't get no respect.'' The last frame shows <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> finishing his monologue, `` When I was speaking at the convention, one delegate accidentally hit another delegate with his sign. `` Oh excuse me!'' said the first delegate. `` I hit you with my sign.'' `` Hit me again,'' said the second delegate. `` I can still hear him.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>, on its op-ed page, carried a 13-paragraph story by a retired newspaper editor who urged <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> not to let TV people get under his skin. `` If they were all as smart as they sometimes pretend to be, surely some of them would be out there where the really big money is _ selling red neckties to the people who are on television,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruniski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, first elected governor in 1978 at the age of 32, met <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> while serving as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> last year and eventually landed a major role in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign as an adviser and sometime stand-in <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who at one time flirted with the idea of running for president, was among those talked of as a possible <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has a winning record in helping Americans in trouble abroad, but he failed to get the support of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates for a private bid to spring the nine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. So <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is backing off, saying `` no meeting has been set and no meeting has been sought'' for him to negotiate with Iranian officials. The best chance for the hostages remains recognition by <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that their confinement by pro-Iranian factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a humanitarian issue and not a card to play in foreign policy maneuvers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was quoted as saying on Wednesday that he was trying to reach the Iranian foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, through `` third parties'' including Arab diplomats. `` I have continuously expressed my interest in doing whatever I could to make a humanitarian appeal to gain release of the Americans held hostage,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Humanitarian appeals always help. They penetrate deeper than political tradeoffs.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had made the freeing of the hostages a theme in his unsuccessful pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination. Like a number of his proposals, it has a sweet and simple ring to it. In January 1984, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> negotiated the release of Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airman who had been shot down by Syrian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It was widely seen as an attempt by President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, whose government is listed by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a supporter of terrorism, to boost <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s political stock. In June 1984, possibly with similar intentions, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> worked out arrangements with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> for the release of 48 American and Cuban political prisoners. Despite this winning record, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was publicly discouraged by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from trying his hand at personal diplomacy in behalf of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s sentiments concerning the hostages are those shared by all Americans,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Thursday. `` But as for efforts to release the hostages, we believe that official channels offer the best chance of success.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he meant working through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, deputy issues director in the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also voiced qualified disapproval. `` We do not know any of the facts about this matter. As a matter of general policy, Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said that he does not favor private citizens independently conducting foreign policy.'' <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic candidate's wife, said her husband would not sanction any attempt by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to negotiate for the hostages' release. `` My husband feels very strongly that individuals ca n't negotiate, but governments negotiate with each other,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And he would discourage <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from going to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and trying to do that.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will receive the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, was more critical of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s personal diplomacy. `` It should n't happen,'' he said. `` We're talking about very sensitive foreign policy. The administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't need any loose cannons rolling around the deck.'' The remark stung. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday for describing him as a `` loose cannon.'' But he also appeared to back away from the idea of interceding with the Iranians. `` No meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've simply talked through -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Secretary-General -LRB- <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who did meet with the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> foreign minister.'' Traditionally, private citizens are discouraged from conducting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. There is even a law against it. In the case of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the situation is particularly delicate. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was embarrassed when it tried to gain freedom for the hostages by secretly selling missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which did not support the fiasco, is engaged in a careful campaign of messages and public statements designed to draw <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> into a direct discussion of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, the hostages and terrorism. So far, there has been no `` authorized'' response from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` They know where to get hold of us,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. An offer on Tuesday by <PERSON> Hojatolislam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the speaker of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament, to help obtain the release of the American captives if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> returned frozen assets was turned down. `` No deals,'' <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, promptly retorted. If <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agrees to talk with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the hostages will be high on the agenda. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration does not want to appear to be making another deal with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. In the meantime, it is seeking release of the hostages through a separate diplomatic track. When it comes to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and to the hostages, a badly burned <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration prefers proceeding with extreme caution.

 Six Israelis on the first diplomatic mission to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> broke diplomatic relations with the Jewish state in 1967 say they want to review procedures for Soviet Jews who want to leave. The Israeli diplomats planned to pray in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s central synagogue on the Jewish Sabbath, which begins this evening. Officially, the Israelis came Thursday to inspect the embassy building on <LOCATION> Bolshaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ordynka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been paying the Soviets $ 100,000 a year to rent the building and diplomats from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> have been taking care of it. But the focus of the Israelis' visit is another role the Dutch have been performing for the Israeli government _ the processing of requests by Soviet Jews for Israeli visas. <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, head of the delegation and a counselor at his country's embassy in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said his group might meet with prominent Jewish refuseniks who have been denied permission by Soviet authorities to leave the country. From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated, but only a small fraction went to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Last year, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> allowed 8,011 Jews to emigrate. Four of the diplomats were born in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> left in 1957 at the age of 10. `` I think you have an expression _ butterflies in the stomach,'' he said at Sheremetyevo airport after the group arrived from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. `` The ones I have in my stomach are very big.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he hopes the visit is `` the first step in developing the process of improving relations between the states of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' But Kremlin officials stress that the visit is not a precursor to the restoration of diplomatic relations, broken off after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized lands from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> during the 1967 Middle East War. The Soviet visas the delegation received in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> entitle them to a two-month stay in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says it wo n't restore relations until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws from the occupied territories and agrees to an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> allow its representatives to visit in exchange for permission for a Soviet consular delegation to visit the Jewish state. Eight Soviet diplomats have been in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since last July to survey Russian Orthodox Church property and meet with Soviet citizens living there.

<HEAD>Witness: North Wanted to Give Anti-Drug Money to Contras Instead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug enforcement official says former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffer <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> suggested in 1984 that $ 1.5 million designated for a drug sting operation be diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras instead. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON>, now in charge of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> rejected the idea. <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said he told North the suggestion would have compromised the chief operative in one of the agency's most significant undercover operations. As it turned out, according to <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> witnesses, the investigation was compromised anyway _ and closed prematurely _ several weeks later when details were leaked to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. The hearing was the first in a series by the Judiciary subcommittee on crime, which is trying to learn whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials condoned drug smuggling and other criminal activities to further its Central American policy _ especially winning aid for the Contra rebels. Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the panel has `` discovered many, many instances of persons in or associated with ... elements of our government attempting to convert, to divert, and to subvert the criminal justice process.'' North, who has been indicted in the separate diversionof millions of dollars from the administration's <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras, figured prominently in Thursday's testimony. The testimony focused on a 1984 sting operation, in which <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> used convicted drug pilot <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> to make contact with the Colombian cocaine cartel _ then operating in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ and a purported Nicaraguan government official, <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> later said the committee has doubts about whether <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> was in fact part of the government. Nonetheless, four DEA witnesses said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was interested in exposing an alleged involvement of the marxist Nicaraguan government in drug smuggling, so the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could win an upcoming congressional vote on Contra aid. <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON>, who was in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> cocaine desk in 1984, said he briefed North on the undercover operation in late June or early July 1984, after <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> had brought cocaine back from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Seal at the time was functioning as a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> operative, hoping his cooperation would bring him a lenient sentence. <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said he told North that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> planned to send Seal back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to make a $ 1.5 million payment for the drugs he brought back, with the money to be split between the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> drug kingpins in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and Nicaraguan officials. `` Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> asked why we could n't land the plane outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and turn the money over to the Contras,'' <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> official said he responded that such a plan would jeopardize Seal, who had won the trust of the Colombian drug cartel and of <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, identified by the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> witnesses as an official of the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the hearing centered on the news leak to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, which published its story on the Seal operation July 17, 1984. Seal then became a government witness rather than an operative, but was machine-gunned to death in early 1986 after declining federal protection. <PERSON> Caffrey </PERSON> said when he briefed North on the operation before the story was leaked, the then-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer `` asked when the operation could go public.'' He added that <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` did indicate to me there was a vote coming up on an appropriation bill to aid the Contras. I told him public disclosure would come from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney or the attorney general ... but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation'' and did not want to compromise it. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent who directed Seal, said that following the leak, `` I heard from my superiors the leak came from an aide in the White House.'' Still an undercover agent, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> testified from behind a screen. A former top <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> official, ex-assistant administrator <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON>, testified, `` I thought the leak came from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> because of the Contra vote that was coming up.'' <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON> told the subcommittee that the day the news story appeared, an irate <PERSON> North </PERSON> called him to deny that he was responsible for the leak. North, he said, accused the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> of telling a reporter that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the source of the information. `` He called to say he did not leak the information and the proof was the facts -LRB- in the story -RRB- were not accurate,'' <PERSON> Monastero </PERSON> said. `` My response was, ` That's the standard way to cover your tracks.' I did n't accept that.'' Pages from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s diary, released by the subcommittee, show the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffer made frequent references to the drug operation in the weeks before the leak. And the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a Nicaraguan airstrip. <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said that shortly before the leak, a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> told him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news media to suggest Sandinista involvement in drug smuggling.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Air Controllers' Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has upheld a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration program of drug testing for air traffic controllers, saying they `` have the lives of thousands of people in their hands.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON>'s ruling was the first in favor of a drug testing program by a judge in the federal court here, where labor groups have filed most of their suits attacking the administration's plans for urine testing of federal employees. An appeal of the ruling is expected. Another federal judge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has struck down a testing program for all federal prison workers, and the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which covers <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and eight other Western states, has ruled against mandatory testing of railroad crews after accidents and rule violations. The latter decision has been accepted for review by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> announced his ruling July 19 but has not yet issued it in written form. A transcript of his comments was made available to reporters Thursday. The lawsuit, like those against other drug programs, contended random drug testing is unconstitutional because it is not based on individual suspicion of impairment from current drug use. The suit also argued that drug testing was unreliable and would be ineffective in promoting safety. The judge said he was unimpressed by statistics showing that less than 1 percent of air traffic controllers had shown signs of drug use in testing so far. `` We are talking here about air traffic controllers who have the lives of thousands of people in their hands,'' <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> said. In response to arguments that drug testing does n't show whether an employee is currently impaired or under the influence, <PERSON> Vukasin </PERSON> said, `` Unfortunately, the state of the art has not reached that level. But that is not an argument of why what at least is available to the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should not be exercised and utilized.'' Apparently referring to the ruling on railroad workers, he said he `` may be failing to follow precedents, but if so, it is not done out of disrespect.''

 No major adjustments because of this year's drought are in the works for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 wheat acreage program Winter wheat producers soon will be planting next year's crop, and the no-change announcement Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> helps clear the way. All they need now is rain. As it stands now, wheat farmers will have to idle 10 percent of their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price supports, the same as announced last spring. The 10 percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on May 25, under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the following year's crop prior to June 1. That was before the drought became so widespread and severe. `` Even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production, especially that of spring wheat, the prospective supply-demand balance -LRB- for the coming year -RRB- does not call for a change in the previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, who was out of town, said in a statement. A crop projection issued on July 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at 1.84 billion bushels, down from 2.12 billion bushels forecast in June. The 1987 harvest was about 2.1 billion bushels. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat inventories have been large, despite a heavy export drain, and totaled around 1.27 billion bushels on June 1, the beginning of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year. The smaller harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to around 666 million bushels by June 1, 1989, according to the projections. Earlier, the June 1, 1989, wheat carryover was forecast at 781 million bushels. Winter wheat, which comprises about three-fourths of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total, will be planted this fall for harvest next year. Spring wheat, including durum used for pasta, is produced farther north and bore the brunt of this summer's drought damage to the wheat crop. In a related development, officials served notice that wheat export subsidies are continuing, despite the drought and reduction in wheat supplies. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by two companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons, and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the sales were part of an authorized 2 million tons of wheat announced April 5 under the Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, and some left over from an earlier authorization. Although no selling prices or other details were announced, recent wheat prices at farm points have averaged around $ 3.46 per bushel, indicating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm value of about $ 50 million. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. Prior to the new authorization on April 5, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had bought 4.9 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidy arrangements. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has 610,000 tons still available for use. Under the program, exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the bonuses due the four companies averaged $ 9.84 per ton of wheat, or about 27 cents a bushel. The bonuses will be paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>

 Drought may be gnawing at the bank accounts of many farmers, but the hot, dry weather is n't expected to cut back on their spending for many production items this year, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` The drought is expected to have little impact on 1988 expenditures for seed, fertilizer and pesticides because most of these ... were applied at or before planting,'' the report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Farm machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in 1988 but could be slowed by the drought.'' Spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be affected significantly by the drought, however. `` Energy expenditures for irrigation will be up, but likely will be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and drying,'' the report said, a grim reminder that reduced yields _ or none at all _ mean it will cost less to run grain combines and dryers. Spending on farm machinery increased $ 1.2 billion to $ 5.8 billion in 1987, ending seven years of decline, the report said. Net cash income of farmers _ the difference between gross cash receipts and cash expenses _ rose to a record $ 56 billion in calendar 1987. Current <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts put 1988 net cash income at $ 53 billion to $ 59 billion.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is putting the finishing touches on an emergency aid package for thousands of migrant workers stranded in the drought-parched <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, a department spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Zachariasiewicz </PERSON> said Thursday the agency `` has a plan of action'' but it wo n't be unveiled until Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who is overseas, gives it her final approval. An announcement is likely next week. A source said the package would total $ 4 million to $ 5 million but `` the final distribution is just not set on paper yet.'' The package follows appeals by Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, for assistance to migrant and seasonal workers who were unable to earn a living this summer because of the drought. In his letter to Mrs. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> said: `` Migrant workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested their personal savings to search for field work. Drought conditions have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their financial losses. `` Because the president's emergency relief program is directed solely at the farmer level, migrant workers and their families have no safety net to relieve their conditions. Measures taken to date have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks.'' <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and grandson of Mexican-Americans who followed the crops, said he still has relatives who travel from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to harvest sugar beets. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> estimates the stranded migrant and seasonal worker population at about 10,000, but said it is difficult to get a true figure because `` they do n't have a high profile. ... They're not a voting bloc like some others that make a lot of noise.'' `` Exhausted of their personal financial resources, they have no money for temporary shelter and food,'' he wrote. `` Many would like to return home, but they can not. They are broke, indebted, stranded and dependent on the kindness and charity of local efforts.'' He said he is seeking funds to provide shelter, food and job-search assistance to migrants who want to stay in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to help farmers salvage crops, and to give others who want to return home money for travel. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> also sent his appeal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Senators are using the closing weeks of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put the issue of global warming from the `` greenhouse effect'' at the top of their environmental agenda for next year. They got the ball rolling this week with the introduction of legislation prompted by a series of hearings over the last two years at which scientists warned that the greenhouse effect threatens the planet with higher temperatures, climate changes and rising oceans in the next century. Sixteen senators, including <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., unveiled a comprehensive plan on Thursday that calls for a variety of steps, from developing safer nuclear power to slowing the destruction of forests in the Third World A day earlier, a group headed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., submitted a package to end <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals that contribute to global warming and destroy the Earth's vital ozone <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who has been identified more with energy development and production than environmental protection, said he would hold a series of hearings in coming weeks to set the stage for 1989. Next year, he said at a news conference, `` we'll have to begin the serious process of legislating. We'll act as fast as the public's willing to support us.'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> is a cosponsor of most elements in a package developed by Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., that represents the broadest <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> response yet to the greenhouse warnings `` The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic, political, environmental and human problem facing the 21st Century,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect, said: `` The evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable. It is so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing than anything we've ever seen.'' Aides said <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> has become convinced that global action is necessary to combat the production of carbon and other gases that scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> stopped short of endorsing a key element of <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>'s proposal: reducing carbon monoxide emissions by requiring new car fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, a doubling of the 1985 fuel efficiency standard The <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> package would force this country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate that carbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, produces about half the world's greenhouse gases. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is said to be responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. The proposal would require administration officials to draft a national energy plan emphasizing the least expensive ways to reduce fossil fuel use and increase use of renewables such as solar energy. The package would authorize about $ 1 billion through 1992 for research and development of non-fossil energy sources and a new generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls for greater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating and transportation. On the international front, the secretary of state would be urged to hold a meeting aimed at getting other nations to commit to a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production by 2015. The legislation also would authorize this country to spend more than $ 1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in burgeoning nations. It also calls for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to work through international lending and development agencies to slow the destruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive but which emit huge amounts when they are cut down. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said that to slow down polluting development in the Third World, `` we're going to have to pay for their non-development in some way, and it's going to be expensive.'' Joining as cosponsors were <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont.; <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, D-N.M.; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo.; Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>; <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt.

<TEXT>
 A 66-million-year-old rock deposit in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> creek bed shows that the area was once smashed by a massive ocean wave, perhaps triggered by a large comet or asteroid that hit the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, according to a study published today in the journal Science. <PERSON> Thor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a geologist at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he and another researcher found evidence that a wave, perhaps as tall as 300 feet, scoured the floor of a primitive <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, picked up sand and shark teeth, then dumped the material in what now is in a bed of a tributary to the <LOCATION> Brazos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It -LRB- the wave -RRB- was so big, we think the circumstantial evidence is very strong that it was caused by a bolide -LRB- meteorite -RRB- impact,'' said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. The deposit, he said, was found in what is called the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This is the name given a geologic formation that other researchers have identified as having been created during a time that meteorites were showering Earth, about 66 million years ago. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the formation he found in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> creek bed is rich in iridium, an element that is common in meteorites but rare on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It is considered a universal mark of the Cretaceous-Tertiary -LRB- called K-T -RRB- boundary. At the time that the wave was created, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the whole Gulf coast area looked far different than now. The waters of the ocean were much higher and the coast was much farther inland. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the massive wave churned against the ocean floor, moving huge clay boulders, picking up sand, limestone and shark teeth, and leaving a path of great erosion. When the waters settled down, the debris was deposited again on the ocean floor, leaving a mark of the violence that occurred. Over many centuries, the sea water receded, dry land emerged and now the deposit left by the wave is seen in the wall of a creek bed in <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The thing that is remarkable about this deposit is that it was produced far offshore on a quiet water shelf,'' said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. `` Above and below is just mud, quiet water sedimentation. There's no evidence of any disturbance at all Yet, in the middle of that, there is this quite large unit.'' Based on the force required to move the material left in the deposit, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said he calculated that the wave had to be 150 to 300 feet high. Circumstantial evidence, he said, leads to the theory that a meteorite striking the ocean caused the wave because there is no geologic evidence suggesting that a volcano or an earthquake could have triggered the wave. `` There was no volcanic activity nearby at the time,'' he said. `` Also, we find no volcanic ash in the formation.'' The only other thing that could have created such a large wave of this type, said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, is a meteorite about six miles in diameter that probably struck the west central <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Other researchers, he said, have found K-T formations in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and offshore from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. All of these, said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, help support the idea that a boulder from space swamped <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with a splash some 66 million years ago. Co-investigators with <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> in the study were <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgeois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Researchers Find AIDS Disrupts Key Immune Response In Cell</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have long known that the AIDS virus can kill the disease-fighting T-cells in the body, but research published today shows that the virus can also destroy the immune system simply by disrupting the inner mechanism of these cells. In a study published today in Science, a group of researchers said they have found that the AIDS virus is able to block a function of a key molecule in T-cells and prevent the immune response from taking place. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartzman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said he and his co-researchers made the finding by comparing the response of T-cells that were infected with the AIDS virus with T-cells that were uninfected. Normally, T-cells respond to an antigen by binding to it and then starting a process that leads to the production of antibodies. Part of this process is a signal by a molecule called the CD3 receptor which is on the outside of the T-cell. This signal crosses the cell wall and triggers production of calcium within the cell. This calcium then leads to the next step in producing an antibody against the disease. <PERSON> Hartzman </PERSON> said the study showed that in T-cells infected with HIV-1, which is an AIDS virus, the ability of the CD3 receptor to release calcium is blocked or retarded. `` This is a mechanism that can disrupt the immune response,'' said <PERSON> Hartzman </PERSON>. `` We knew that HIV can kill T-cells. Now this shows that it can also reduce the qualitative response of those cells.'' The study was conducted using T-cells from healthy donors. Part of the cells were infected with HIV and the rest were not. The cells were cultured for 60 days and then exposed to a antibody that would mimic the early response to an antigen. In the uninfected cells, the CD3 took the normal next step by releasing calcium into the interior of the cell.

 An Irish girl who crossed the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> as a stowaway on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer told a judge Thursday she yearns for her homeland, and her mother said the family might seek legal action against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` I just want to go home,'' 16-year-old <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Morelock </PERSON>. The judge put her in custody of two <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents who were escorting her. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> was put on a flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and left from there at 10:45 p.m. on a flight to <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The girl apparently slipped aboard the USS Conyngham while it was on a courtesy call in <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. She was discovered aboard the guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to its <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, base. Three officers searched the ship after hearing a girl was aboard and found her in a 2 -LCB- - foot-wide, 15-foot-long, 3-foot-high compartment above a refrigeration unit Five sailors accused of helping the girl were being held at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> base, authorities said. If charged and convicted, they face a maximum five years in prison and a fine of $ 2,000 for aiding an illegal entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>'s parents said they are considering suing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` There is a lot more to this than meets the eye,'' said <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had telephoned her in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to apologize. They said her daughter could not have boarded the ship undetected without help from crew members, Mrs. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said. In court Thursday, Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> listened intently as Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the judge she was a runaway and would be considered an undisciplined child under the American court system. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasse </PERSON> said no charges would be filed against Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>. After the hearing, deGrasse approached Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> and gave her a stern lecture. He said her status as a juvenile had protected her, but that she had committed a serious offense. A <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight carrying the girl to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a connecting flight home was diverted to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> on Tuesday when she became sick. She was released Wednesday night from <ORGANIZATION> Rex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor who did not know what the girl was treated for. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had asked Wednesday night about booking the girl on another <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but the airline refused her passage because of possible medical problems.

<HEAD>U.S. Pressing Soviets for Afghan Mine Maps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interagency team is meeting daily in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to plan for what is expected to be one of the largest refugee migrations in this century, the return of exiled Afghans to their homeland. The refugees are expected to include some 3 million in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and another 2.2 million exiled in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. There are also between 1 million and 3 million Afghans still inside their country but who have been displaced by the anti-Soviet guerrilla war. As part of the repatriation planning, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for maps showing the locations of land mines scattered by Soviet troops throughout <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. At the same time, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, in a meeting with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, allayed concerns that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was reneging on its timetable for withdrawing troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` This impression has just been dispelled,'' <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> are comparing notes on how to monitor the Soviet withdrawal _ and on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s future after the troops are gone. One of the immediate problems is the land mines. A team of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts recently visited <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to assess the extent of the mine problem across the border in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said a senior official involved in the refugee repatriation effort. The official asked not to be identified. The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> team recommended that Afghan refugees be taught how to recognize mines so they do not inadvertently step on them, and that some of them be trained to deactivate the explosive devices. `` They have to be trained in mine awareness. They'll have to live with it for decades,'' he said. Some refugees returning to the town of <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION> stepped on mines in recent weeks, and word of the danger spread among the refugee camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say it is difficult to determine just how many mines are strewn around the rugged Afghan countryside because many of the devices were dropped out of helicopters rather than methodically sown. Estimates vary from 5 million to 30 million. `` We're telling them -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- that they're responsible for the devastation, and the least they can do is help with maps,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. The Soviets have said they removed most of the mines and that the remaining ones were planted by the U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting the Soviets. `` That's just false,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Threatens Suit Over Dangers of Play Sand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group says it will sue the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> if it does n't do something about what the group sees as the threat of cancer lurking in children's sand piles. A commission officials said Thursday there is no evidence that commercial play sand causes cancer, but the commission will make a formal decision on a petition to ban limestone products, including play sand, in September. Industry officials say if sand from the nation's rock quarries caused cancer, there would be higher instances of the disease among workers in the centuries-old industry. Public Citizen, a non-profit organization which fights for product safety and public health, said in a news release Thursday that many of the nation's children could be exposed to play sand that contains dangerous asbestos or asbestos-like tremolite fibers. `` During the hot summer of 1988 your children may be playing in the sandbox. Would you want them to be breathing asbestos as they pour buckets of sand over each other?'' the consumer group asked. Asbestos fibers have been proven to cause cancer when inhaled. Children who are exposed to them may not be afflicted until many years after exposure, the group said. In a letter to the product safety commission, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> said that if the agency does not indicate within 30 days that it plans to resolve the issue, the group will consider legal action. Appeals to the safety commission to protect workers and consumers from exposure to rock-based fibers date back 12 years. In May, the agency said it had evaluated several play sand samples and did not find asbestos in any of them. Public Citizen, however, said sand sold under two brand names, Basins Play Sand and Quickrete Kiddie's Fun Sand, have been shown by tests to contain tremolite, a rock-forming mineral that can occur in an asbestos form. `` No one knows how many other brands may be similarly contaminated,'' the group said. An official of Package Pavement of <LOCATION> Stormville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a distributor of Kiddie's Fun Sand, said five outside tests have been conducted on its sand and none found harmful ingredients. `` All indications are that there is no such fiber in our play sand,'' said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, vice president for marketing. She said sand from a quarry in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> does contain tremolite, but in a crystalline form which is not harmful. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberle </PERSON>, safety commission program manager for chemical hazards, said no one has found true asbestos in play sand. She said the fiber-like particles that have raised concern are not tremolite asbestos but ultra-thin cleavages from crystalline tremolite that occur in some marble-based sand. `` It's very upsetting to us because parents get naturally terrified. I've spent a lot of time on the phone telling people this is not asbestos,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Eberle </PERSON> said, however, that the commission is still considering a petition by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> geologist and physician <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Germine </PERSON> to ban all limestone products, including play sand, lawn and garden limestone and consumer gravel products. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Renninger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the industry, said the claim of cancer-causing ingredients in sand is old and is not backed up by the evidence. `` We produce a billion tons of stone a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and we've been doing it for a couple of hundred years,'' he said. `` I think that there'd be evidence of asbestos disease problems in people exposed for their entire working lives, and there simply is n't.'' <PERSON> Renninger </PERSON> said tremolite is among the most common rock-forming minerals and is found in almost every rock product. Public Citizen researcher Dr. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, a pediatrician, accused sand distributors of trying to hide the danger of their products. `` The industry throws up a smokescreen,'' she said in an interview. `` If somebody dies from falling off the left side of a skyscraper, they tell you there's nothing to prove that falling off the right side is also dangerous.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is seasoning his Western campaign with a Democratic version of the Sagebrush Rebellion that helped sweep the Republicans into the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> capitalized on the independent spirit of the West by promising to get government off the backs of the people. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning for the vice presidency as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, sounded a lot like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a speech in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, on Thursday `` If there is one lesson we have learned in recent years, it is that the federal government ca n't solve all of the -LRB- nation's -RRB- problems,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` But,'' he said, trying to make that compatible with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' promise of an activist government, `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can lead. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> promised the convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislators </ORGANIZATION> that a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would not be `` imperial and overbearing.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as a governor, understood that problem and he, as a Texan, understood the West. `` I think what you see in a candidate like myself, one from a state like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which shares a lot of the Western concerns and objectives, is someone who can converse on the problems with an experience and background that has compatibility,'' he told reporters. By putting him on the ticket, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` saying to Democrats who went and voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, come home, there's a place for you in this party.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said, would `` see that Westerners were very much a part of the administration and in highly responsible positions, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, adding that he would push for that also. The Democratic ticket lost all but <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> four years ago. Although no schedule has yet been made, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign plans to use <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as a tool to lure back not only his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but also the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, South and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> began his first solo tour as the vice presidential nominee Wenesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and campaigned on Thursday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> prior to his Reno trip. He planned to visit a child care center in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> today before heading to a rally in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, was on a campaign swing through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The two men made a joint campaign trip immediately following last week's Democratic National Convention with stops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> asked for union support of the ticket at a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> got cheers from the crowed of 3,500 when he cited his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> record including this year's big fight with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration over the trade bill and the sixty-days notice for plant closings. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be able to override the president if he vetoes those bills. Earlier this year, when the two measures were in a single package, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto was sustained.

 Documents disclosing details of the massive <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract fraud inquiry will remain secret, a federal judge ruled Thursday, rejecting bids by news organizations to make the information public. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said they will appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> accepted a government argument that unsealing search warrants and their accompanying affidavits might hinder completion of the wide-ranging fraud investigation. `` The court does not wish to minimize the importance of the role of the press, especially in matters of extreme public interest such as the investigation concerned herein,'' said <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>. `` However, the court finds that, on balance, the public's interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at this time,'' he said The documents in question detail searches conducted June 14 at <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and the home of defense consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. The only segments released by the government were introductions showing that wiretaps had been used. The massive government probe, which became public last month, centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information that helped contractors win multimillion-dollar contracts. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> overruled an earlier decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> who held that the public had a right to know details of such an investigation, which affects operation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge T.F. <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, Thursday also denied a newspaper's request to unseal documents that are part of the investigation. `` There is a right under the First Amendment of access to court documents,'' <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said in denying The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>'s motion that the affidavits used to gain search warrants for <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' offices be unsealed. `` But at this early stage, the right is a qualified and limited one.'' <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> is a subsidiary of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>President Tells Young Evangelicals Abortions `Must Stop'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised a child care proposal by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calling it a means of allowing women to choose to stay home with their children if they want. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a group of evangelical young people Thursday the plan would `` strengthen the family'' because `` the basic idea here is that the government would simply let families keep up to $ 1,000 more of their own money.'' `` That's money the family itself can decide how to spend,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Working mothers could put the money toward child care. But by giving each family this tax credit the vice president's plan would also permit thousands of mothers to choose to stay home with their children.'' It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first comment on the proposal, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is making part of his own presidential campaign. In the speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Evangelism at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Convention Center, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also reiterated his opposition to abortion, saying, `` We can not proclaim the noble ideal that human life is sacred, then turn our backs on the taking of some 4,000 unborn children's lives every day. `` This must stop,'' the president said. `` An abortion is the taking of a human life. `` Many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances,'' he added. `` And just as tolerance means accepting that many in good faith hold views different from our own, it also means that no man or woman should sit in judgment on another. `` I believe - and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes with me - that we must rise above bitterness and reproach to find positive answers to the tragedy of abortion.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his administration has sought to reflect a `` return to basic values'' through such steps as the enactment by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the Equal Access Act of 1984, giving voluntary religious groups the right to meet after school on the same basis as other groups. He also cited longstanding administration positions in support of returning prayer to the classroom and reversing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that legalized abortions. He said legislation his administration has submitted to deal with child pornography is being held up in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and asked, `` If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leadership really care about family values, is n't it time they brought this anti-pornography legislation to a vote?'' He also talked to the young men and women about the pressures teen-agers feel to have sex out of wedlock. `` I'm sure that each of you believes that someday you'll find someone to fall in love with _ and you will,'' he said. `` You know that when you meet that person, and meet in a marriage, that you will be true to each other. Well, did you ever stop to think you can start being true to that one special person beginning now?'' The 8,000 young people cheered wildly, applauded, stamped their feet and jumped up and down as the president made his appearance in the cavernous hall. He opened by leading the group in the pledge of allegiance to the American flag, and ended by joining others in the crowd in waving a small flashlight in an effort to keep time to the music as the group sang a song proclaiming, `` We will carry the torch of the Lord.''

<HEAD>Eight Indicted In Plot To Illegally Divert Libyan Government Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Arraignments are scheduled for next week for six Libyans and two other Arab nationals charged with plotting to use <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> government money to recruit dissident support in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The eight were indicted by a federal grand jury on Thursday, and are scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 5. The 40-count indictment did not make any mention of previous accusations that one of the defendants, <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, took part in a plot to assassinate a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. The target of the alleged plot has been identified as <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who helped plan the 1986 aerial bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> travel agency owner, was charged with asking another defendant, <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennosi </PERSON>, to gather personal information about a high-ranking government official for the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which is an intelligence agency. All eight, who were arrested last week by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> following a yearlong probe, are charged with laundering money and violating the 1986 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> sanctions regulations which prohibit travel to and transactions with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. In a related development, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> ordered two leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> jailed until they agree to testify before the grand jury that is continuing its investigation into the Libyan case. The two, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellecourt </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>, were promised immunity from prosecution but refused to testify in protest over the government's wire tapping of their phones and what they said were other violations of their rights. <PERSON> Bellecourt </PERSON>, of the White Earth Chippewa Nation from northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said he visited <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> several times and was one of the organizers of a 1987 rally in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> marking the first anniversary of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing. The case against the eight Arabs accuses them of violating a special license granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that allows <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to send money for its estimated 250 students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the money, allegedly used it to organize support among American Indians and Black Moslems, including travel to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and anti-American demonstrations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The indictment charges that the <ORGANIZATION> PCLS </ORGANIZATION> was used `` to further revolutionary policy ... by recruiting and funding members of selected American groups and by gathering intelligence information.'' <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>, who is a naturalized American with Jordanian citizenship, allegedly used his Manara travel agency in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to supply false billings and make travel arrangements for the Indians. Seven of the defendants were accused of being Libyan agents masquerading as students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The eighth, <PERSON> Manhal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON>, is a Moroccan employee at <LOCATION> Manara </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hawamda </PERSON>'s brother-in-law The other defendants are: <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Rajhi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Zubeidy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shibani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abousetta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Belgasem </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sennosi </PERSON>. All six Libyans are current or former officers of the PCLS. One of the six, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Rajhi </PERSON>, was accused by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> last week of gathering information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials for use by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in retaliation for the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing. No mention of this was made in the indictment.

<HEAD>Looking For Trouble: Militant Israeli Patrols Stir Emotions In
Jerusalem</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A clenched fist thrust inside a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON> is their insignia, a symbol of their anger and their allegiance. Loaded guns and lengthy arrest records represent their willingness to express both. `` The Arabs are more afraid of us than the police,'' says <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, an immigrant to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` We have a freer hand.'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION>, an innocuous name for a militant group whose armed patrols in Arab sectors of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> have stirred emotions in this divided city. The group is made up of followers of American-born Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> and his Kach movement, which advocates expelling all Arabs from Israeli-controlled territory. They patrol in vans and on foot in defiance of police, who have arrested 20 of the vigilantes in six days. Some officials fear the group will provoke violence between the <LOCATION> Holy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 135,000 Palestinians and 340,000 Jews. `` They are absolutely irresponsible elements and one has to do everything to stop them,'' Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio this week. On one patrol Thursday, four men whose ages range from 16 to 24 drove through <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to the Jewish community of <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> and escorted bus No. 25, often a target of Arab stoning attacks, to the center of the city. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yishai </PERSON>, organizer of the patrols, said many Jews appreciate the efforts of his committee. He was among those detained and warned by police, but he said that if he catches a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> stone-thrower, `` I will break his arm.'' All 20 of those detained were freed on bail of up to $ 3,750 after being charged with incitement, and most are patroling again. On Thursday, the van drove slowly past mosques, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> restaurants, stores and homes in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The four men looked out the windows. A 9mm handgun rested on the dashboard. As it passed three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers eating lunch beneath a tree, 22-year-old <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, shouted: `` We're from Kahane!'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, also one of the men arrested, says the volunteer patrols literally look for trouble. `` We keep our eyes open for some suspicious-looking <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, someone who looks around like a thief in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Then we drive back and forth. If we catch them trying to hurt an Israeli, we rough them up. Sometimes, we put them in the trunk of the car and take them to the police.'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, 24, said the committee has about 100 volunteers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, 80 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and 60 in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, the northern port city. They saw no suspicious Palestinians on Thursday's hour-long patrol, however. `` It's a shame. I wanted to see some action,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s supporters began citizen convoys in March 1987 _ generally in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where most of them live as settlers _ and began patrolling <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> last week. Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 war and has annexed, has become a focal point of the rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Since the uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, more than 230 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed. The road committee's symbol, the fist inside a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>, illustrates its philosophy that Jews must be tough to survive, even in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Supporters of Kach hope the image of a protector of Jews will help in November's election. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> now is its only representative in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament. Like most <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> supporters, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> believe peace with the Arabs is not possible because `` they do n't want it.'' <PERSON> Dayan </PERSON> said he is prepared for violence. `` We were n't put on this Earth to live happily and peacefully,'' he said. `` We were put here to study the Bible and to hold on to our land.''

 A garden snake that startled a one-legged man triggered a series of events that left his car and house in flames. The 3-foot, non-poisonous snake was napping under the front seat of <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s car, but awoke when the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> man climbed behind the wheel Thursday to test the engine he'd been repairing. `` The snake bit me on the ankle,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, 45, who lost his right leg in a hang-gliding accident in 1975. `` I started stomping it and hit the gas, and then the car lunged forward.'' The car accelerated into the rear of <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s house, spilling a can of gas that was open on its bumper and causing flames to shoot out of the open carburetor. The ensuing blaze quickly enveloped the front of <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s car and leaped to his home. `` I was lucky,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The car started again and I backed it away, then got out.'' A passerby notified the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which brought the blaze under control about 30 minutes after it began. While firefighters fought to smother the last of the flames, the snake was still curled inside the front seat of the abandoned car. Next to a fire truck parked in front of his home, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> sat in his wheelchair watching the smoke and shaking his head incredulously. `` I ca n't believe that damn thing's still alive.''

<HEAD>Brazilian Ministers Quit in Constitutional Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Cabinet ministers joined a third colleague and quit in a growing dispute over the nation's proposed constitution, a presidential aide said. Culture Minister <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Furtado </PERSON> and Science and Technology Minister <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrique </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON> handed in their resignations Thursday, said a presidential aide who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he did not know why they had resigned. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> minister, quit Wednesday. The resignations came after President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> on Tuesday attacked the constitution, proposed by lawmakers after 18 months of work, as `` chaotic.'' He said it could make <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> impossible to govern. Despite <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s broadcast, legislators overwhelmingly approved the rough draft of the new constitution late Wednesday. The document includes proposals to limit annual interest rates to 12 percent, to give Brazilians control of all mining operations, to cut the voting age from 18 to 16, and to grant the unrestricted right to strike and a six-hour work day. The three ministers' resignations deepened a split between the president and <ORGANIZATION> Ulysses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION>, the powerful speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and president of the 559-member <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. All three ministers are close personal friends of <LOCATION> Guimaraes </LOCATION>, who responded to <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s criticisms with a sharply-worded defense of the assembly's work. Tuesday's broadcast was <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s last-ditch attempt to remove several proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969 constitution handed down by military generals. The military has raised objections to the constitution. Lawmakers now can amend the document in a second round of voting expected to end in September. Agrarian Reform Minister <PERSON> Jader </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbalho </PERSON> will be the new <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> minister, the presidential spokesman said. Education Minister <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleao </PERSON> will head the Culture Ministry, and the <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> will be headed by <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The fire that destroyed the home of imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was prompted by a dispute between black teen-age groups and was not aimed at <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION> himself, sources said. Police said as many as 50 black high school students stoned the house, doused it with gasoline and set it ablaze Thursday. No one was hurt and no arrests were made, they said. Neighbors and black journalists, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some attackers wore jackets of <PERSON> Daliwonga </PERSON> high school in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and were involved in a dispute Wednesday with young blacks who guard the home. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, a prominent anti-apartheid activist, was bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned of the fire. Her daughter, <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, 27, and her two grandchildren, who also live at the four-room home, were away at the time. State of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest, security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest and a range of statements classified as subversive. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said leaders in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and other black townships had been asked `` to call upon the community not to act emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a spiral of violence.'' He leaders would try to talk to the principal and the students of the school involved to ease the situation. He said young men who congregate around the Mandela home were told `` not to act without thinking or with revenge.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the car. She then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts social welfare projects. Youths who guarded the house, some wearing jackets of the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club sponsored by the family, pushed journalists away from the office. One threatened to burn a photographer's car. Later, attorney <PERSON> Amrichand </PERSON> <PERSON> Soma </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was reached at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government, and said no statement should be made. For Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the fire was one of many hardships since her husband, a leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was jailed in 1962. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, received a life sentence in 1964 after being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the white-led government. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 54, has spent 17 months in solitary confinement, lived in isolation, been arrested several times and passed virtually her entire adult life under stringent police restrictions and public scrutiny. She was trained as a social worker. She has become a leading campaigner against apartheid and black activists often call her `` Mother of the Nation.'' Another result of her prominence is that some of her personal hardships become public events. When she visits her husband in prison, journalists are present. By the time she reached her burned-out home Thursday it was surrounded by firefighters, police and journalists who already had wandered through the smoldering remains. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> moved into the modest four-room bungalow in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s huge black township, after she married <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in 1958. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had owned the house and lived in it since the 1940s. It has been shot at and stoned by attackers who have not been identified. Police visit it regularly.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s latest efforts to obtain the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was coolly received by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said he did n't know all the facts about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s effort, `` but as a general matter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy. The Democratic nominee said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> should handle the hostage issue and said a quick end to the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war would expedite the release of the hostages. `` I think they are beginning to make some progress,'' on an end to the war, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I think the secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is the person to provide that mediation.'' Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, campaigning in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, echoed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views, saying, `` I normally under most conditions like to see officials of the government carrying out any negotiations. `` I must say <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has ... been very effective at times in the past in doing some of these things,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator added. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he issued an appeal through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to impress upon Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> that the release of the hostages is `` moral and humanitarian.'' He said he asked <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` to appeal to the foreign minister to hear our humanitarian plea _ to hear our mercy appeal _ and to use his strength to help gain the release of the Americans held hostage.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` no meeting has been set, and no meeting has been sought'' for him to negotiate with Iranian officials. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said the country's foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, will not meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to discuss the possible release of hostages. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to discuss ending the Iran-Iraq war. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, offered to help get the nine Americans freed if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would release Iranian assets frozen since 1979. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration responded that it will make no deals for the hostages' release. The hostages are believed to be held by Shiite Moslems with links to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had said he is using several Middle Eastern diplomats as intermediaries in his attempts to negotiate the hostages' release. In January 1984, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met directly with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and arranged the release of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, whose plane was shot down over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Dec. 4, 1983, during an American air strike against a Syrian anti-aircraft position.

 Police raided an apartment before dawn today and arrested eight people, including renegade soldiers, believed linked to ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, officials said. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy commander of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said police seized one claymore mine, plastic explosives and improvised bombs that may have been intended for terror attacks in the capital. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said the raid at about 4:30 a.m. was in a crowded neighborhood of suburban <LOCATION> Caloocan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said the eight included two women and at least two army enlisted men. Two or three others escaped, and `` some tried to escape by climbing the walls and climbing to the rooftop,'' he said. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said the eight were being interrogated and could face charges of illegal possession of weapons and explosives. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who ruled the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for 20 years, was deposed in February 1986 in a civilian-military uprising that swept President <PERSON> Corozon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said one of those arrested was linked to an abortive April 1987 raid on <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bonifacio </LOCATION>, which the military said was an attempt to free rebel troops jailed in a coup attempt three months before. The government said the January 1987 coup attempt was aimed at restoring <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to power. The attempt included attacks on media and military facilities in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said some of those arrested were also suspected of involvement in a similar raid last June on Camp Crame, where mutineers failed to free jailed coup plotters but made off with two dozen rifles. He said raiders also found street maps and other diagrams that they suspected may have been used in planning bombings within the capital. On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s chief aide accused <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of trying to evade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prosecution by offering $ 5 billion to come home. `` We saw it for what it was. It was just a ploy to get his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment against him suspended,'' Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow the former president to return from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> reported this month that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with real estate acquisitions in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 A man convicted in the stabbing death of his 8-year-old niece was put to death in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s electric chair, prompting the victim's mother to remark, `` We can finally put our baby to rest.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> died a little more than an hour after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a 7-2 vote, refused to stop the execution. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> dissented, but there was no immediate elaboration from the court. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> abducted <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> from her school in 1979 and tried to molest her. She bled to death after being beaten and stabbed. The victim's father, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, 47, said <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s execution was a `` big relief. He finally paid.'' <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, 34, was pronounced dead at 7:23 p.m., said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>. He was the 13th person to die in the state's electric chair since <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> resumed executions in 1983 and the 101st person put to death since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to restore capital punishment in 1976. `` We feel we can finally put our baby to rest,'' said the victim's mother, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Cedartown </LOCATION>, one of about 20 death penalty advocates who carried placards and demonstrated in front of the prison Thursday. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> declined to make a final statement, but requested a prayer. Prison Chaplain <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> LaVell </PERSON> placed his hands on <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s left forearm and delivered a one-minute prayer while the condemned man held his eyes tightly shut At the conclusion of the prayer, <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> said, `` Amen'' and that was his last word. Fourteen people witnessed the execution, including seven state witnesses, one of <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchell </PERSON>, and six media representatives. Outside the prison, 12 anti-death penalty protesters sang. Nearly twice as many pro-death penalty demonstrators, including one man wearing a white <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klu </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> robe, cheered and clapped when <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s body was driven out of the prison in a hearse. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> did not ask for any witnesses to the execution, <PERSON> Siler </PERSON> said. His mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> LaGrange </ORGANIZATION>, and an aunt visited him at the prison Wednesday. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Paroles refused to commute <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s sentence to life in prison. Chairman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said the panel concluded `` there are insufficient grounds for further consideration'' of the commutation rquest. Snow said the board rejected a psychiatrist's testimony that <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>'s `` explosive'' behavior may have been caused by brain damage. <PERSON> Messer </PERSON> exhibited no such behavior in prison, he said, and the testimony was `` not a matter that we can base a decision on a crime that occurred nine years ago.''

<HEAD>`L.A. Law,' `Golden Girls' and New Shows Dominate Emmy List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The legal power plays portrayed in the pin-striped world of `` L.A. Law'' and the shenanigans of `` The Golden Girls'' led Emmy contenders in nominations for television excellence. Cable shows won 15 nominations in their first outing against the networks, and a surprising 22 were garnered by two new shows _ the forbidden life of `` Beauty and the Beast'' beneath <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and `` thirtysomething,'' which focuses on the ups and downs of the baby boomer generation. It was the gripping courtroom and corridor intrigue of `` L.A. Law'' and its polished cast that earned 19 nominations for the 40th annual Emmy Awards. `` We have good stories and that great ensemble group,'' producer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> said. `` We draw inspiration from their ability.'' Noteworthy, too, were two <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> shows overlooked by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>: Only one nomination was given TV's most-watched series `` The Cosby Show'' and its spin-off `` A Different World'' got none Last year's trendy `` Moonlighting,'' a nominations leader last year, was also fading, capturing six nominations and none in major categories. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> led the networks with 114 nominations, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> with 87 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> with 75. The <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the so-called `` fourth network,'' collected six Emmy nominations. Syndicated shows were nominated 13 times. Among cable companies, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON> each claimed six nominations. The Disney Channel drew two nominations and <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> had one. Shows on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were nominated 27 times. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> will broadcast the Emmy ceremony Aug. 28 from the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> Civic Auditorium. `` L.A. Law'' was selected in the categories of best drama series, best actor in a drama series for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON> and best actress in a drama series for <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dey </PERSON>. The on-screen and real life husband-wife duo <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>, called the `` Tucker-Berrys'' by the `` L.A. Law'' crew, were out of town. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was doing a film in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and his wife was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who won three years ago for her `` Golden Girls'' role, said of her third nomination for best actress in a comedy series: `` I do n't take it lightly. It's your peer group saying they like you.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s comedy `` Cheers'' received 11 nominations, including one for new cast member <LOCATION> Kirstie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> for best actress in a comedy series. The 10 for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething'' was a surprise for its producers. `` We're thrilled and surprised that a new show has generated this kind of recognition,'' said co-producer <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Herskovitz </PERSON>. Actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Busfield </PERSON>, nominated for supporting actor in `` thirtysomething,'' was named for an episode involving marriage counseling. `` I owe this to all the women I've ever had fights with,'' he said. The `` L.A. Law'' sweep came despite a divisive flap that began last year between series co-creators <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. At one point, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> was barred from the `` L.A. Law'' offices. She subsequently was forced to quit the show. But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> received two nominations for `` L.A. Law'' scripts while <PERSON> Bochco </PERSON> had just one. Joining `` L.A. Law'' in the best drama series competition will be `` Beauty and the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' `` St. Elsewhere'' and `` thirtysomething.'' `` L.A. Law'' won last year. Nominated for best comedy program were `` Cheers,'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Wonder Years'' and last year's winner, `` The Golden Girls. `` We're jumping up and down here. I was watching the ` Today Show' and during the break the local news announced the nominations. We started jumping, said producer <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of `` The Golden Girls'' and `` Beauty and the Beast. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> was overwhelmed by two nominations won by the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>,'' including leading actress in a miniseries or special and best drama-comedy special. It dealt with her battle with breast cancer. `` I'm very honored and very thrilled, but the nomination is n't for me It goes for all those ladies who had to go through this. I tried to do this with dignity and above all hope. I'm so grateful.'' Named for best miniseries were `` Baby M,'' `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Billionaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` The Murder of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phagan </PERSON>. For best variety music or comedy program, the nominees were <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Irving <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s 100th Birthday Celebration,'' CBS' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Smothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hour </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` The Tracey Ullman Show'' and two episodes of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. The Board of Governors award this year goes to cartoon masters <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>. Cable shows were eligible for Emmys this year because national cable networks are now available to more than 50 percent of the country.

 Despite the drought, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food exporters this year can remain reliable sources for foreign nations that depend on them and should make it their top priority to do so, says Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. `` This year, even though our crops are way down, combining our crops with our carryover, we'll have an ample supply for both our domestic and our export needs,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Thursday at an Illinois-Japan agricultural trade conference. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which depends on imports for 50 percent of its food, is the `` best customer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. The Japanese are expected to buy $ 6.5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products this year, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Randal </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, co-sponsor of the conference. `` If you think about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge purchases from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and their dependence upon us, we must make it clear that ... even in a year when we have a drought ... we will not restrict exports to protect purchases within our own country,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` It's absolutely essential that we assure <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that we will have enough, that we will be responsible,'' he added in his 15-minute talk to about 200 people at the conference, co-sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owes a `` debt of gratitude'' to the Japanese for their recent agreement to dismantle many of the trade barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products such as beef, citrus fruits, juices, ice cream, processed cheeses and sugar-based goods `` I compliment the Japanese for their effort to modernize and update and improve their access,'' he said at a news conference after his talk. `` It's not easy for them to do that.'' <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, Japanese ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> need to be aggressive in their marketing efforts to his country, because there are many foreign competitors. He reiterated <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s call for reliability among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suppliers, noting that past <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export restrictions still evoke `` bitter'' memories. In the early 1970s, a feared shortage of soybeans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> prompted an embargo that forced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> unexpectedly to seek other markets to fulfill its high demand for soybean products, <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law as well as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy now supports unrestricted international trade regardless of conditions at home. On the topic of drought relief for American farmers, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said the $ 6 billion measure approved in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is `` a pretty good bill,'' despite some provisions the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes and some efforts by lobbyists to use the legislation for special interests.

 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> party's newspaper saluted a convoy of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans that brought food, medicine and clothing with a banner headline reading, `` Veterans Break <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON>. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> said in its Thursday edition that thousands of people greeted the convoy of 20 vehicles and 44 activists when it crossed the Honduran-Nicaraguan border the day before, after months of opposition from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The Veterans' Peace Convoy was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s downtown Revolution Plaza today, where it will turn over its shipment to the leftist government The veterans oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of Nicaraguan Contra rebels, who have waged a 7-year-old war to topple the Sandinista government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> opposed letting the convoy cross the U.S.-Mexico border, saying taking the vehicles to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would violate a 1985 trade embargo. Humanitarian aid is permitted under the embargo, but the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says the vehicles must return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The newspaper said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police `` brutally repressed'' the group in its attempt to bring `` medicine, food and clothes for Nicaraguan children butchered by the war action of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.'' Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> bridge crossing in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The convoy finally crossed the Mexican border at <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on July 14.

The veterans refused to sign forms promising they would return the trucks.

<HEAD>Parliament Remains Divided On New Abortion Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament rejected proposals for a new abortion law ranging from freedom of choice to a ban except in cases of a threat to the pregnant woman's life. Also Thursday, the British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> ruled that a fetus is not a person. The national government began searching for a new abortion law after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in January struck down <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s restrictive abortion law. The lack of a new law has brought abortion-on-demand to many cities and led to angry protests from anti-abortion groups. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s government, itself split on the issue, proposed a compromise in which abortion would be easy to obtain early in pregnancy but restricted later on. That proposal was defeated 147 to 76, and other proposed measures also fell. The voting followed a two-day debate, and the issue now goes back to the drawing board. Opposition parties criticized <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for staying out of the debate or revealing his own views. But with a general election expected this fall, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> can go to voters saying that he tried to propose a compromise. The British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> ruled Thursday that a newborn becomes a person only after it leaves the mother's body alive. The decision overturned the conviction of two midwives charged with criminal negligence in the death of a fetus in 1985. But the court upheld their conviction on charges of causing bodily harm to the pregnant woman. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to deliver its view this fall on whether a fetus has any rights.

<HEAD>Ambassador Switches Plea to Guilty in Cocaine Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The former Honduran ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> faces a possible life sentence after pleading guilty to charges of attempting to smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine hidden in coffee bags in his luggage. <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, 49, was arrested May 15 at Miami International Airport and immediately stripped of his diplomatic immunity by Honduran officials. <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> had initially pleaded innocent, but on Thursday he told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> he wanted to change his plea to guilty of importing cocaine. In return, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> said the government was dropping a second charge of possession with intent to distribute. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> that he faces at least 10 years in prison and could be sentenced to life, as well as fined $ 4 million on the importation charge. He asked the former ambassador if he understood. `` Yes, your honor, I do,'' <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> responded through an interpreter. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> set sentencing for Sept. 14. <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> refused to comment on the case or the plea bargain, but federal sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the investigation was continuing. <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> has been held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> since his arrest. Honduran authorities cooperated with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug investigators in the case, and even threatened to try <PERSON> Regalado </PERSON> in his homeland if he tried to return there. Prosecutors had asked he be held without bond prior to his plea because <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Ten days after their arrests during the Democratic National Convention, 96 anti-abortion protesters who refuse to give their names remain jailed, most vowing to stay until their next court date or the city frees them. Lawyers said Thursday that the jailed protesters, charged with criminal trespass, can not be freed on bond until they give verifiable proof of their identities. `` If we can identify them ... we can try them,'' explained <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s chief assistant solicitor. He said the offense carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of $ 1,000. `` Demonstrators like this ... do all they can to frustrate the system,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` If in so doing they are willing to spend more time in jail than they would have, if any, so be it. It really depends on how far they want to carry it.'' The protesters, part of an anti-abortion effort called Operation Rescue, were among 134 arrested July 19 at a clinic near downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> where abortions are performed. The city began processing them through the court system this week. `` We just hope the city will realize it made a mistake and just let us go,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the protesters who is not jailed. `` We have served more time even than we would have if we had been found guilty'' of criminal trespass. On Thursday, a man calling himself Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> 105 and a woman calling herself Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> 111 clutched Bibles as they stood silently in Municipal Court. A man calling himself Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> 132 was dressed as a priest. The protesters, who are being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, say they have taken the names in solidarity with aborted fetuses. Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, however, referred to the prisoners as `` White Male 42,'' or `` White Female 47,'' as he methodically sent their cases to state court. Thirty-two of those arrested last week have given their names and been released on $ 500 recognizance bonds, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pocock </PERSON>, deputy director of the corrections center. He said six others were identified through other means. The demonstrators have been brought into court in groups of seven or eight for their brief appearances before being returned to jail. The remaining 23 demonstrators were to appear today. `` We have 75 percent of our people committed to stay -LRB- in jail -RRB- until their court hearing, assuming it is within the next month or so,'' said <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. It normally takes two to three months for such a case to reach state court. `` Most of our local people are in jail,'' <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. Supporters are coming in from outside the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area, and there would be large demonstrations in the coming weeks, he said, but declined to elaborate. Similarly charged demonstrators arrested during an anti-nuclear protest at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> offices during the convention were sentenced to the five days they had spent awaiting a court appearance and were freed. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fierer </PERSON>, who is representing the demonstrators in court, said he does not know whether some will reveal their identities to get out of jail. `` These are people of conscience,'' he said this week. `` They have to make their own decisions about these sorts of things.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Assembly today appointed 15 delegates for parliamentary talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on various tesion-easing measures and the Olympic Games. National Assembly officials said a South Korean letter proposing the talks will be delivered to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panmunjon </LOCATION>, the border truce site, on Monday. The letter will also ask <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to send an equal number of delegates to the border village for the talks, the officials said. The naming of the delegates was endorsed today by the heads of the nation's four main political parties, who approved plans for the talks worked out by their aides earlier this week. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has proposed that the full legislatures of the two nations meet in August to discuss a non-aggression pact and <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s possible entry into the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. In a letter delivered Thursday last week, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suggested the two sides skip working contacts to prepare for the joint parliamentary conference. But <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials say preliminary talks are needed to set an agenda and other details. The delegates picked today _ six governing and nine opposition lawmakers _ would attend preliminary talks at <LOCATION> Panmunjon </LOCATION> in the second week of August if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agrees <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials suggested a date between Aug. 13 and 15. The non-aggression pact and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to co-host the Olympics would be high on the agenda, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegates also plan to raise other tension-easing measures, including reuniting separated family members. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it would boycott the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics unless its demand to co-host the Games is accepted The International Olympic Committee rejected the demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city. The two Koreas remain as bitter rivals since the division of the Korean land at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the three-year Korean War that ended in standoff in 1953.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ An ex-militiaman of deposed dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was acquitted of charges he fatally shot a 21-year-old waitress, and her father tried to kill himself when the case ended, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> stood on the front steps of the Palace of Justice and slashed his throat with a razor blade, the independent radio station said Thursday. He was rushed to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, where he was reported in stable condition. The radio said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> tried to kill himself Wednesday after a jury acquitted <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON>, 45, a former member of the dreaded Tonton Mocoutes militia, in the killing of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>. She was shot and killed by two gunmen firing from a speeding car in front of the capital's <LOCATION> Tiffany </LOCATION> restaurant, where she worked, on Jan. 31, 1986 _ one week before <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was ousted and fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The motive for the killing was not known. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> originally was convicted last year and sentenced to death in the killing, but an <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the conviction on a legal technicality and ordered a retrial. The <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> retrial was held Wednesday, and the jury acquitted <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> after two witnesses failed to show up for unexplained reasons, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported. The witnesses, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Eustache </PERSON>, swore they saw <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> and another Macoute in the car from which gunfire was sprayed at <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and other restaurant employees. The second Macoute was not captured. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> Inter said the jury expressed hostility toward the victim's father, and the prosecuting attorney did not press the defense witnesses with questions. Several spectators marched out of the courtroom in disgust before the jury acquitted <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON>, the radio station said.

 Hundreds of unashamed men and women are gathering for a convention at a remote campground this weekend to elect officers, organize committees _ and get naked. Along with serious business, the free-wheeling nudists of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ and their equally unabashed children _ plan to lie in the sun, swim and play ping-pong, shuffleboard and volleyball. `` Looking is not a no-no, but staring is,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, an electronics engineer and president of the larger <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure the staring is much worse out among the ` textiles.''' `` Textiles,'' the nudist term for people who wear clothes all the time in the `` textile world,'' are aliens at White Thorn Lodge. `` Most people seek the breeze, the sun, the rain and the freedom of wearing no pantyhose,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, 44, a free-lance writer from <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` You tell the first lie of the day when you put your clothes on.'' About 1,000 nudists are expected to show up over the weekend at <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, a pleasant campground on the <LOCATION> Ohio-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, according to lodge secretary <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathesius </PERSON>. Convention security was tight Thursday. Clothed and nude men guarded the gate. Reporters who shed only their ties were escorted among friendly families sharing lunch at picnic tables, smiling couples sitting on shaded lawn chairs, and naked children running across the grass. `` It's the freedom. It's the comfort. Our society equates nudity with sexuality, but this is a totally non-sexual setting. People are just people here,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a nudism activist who brought her husband and children to the convention. `` I just like the swimming pool, the hot tub and the food,'' said her son, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON>, 8, a third-grader who wore only cherry soda on his face. The association's membership comprises 55 percent of the 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which helps publicize nudism and rates nudist colonies. Nudists come in all ages, sizes and shapes, including smooth, wrinkled and scarred. Some live in cabins, recreational vehicles and tents on the grounds. On Thursday, all sat on towels and wore convention credentials on chains around their necks. With temperatures in the high 80s, some wore only sneakers and some only T-shirts. Since no one has pockets, the snack bar runs a tab for hamburgers and soft drinks. Officials said only about 10 percent of card-carrying nudists are unmarried. Women are always wanted. `` There's a problem getting women here, but then why do n't many women go into bars by themselves?'' Ms. <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON> said. `` When they find out what it's all about, they say, ` Why did it take me so long?''' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said `` pockets of intolerance'' have limited nudism to homes or to the `` social or recreational'' campgrounds, health clubs and remote beaches. But, he said, surveys among nudists show only about 15 percent disrobe to get an all-over tan. `` We wear sunscreen when it's appropriate. We're very aware of our bodies,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` When it's cold, we put clothes on,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>. `` We're not fanatics.''

 Palestinians in the occupied territories blocked streets and stayed away from work today to show support for women jailed for their roles in the Palestinian uprising. Also, state-run radio said a Palestinian who died in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Thursday was killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops as he prepared to throw a firebomb. The death touched off demonstrations in which two Palestinians were wounded by gunfire and two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> riot police were injured by stones. Palestinians throughout the occupied lands went on strike today. Outlawed Palestinian flags waved on utility poles from <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Graffiti appeared on walls overnight reading `` Death to the Zionists'' and `` Yes for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state.'' Before dawn, Palestinian protesters blocked some streets with rocks, barrels and burning tires, an apparent effort to prevent Palestinians from breaking the strike organized by the underground leadership of the uprising that began Dec. 8. The strike, called to protest the jailing of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women, halted transportation and shut down shops. The Palestinian-run <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said 30 Palestinian women are being held in Israeli jails, most on suspicion of inciting violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An Israeli army spokesman said the army was checking the report on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s state-run radio that troops fatally shot 37-year-old <PERSON> Hadel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> el Toruk in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He died in <LOCATION> Ahali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of wounds sustained on July 22, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating the circumstances. <PERSON> Toruk </PERSON>'s family told the army he was shot at the same time soldiers opened fire at Palestinians who threw a Molotov cocktail at them. <PERSON> Toruk </PERSON> said before he died that he did not see his assailants, a hospital official said. `` He said he was walking in the street, and then he fell down, and he did n't know what happened,'' said the hospital official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The fatality brought to 235 the number of Palestinians killed in the anti-Israeli revolt. Four Israelis also have died. Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he reacted positively to reports that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> planned to meet with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he was against meetings with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is banned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but did not necessarily oppose meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. `` We make a distinction between people who are members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is an organization that deals in terrorism and has a charter that calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on Israeli television. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is to leave next week for a peace mission that will take him to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> said Thursday she was unaware of plans for <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> to talk to Palestinian leaders. She also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of refusing to meet <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders remained in place. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> previously has called for negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a joint <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. But on Thursday, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said it was changing its policy toward the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories to give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> more responsibility there and avoid friction between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Toward this end, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> announced it was halting a $ 1.3 billion, 5-year development project in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The plan was set up in 1986 by agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> experts also will go to the area where the plane crashed into the sea near the Iranian island of <LOCATION> Hengham </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the Iranian agency said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The experts will stay in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for a week, the news agency said.

The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team left the gulf Thursday after spending 3 -LCB- weeks in the region, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

 Two men who fled to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> after killing two people during a failed bank heist were returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and sentenced to death, an official newspaper reported today. The People's Daily saod <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> extradited <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Danian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yueping </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in February after they sneaked across the border. The paper said <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and another accomplice were running a business in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province that went into debt. To pay back the debt they decided to start robbing banks. It said the trio began robbing banks in June 1987, striking among others the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the Industrial and <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Yueyang </LOCATION>. The paper said they failed to steal any money. On July 7, 1987, the paper said, the trio broke into another <LOCATION> Yueyang </LOCATION> bank and killed a bank guard and a clerk. Still, no money was stolen, it said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> then fled to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Their accomplice, <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maohua </PERSON>, stayed behind and was captured. The paper said the three were sentenced on Monday and would be executed soon. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> executes people with a bullet to the back of the head. Chinese papers have been devoting more space to reports on crime in recent years. In almost every case, when they report on bank heists, the papers say the robberies end in failure. The apparent reason for this is that the state-run press does n't want to encourage copycat crimes

 A defense lawyer says the Mexicans charged in the barbaric killing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent are innocent victims, and he has evidence of a huge coverup designed to protect the highest Mexican officials. The three men charged in the kidnapping and murder of <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, are victims of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s corrupt judicial system, defense attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> said in opening arguments Thursday. `` People destroyed, altered and failed to preserve evidence,'' <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> told the jury. `` When you see the widespread corruption, it becomes impossible to see who is reliable.'' The prosecutor in the case said that <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> died in a torture chamber at the hands of people trying to elicit information about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug investigation. `` Special agent <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s skull was fractured in numerous places, in the front of the head and in the back of the head. It resembled, basically, a cracked eggshell,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON>. `` At the top of the skull, the skull had actually been penetrated by a blunt instrument, that an object had been driven through the skull,'' he said. <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON>, however, contends the people responsible for <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s slaying are in a safe haven in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> The sensitivity of the grisly case was evident at the entrance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON>'s courtroom, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals had set up a metal detector, in addition to security checks made at the courthouse entrances. The trial is expected to take about 10 weeks. The bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, were found buried at a remote ranch in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> several weeks after they were abducted separately in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1985. On trial are <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, who are charged with murdering <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, who is charged with being an accessory. They were among nine people indicted in the case by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this year. Four are in custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, one was killed by Mexican police and one is at large. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped in 1985 as he left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> after he and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking operation said to have been run by reputed Mexican drug lord <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> also is charged in the killings and is in custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The prosecution alleges <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was tortured in an effort to make him provide information about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigation into <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s activities.

<TEXT>
 It began as a spur-of-the-moment spoof, a lighthearted jab at <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>'s upper crust and their yearly social gala, the Cotton Ball. But the Kudzu Ball, showing a tenacity its leafy little namesake would be proud of, has slowly become an annual event in its own right in this <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> river town. `` People just like to get out and have a good time,'' L.R. `` Tex'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, one of the ball's founders, said Thursday. `` It's inexpensive, it's for a good cause. And it gives people a chance to act like a bunch of kids. It's just fun.'' The seventh annual Kudzu Ball, complete with its own king and queen, bluegrass bands and a best-costume contest, is set for tonight at the Town and Country Shopping Center in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>. Well, not exactly the shopping center itself _ the parking lot outside <ORGANIZATION> JB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Friends, a night spot where the idea was hatched for a kooky celebration of the South's most famous weed. `` A group of pseudo-intellectuals was sitting there one night, and we decided that to quaff'em once or twice a week, we needed a purpose,'' said <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>. `` Somebody said, ` Let's have a ball.' And one of us looked out the window, and there was kudzu all over this hill next to the bar, and someone said, ` How about a kudzu ball?''' Kudzu, as any Southerner worth his grits knows, is the Oriental vine introduced to <ORGANIZATION> Dixie </ORGANIZATION> 50 years ago to stop soil erosion. The problem was that the pesky little weed did n't know when to stop. It's been known to grow a foot overnight and has proven impervious to most efforts to kill it. Today, the creeping, choking vine blankets seven million acres in 12 southeastern states, not to mention telephone poles, cars, houses and lazy dogs who snooze in one place too long. All of which made it the perfect inspiration for an offbeat ball that's always been held the same night as the more socially polite Cotton Ball, itself named for the South's other famous plant. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> admits the organizing group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Long-Range-Way-Down-the-Road-and-Out-of-Sight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, may have had an assist from the Swine Ball, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s takeoff on its own <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ball </LOCATION>. But the Kudzu Ball has taken on an identity of its own, drawing 5,000 to 7,000 people a year into the cozy little parking lot, many of them festooned with snips of the wily weed. `` They like to be like the kudzu itself _ all cluttered up and close together, like a bunch of sheep,'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said. Tickets are $ 5 each _ the event has raised about $ 43,000 for the <ORGANIZATION> Chattanooga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> over the years _ but organizers say some of the costumes alone are worth that price. You might see a green-tinted dog with a sign reading `` Kudzu MacKenzie,'' or a rugged, bandoleer-and-kudzu-draped commando calling himself <PERSON> Kudzo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> routinely shows up as a bandanaed balladeer named <PERSON> Kudzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, and this year's ball promises a debate between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukudzu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. There's plenty of bluegrass music, vendors have been known to sell a beer or two, and the festivities general wind up with the selection of a king and queen from a 12-member court. It took awhile for the Cotton Ball organizers to get used to the parody celebration. But now, said <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, they've apparently accepted it, since some of the debutantes usually show up at the Kudzu Ball after their event is over. `` Now, we have never been invited to theirs. And I do n't think we're going to,'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said, chuckling. `` Which I do n't blame'em. I would n't ask me in, either.''

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Spurts But Greenspan Calms Inflation Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says consumer spending increased at the fastest pace in 10 months during June, but <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has renewed a pledge to keep a tight rein on credit to control inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday said personal consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except interest on debt, shot up a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in June, the steepest climb since a 1.3 percent gain last August. The report was disappointing to many economists who were expecting growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow the nation's trade deficit. In another economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said import prices, one of the main inflationary threats facing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy because of the weaker dollar, rose 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest increase in more than a year. The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months of 1987. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in an appearance before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee, said the 4.7-percent inflation figure released Wednesday as part of a report on the second-quarter gross national product was `` somewhat larger than we would have expected.'' But he said recent economic indicators have shown no evidence that would cause the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to radically change its monetary policy. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has indicated before that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would move to tighten credit if necessary to curb higher inflation. In the financial markets, bond prices _ usually most sensitive to news of inflation _ fell slightly and interest rates rose. The yield on the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond was quoted late in the day at 9.25 percent, up from 9.23 percent late Wednesday. Stock prices rose modestly. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 28.63 to close at 2,082.33, erasing Wednesday's 20-point drop Also Thursday, the administration projected the federal deficit for the upcoming budget year at $ 140.1 billion _ short of the trigger for across-the-board spending cuts. But officials warned that a hefty drought-relief bill could cause the automatic reductions to kick in.

<HEAD>Researchers Close To Identifying Gene Defect In Fatal Disorder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAR HARBOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers are close to identifying the gene responsible for an inherited disorder in which a simple inability to break down and dispose of certain fats can kill seemingly healthy boys. As the researchers close in on the gene, they are testing a specially formulated diet that may prevent the appearance of the disease in boys and men who have inherited the genetic defect, said the leader of the research team, Dr. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The discovery of the gene may allow researchers to insert normal cells into the victims' bodies to cure the disorder, in which apparently healthy boys suddenly lose mental faculties, got into a coma and die. <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said Thursday at a genetics meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, that the disease, which occurs in perhaps one in 10,000 or one in 20,000 people, has a devastating effect on families. In its most severe form, it usually strikes boys 4 to 8 years old, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. They deteriorate to a vegetative state within a year, and they remain in that state for up to 10 years before dying, he said. `` You can imagine what that does to the family,'' he said. Before the disease appears, the boys have no signs of illness, he said. One boy lost the ability to distinguish speech early in the disease and could understand his mother only by reading her lips. Shortly after <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> determined this, he got a call saying the boy had lost his vision _ and with it the ability to communicate with his mother. `` Somehow the devastation of a normal child is even harder to take than a child that is born impaired,'' <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. The disease, called adrenoleukodystrophy, is caused by the lack of an enzyme that helps the body break down and dispose of certain fats. In people with the disorder, the abnormal build-up of these fats, which are called long-chain fatty acids, damages the adrenal gland, causing hormonal problems, and the insulation surrounding nerve cells, causing brain damage. For reasons that scientists do not understand, some victims of the disease experience only mild problems in adulthood and others have no symptoms whatsoever. <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> estimated that 50 percent have the severe childhood form, 30 percent the milder adult form, 10 percent only hormonal imbalances and 10 percent no symptoms at all. The genetic defect that causes it can be identified in the fetus before birth, giving parents the option to terminate the pregnancy, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> told of one family of an aolescent boy who is a champion athlete and who carries the genetic defect but has no signs of disease. His parents have decided not to tell him that he has the disease, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> and his colleagues have now devised a low-fat diet that helps prevent the build-up of fats in these children. They are testing the diet now, and do not yet know whether preventing the fat build-up in these patients will indeed prevent the disease, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. Bone marrow transplants have also been used in four cases to try to prevent the disease, he said, but bone marrow transplants pose a tricky ethical question, he said. As many as 20 percent ot 30 percent of people who get bone marrow transplants die as a result of the transplants. Yet half of the victims of adrenoleukodystrophy do not get the severe childhood disease, so it may be unwise to recommend such a dangerous procedure for them, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said. Scientists do not yet know how to predict which people with the defect will be severely affected and which will be only mildly affected, but they are working diligently to determine that, <PERSON> Moser </PERSON> said.

 Three Sinhalese extremists and a soldier were killed and militants torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said people were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the Indian-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island's south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, about 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island's north and east until Sunday morning to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist group from the island's majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Three men were killed by police in separate incidents in which Sinhalese extremists tried to attack government property, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said a Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with extremists in <LOCATION> Hambantota </LOCATION> district in the south. In southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, strongholds of the Sinhalese extremists, at least eight government-owned buses were set afire Thursday night and this morning, the police spokesman said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese extremists bew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island's north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were killed by Tamil rebels near <LOCATION> Padaviya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The peace accord, signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on July 29, 1987, calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, refused to accept the accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> regularly accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 people have been killed since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 percent and control the government and the army. More than 400 people have been killed since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been government officials or members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who signed the accord.

<HEAD>Palestinians Divided On Impact Of Jordanian Aid Cancellation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials today said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to cancel a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the Israeli-occupied territories would have no practical effect because the plan existed primarily on paper. Palestinian leaders in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were divided on the impact. Some said it would seriously hurt some residents already struggling financially because of the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> announced Thursday it was canceling the development program in a move to hand over more responsibility for the 1.5 million Arabs in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON>, an Israeli expert on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said he thought the move was the first step toward a decision by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> eventually to cut ties with the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> altogether `` He wants to see how people react. But ultimately he has no choice but to cut ties,'' <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a U.S.-funded research project, said in an interview. `` If he does n't, he gives money to people who in the long run are his enemies,'' said <PERSON> Benvenisti </PERSON>, referring to a growing anti-Jordanian slant among <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s plan `` was a bubble. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> did n't have the money for the project. He hoped to get foreign governments to donate funds.'' It is difficult to gauge how much of the $ 1.3 billion has reached the occupied territories.

<HEAD>North Korean Parliament Proposes U.S. Talks On '53 Armistice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today said it proposed a conference with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers so the nations can discuss a peace accord that would replace the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the proposal was made by Chairman <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sop </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in a letter sent to the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> proposed that the talks be held at the earliest possible date in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or any third country between the two delegations, each comprising seven to nine legislators. `` It would be good to discuss measures for cooperation between the two parliaments in replacing the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> armistice agreement with a peace agreement,'' it quoted <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s letter as saying. The armistice was signed by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on one side and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, led by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on the other. It ended the bloody Korean War, which began in 1950 when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in an attempt to unify the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula by force. Protesters in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sign a peace treaty that would replace the armistice agreement. The two Koreas are technically still at war, since no treaty has been signed. Last week, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sent a proposal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> calling for joint sessions between their legislatures to draw up a non-aggression pact to end the enmity and rivalry that have prevailed since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> said it was ready to accept the North Korean call for talks on the non-aggression pact and the North's possible participation in the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September. The latest <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peace offer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the first in four years. In 1984, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> proposed a tripartite conference among the two Koreas and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seek a permanent peace and an eventual reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The 1984 proposal was rejected by both <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on grounds that peace and unification were matters to be settled between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION>. After the 1984 proposal, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, at a state dinner honoring Chinese Premier <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told reporters, `` It would be just wonderful if there would be a four-way conference with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and both Koreas and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The latest proposal was made in cordial, diplomatic language free from the North's usual vitriolic hyperbole. `` The best way we and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can choose at present is to have peace negotiation to slacken the whetting swords and firing guns against each other or cease them completely,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s letter said. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said he made the proposal `` recognizing that we and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, directly responsible parties for easing tension and providing peace in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, must sit at the table as soon as possible.''

<HEAD>Government Rejects Peace Talks With Leftist Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said his government would not participate in church-sponsored peace talks today with leftist guerrillas and that any insurgents who come to the table will be jailed. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s decision Thursday dashed hopes for a quick settlement to a guerrilla war that killed 75,000 people in 25 years. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> acted after military leaders criticized the proposed talks. But Barco, in a communique, said his government planned to study recommendations by the conference. The meeting was to include church leaders, former presidents, 20 congressmen and a former presidential candidate who was kidnapped and later freed by the guerrillas. The leader of the April 19 Movement, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizarro </PERSON> <PERSON> Leongomez </PERSON>, planned to send a tape-recorded message to the gathering, a <PERSON> Pizarro </PERSON> spokesman, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, said at a news conference Thursday. The spokesman said the government decision not to participate could be a mistake. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 guerrillas operate in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The guerrilla group, also known as M-19, demanded peace talks as a condition for the release earlier this month of the former presidential candidate it kidnapped. The government refused to meet the demand for the release of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, who was abducted May 29 in a hail of submachine-gun fire in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. The guerrilla group released <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> anyway and the government said it would think about negotating with the insurgents. Church leaders and members of the country's two leading political groups, the Conservative and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> parties, met in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> with M-19 guerrillas to win <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s release. Those who met with the guerrillas said that regardless of the government's decision they would organize a peace conference in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was freed. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, the son of former President <PERSON> Laureano </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, said he would attend. The M-19 also took over the <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> Nov. 7, 1985 in an attack that left 115 dead, including 11 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. Bishop <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> has been the driving force behind organizing the peace conference. After meeting Thursday with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> at the presidential palace, he revealed the government's refusal to attend the peace conference and said he could understand the difficult position <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> is in. <PERSON> Castrillon </PERSON> did not elaborate, but he undoubtedly was referring to the military's opposition to peace talks. `` The nation wants to stop the war,'' the bishop said. `` It has to be stopped.'' The country's two most powerful generals, the minister of defense, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON>, and the head of the chiefs of staff, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, have said they oppose any peace talks with the rebels. But the two generals, in an apparent attempt to calm fears of a military coup attempt, also said they would abide by any government decision to negotiate with the insurgents. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s communique said his government might offer pardons to guerrillas for political crimes. But even that position left little hope of any reconciliation between the government and the guerrillas. Political crimes, by the government's definition, do not include the majority of guerrilla activities _ kidnappings, ambushes on army patrols and bloody raids on dozens of towns in the last 25 years.

 Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels said they pulled out of two towns in western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today after killing or wounding 40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards during three days of fighting. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces drove the rebels out of the Iranian towns of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, killing or wounding at least 1,000 enemy troops in a battle with the `` forces of the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> regime and their hypocritical mercenaries.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, representatives for both gulf war foes accused each other of blocking <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the nearly 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio interrupted its normal programs to play martial music and announce victory over the rebels, members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>. In a later announcement, the radio said Iranian forces were advancing in a bid to liberate the Iraqi-occupied Iranian towns of Sar-e Pol-e Zahab and Gilan-e <LOCATION> Gharb </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rebels operate a series of bases or camps along the border, usually just on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> side of the frontier. The rebel group said in a communique released in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that its guerrillas penetrated 95 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and controlled <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION> and Eslamabad near the central border for 72 hours. It said that during the fighting, two Iranian F-4 jet fighters and two Cobra helicopter gunships were shot down, and hundreds of tanks and armored personnel carriers were destroyed. The claims by the rebel group could not be independently confirmed. Reporters are allowed into battle areas only during rare guided tours. Earlier, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its forces broke through the defenses of the Iraqis and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said Thursday that Iranian forces killed at least 4,000 Iraqis and `` mercenaries'' in the battle. A communique issued Thursday by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military said its warplanes were bombing Iranian military airfields around <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demands a face-to-face meeting with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before a cease-fire, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> insists on a truce before it will consider a direct talks. Pressure was increasing on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that could prolong the fighting, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. The foreign ministers of both countries have met separately in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The talks were made possible on when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has suffered a series of battlefield setbacks in recent months, on July 18 accepted a year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accepted the resolution shortly after it was passed.

<TEXT>
 As sand trickled through an hourglass on <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s desk, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> humorously sought to deflate the windbag image he gained from a much-reviled speech at the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who has been called a windbag in <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s jokes about the speech, traded quips with the `` Tonight Show'' host Thursday before jamming on saxophone with the show's band. And he told <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> that, contrary to some opinions, his over-long introduction of the Democrats' presidential nominee, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was a stunning success. `` My sole goal was achieved,'' he said. `` I wanted so badly to make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> look great, and I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who had been given 15 minutes to introduce the governor, talked for more than twice that long. He said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` He called me a few days ago and he said he thought the speech was great, everything was forgiven and would I please nominate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said to applause and laughter from the show's studio audience. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> told the audience during his show's opening monologue that <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> was to be a guest, and added: `` Not to worry, we have plenty of black coffee and extra cots in the lobby.'' He later introduced <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> with a satirical, long-winded speech of his own that included details ranging from the governor's educational background to the first name of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> After <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> sat on the couch, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said, `` My first question is, How are you?'' <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> then turned over the hourglass. Later, saying he'd already proved he could mess up with his voice, the governor said he'd see if he could `` mess up with a song'' and impressed the crowd with his performance on tenor saxophone. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said the speech was unintentionally drawn out but was meant to introduce <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to millions of Americans who were n't familiar with his accomplishments Asked about his own ambitions for higher office, the governor said, `` Depends on how I do on the show tonight.''

<HEAD>Discovery's Test-Firing Postponed Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> today postponed the crucial launch pad test-firing of Discovery's three main engines another three days when an attempt to fuel the space shuttle ran into problems with equipment not used since the Challenger disaster. The postponement from Monday to Thursday was the third delay of the test in a week, and could put off the first post-Challenger shuttle flight _ already delayed until late September _ until October, officials said. Preparations for loading 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Discovery's fuel tank began Thursday night, but the launch team quickly had trouble with sensors and an oxygen pump. Technicians resolved those problems but a leak in a hydrogen line and another balky oxygen pump finally forced a postponement early today. The test will be postponed a minimum of 72 hours, with the launch team hoping to resume the first phase of the countdown Sunday night for the test-firing at 7:30 a.m. Thursday, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>. It was the first time a shuttle had been fueled on launch pad 39B since the Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing its crew of seven. All of the problems Thursday night and today were in ground support equipment and not on the shuttle itself. The first part of the countdown was to have ended this morning with a simulated problem and postponement just 10 seconds before a mock liftoff. The launch team then was to have emptied the fuel tank, started a new countdown and refilled the tank, targeting the test-firing for Monday. The firing will test several modifications made to the engines and is considered critical to certifying Discovery for flight. The latest shuttle difficulty came a day after engineers came up with a solution for a major problem. They recommended that cutting a hole through Discovery's cargo bay would be the quickest and best way to reach and fix a small gas leak in an engine compartment without removing the vehicle from the pad. The recommended repair would take about two weeks. The alternative would be to take Discovery back to a hangar, which could postpone the flight to as late as sometime in November. Cutting the 20-inch-square hole through the rear of the cargo bay would give engineers access to the tiny leak, which is on a vent line in an engine compartment. Once they cut through they would enshroud the leak in a clamshell device filled with a sealant. As a backup, the engineers recommended pushing a device resembling a badminton shuttlecock through the 27-foot-long line, trailed by a sealing agent. The two options were among several ideas tested to plug the leak without taking Discovery off the pad. The leak and the delays in the engine-firing countdown have pushed <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s internal working launch date to Sept. 13, and officials concede they are facing a late September launch even if they can fix the leak on the pad. The managers did not commit themselves to cutting the hole, because they want to see what happens after Discovery's three main engines are ignited for 20 seconds. Engineers said the firing, in which the shuttle will be bolted to the pad while its main engines generate ground-shaking thrust of 1.1 million pounds, could enlarge the leak or even lead to another problem that would require a rollback from the launch pad. The main engines are separate from the steering engine system that contains the leak.

 Missing <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newlyweds who sought `` perfect love'' while working anonymously in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delicatessens said they do n't feel compelled to make amends for the costly police search prompted by their disappearance. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said Thursday he believes it is the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police rank-and-file, rather than department officials, who want to see some kind of payment because they feel `` really gypped'' that they did n't find the college couple who dropped out of sight in April. `` It's like -LRB- the police said -RRB-, ` Here are some yuppie kids from <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. They just took off and we have no clues and we did n't know what to do.' And they look silly, so they might want to retaliate,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. `` Nobody cares, it's over with,'' said a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> officer in the missing persons bureau who declined to give his name. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>, who headed the investigation, said Wednesday police might try to recover the costs of their efforts. `` We are disheartened that we expended so many man-hours,'' he said. When <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>'s expensive car was found ransacked and with the engine running in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> alley, it prompted a multistate search as well as prayer vigils by classmates at <LOCATION> Wheaton </LOCATION>, a private, evangelical <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> college. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 23, and his bride, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, 22, said they find it difficult to explain why they vanished, leaving family and friends in anguish. `` We feel like we're on a different level than a lot of people in their relationship. ... <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>'s my life, and me to her, her to me. I would die for her and she would die for me,'' <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. The two were pursuing a `` perfect love'' that they felt was within reach if they escaped from the daily routine of life, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>'s father Wednesday. <PERSON> MacLean </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> after receiving a letter from the couple. `` We do forgive them, but they are going to have to put the pieces of their lives back together themselves,'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s mother, said Thursday from her suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home. The Swansons talked with the young couple by telephone but had not yet seen them. The newlyweds said they revealed their whereabouts after <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> was asked for her Social Security number by her delicatessen employer, which they feared would give them away. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said they `` do n't feel worthy'' to contact their friends right now, feeling that they failed them. `` It's a paradoxical situation, the hurt that we've caused and the benefit that's come from this,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said they came here because they `` did n't know anyone, and no one knew us. It has a climate that is conducive to living outdoors if we needed to bum it for a while.'' The couple said they intend to remain in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and continue their education. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> said he will pursue his goal of the military reserve and wants to teach, while his wife said she plans to write books. However, <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> called into work Thursday, apologized and quit, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Brookes </PERSON>, manager of <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Court-Four </PERSON>. <PERSON> Swanson </PERSON> also called The Sandwiched Inn and said his wife would n't be working there any more, said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. The Swansons could not be reached immediately for comment about quitting their jobs.

<TEXT>
 Police blamed leftist guerrillas for a power outage that blacked out central <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> hours after President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> demanded tougher laws against terrorism. The outage at 8 p.m. Thursday was the second in less than 24 hours. It plunged <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and cities along 600 miles of coastline into darkness, said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Acedo </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state power company, <PERSON> Electro-Peru </PERSON>. The blackout and an power outage Wednesday night both were blamed on members of the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, <PERSON> Acedo </PERSON> said. He said guerrillas bombed power pylons near <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> on Wednesday and may have done the same thing Thursday. Power on Thursday was restored within 15 minutes in most areas and police said they had no reports of violence. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> vowed Thursday that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> would step up its battle against drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas that defend them. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can count on our decided help. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> will not resign itself to being and exporter of poison,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in his state of the nation address, referring to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s reputation among international anti-drug officials as the world's cocaine cradle. The government said 4,400 people were arrested this week in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> during an operation aimed at preventing guerrilla attacks over the Independence Days, Thursday and today. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said leftist guerrilla violence was <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s major problem and proposed tougher laws to combat it, including penalties against guerrilla leaders who do not participate in attacks and against media that promote and justify subversion. `` The law now favors terrorists ... They are taking advantage of freedom of the press,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in an obvious reference to the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaro </PERSON>, considered the voice of the Shining Path. He disclosed that an eight-year insurgency by the organization had claimed 15,000 lives. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also charged the Shining Path had become `` the armed hand of Peruvian drug traffickers.'' He did not specify what new measures the government would take to fight drugs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials estimate 60 percent of the world's coca, the raw material of cocaine, is harvested illegally in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>

 The weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> reported today that negotiations are under way for the release of the nine <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and nine other foreigners held hostage by Iranian-backed factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The issue of the foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will find its way to a happy ending soon,'' the magazine quoted an unidentified informed security source as saying. `` High-level contacts are under way between officials of the hostages' nations, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and a state that has direct influence on the hostages,'' it said. It quoted the source as saying that no intermediaries were involved. `` A settlement to the hostages' issue will coincide with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential elections'' Nov. 8, the report said. It did not elaborate. The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in return for the release of hostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostages have not proved accurate. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Wednesday his country would be prepared to help get the hostages released if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> released frozen Iranian assets.

 A British soldier who was injured when a bomb exploded in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> stronghold has died, the army said. An army headquarters statement identified the victim as Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, 27. His death Thursday brought the overall death toll to at least 2,663 since sectarian and political violence flared in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in 1969. The army said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was leading a police and army foot patrol on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Cullyhanna </LOCATION> village in southern Armagh Wednesday when a bomb hidden by the side of the road went off. He was wounded in the head and body.

Army experts on Thursday defused a bomb consisting of more than 1,000 pounds of explosives packed into beer kegs hidden in a culvert under the road between <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. The army said it believed the bomb was intended for one of its patrols but that <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas could not detonate it because of a technical malfunction.

 Ten Sinhalese extremists and a soldier were killed and militants torched buses on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at ending Tamil separatist violence, police said today. Most shops, offices and businesses were closed today in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the capital, and its surburbs. Police said people were afraid to open their businesses because of possible violence by Sinhalese radicals opposed to the India-brokered peace accord. A 24-hour curfew went into effect at 6 a.m. today in the island's south after radical Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike. Residents in the northern city of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, about 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said by telephone that Indian soldiers also declared curfews in some areas in the island's north and east until Sunday to prevent attacks by Tamil rebels. The peace accord is opposed both by Tamil rebels fighting for five years for independence in the north and east of the island and by the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist group from the island's majority Sinhalese community. The Sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority, while the Tamils say it does not meet their demands for independence. Military officials said at least 10 Sinhalese extremists were killed by police overnight during a series of unsuccessful attacks on government property in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, strongholds of the <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. A Sinhalese Sri Lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with extremists in <LOCATION> Hambantota </LOCATION> district in the south, police officials said. Ten government-owned buses and two government offices also were set ablaze by the Sinhalese radicals, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Militants launched two unsuccessful attacks on army and police posts in the island's south, but no casualties resulted, the officials said. Electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> were cut Thursday night after Sinhalese extremists blew up electrical transformers, he said. A railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a firebomb as it pulled into <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police said. Only a few government-owned or private buses were seen running. In the island's north, nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers deployed under the peace accord were put on alert after Tamil rebels called for a demonstration to protest the peace pact. On Thursday, 14 Sinhalese farmers were killed by Tamil rebels near <LOCATION> Padaviya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The peace accord, signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on July 29, 1987, calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to minority Tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight for a separate Tamil nation. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> agreed help disarm the Tamil rebels. But violence has persisted in the Tamil areas of the north and east because the main Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, refused to accept the accord. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its own Tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict. Before the peace pact was signed, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> regularly accused <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of training and supplying the rebels. More than 8,000 people have been killed since the ethnic war began in 1983. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up about 75 percent and control the government and the army. More than 400 people have been killed since the accord was signed in attacks blamed on Sinhalese extremists. Most of the victims have been government officials or members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, who signed the accord.

 Retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. `` Ace'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, whose name has surfaced in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract fraud probe, is also the target of two <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> inquiries, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources as confirming that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> is the subject of two inquiries independent of the fraud investigation. One inquiry concerns allegations that classified documents were mishandled, while the other focuses on allegations of misuse of military personnel and government aircraft, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' role in the fraud investigation apparently involves his work as a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which announced Thursday that the former commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> no longer works for them. `` <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> is not under contract with us anymore,'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said Thursday. `` His contract expired ... and we did not renew it.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> declined to comment further on the end of the relationship or the terms of <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' contract, which expired about two weeks ago.

 Two major news organizations say they will appeal a federal judge's ruling holding the lid of secrecy on search warrants in the wide-ranging Pentagon bribery probe. `` I think the decision is clearly wrong,'' <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinke </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ruled against the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Copley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Attorneys for both organizations said they would go to a federal appeals court next week to seek a reversal of the order keeping search warrants and affidavits sealed indefinitely. Another request to unseal documents in the probe was denied in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, on Thursday by U.S. District Judge T.F. <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, ruling against The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper has not decided whether to appeal, said Managing Editor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenner </PERSON>. The investigation, which became public last month, centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information useful in winning multimillion-dollar contracts. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> overturned a federal magistrate's ruling July 15 granting access to the material. The government had argued that release of the documents might prompt targets of the probe to destroy evidence. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who heard arguments from the Times, <LOCATION> Copley </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not wish `` to minimize the importance of the role of the press, especially in matters of extreme public interest such as the investigation concerned herein.'' `` However, the court finds that, on balance, the public's interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at this time,'' he said `` All it says is that the government has concern about possible destruction of evidence,'' said <PERSON> Heinke </PERSON>. `` Anything is possible. There is no showing that it is probable or likely.' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuson </PERSON>, attorney for <LOCATION> Copley </LOCATION>, said the government has a responsibility to allow scrutiny of documents supporting a search. The documents detail searches conducted June 14 at <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and the home of defense consultant <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>. The only segments released so far were introductions showing that wiretaps had been used in each case. News organizations have gone to court in several states to seek access to search warrants and supporting documents on First Amendment grounds. The Courant had sought access to affidavits used to gain search warrants for <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' offices. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, a subsidiary of Hartford-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is suspected of benefiting from inside information to build a battlefield communication system for the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, according to documents already released.

 The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has drafted constitutional guidelines for a multiparty democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in response to criticism that its political programs are too vague, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The guidelines call for an independent judiciary that would enforce constitutional guarantees including freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of association, the Times said. The guidelines resulted from two years of study by an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> committee of lawyers and political scientists, and have circulated only within <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> ranks and to a select group of experts sympathetic to its aim of overthrowing white rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. They are far more specific than the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s 1955 blueprint, known as the Freedom Charter, it said. The guidelines call for a multiparty democracy but ban parties advocating racism or tribalism, and would provide for wide government supervision of the economy to protect the entire population, the Times said. They do not specify whether there would be a president or a prime minister, it said. `` There is a growing acceptance that apartheid can not last,'' <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, 72, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. `` But we think there should be greater clarity and consensus on what a constitution should say.'' The newspaper said the guidelines are a response to criticism by some Western leaders and white liberals in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s political program is too vague. The right to education, to own property, to employment and shelter would be established as ideals, but the difficulty of putting these into practice would be taken into account, the Times said. The guidelines also call for affirmative action to fix the historical imbalances in employment caused by apartheid, and the scrapping of the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts, which set aside 13 percent of the country for blacks, it said. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. The Times said land redistribution would be limited because `` property for personal use and consumption shall be constitutionally protected.''

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> blamed pesky paparazzi and the frustration of living under the media spotlight for a smash-up involving a photographer's car and a Ferrari driven by her boyfriend. The actress' boyfriend, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, 24, also denied he tried to run over the photographer and said he lost control of <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s sports car while swerving into the driveway of her home to duck photographers camped outside. The wreck outside <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s home Wednesday heavily damaged both cars. No one was injured. <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, was arrested and booked for investigation of felony assault with a deadly weapon on free-lance photographer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, 35. In a news conference Thursday closed to most freelance photographers and the tabloid press, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> defended her boyfriend. `` I know <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. He is not a violent man. This is not <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>,'' she said, referring to the pugnacious actor who's had a number of run-ins with photographers She quickly added that <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s husband, is `` the sweetest boy I've ever known'' and that his outbursts also were triggered by intense media scrutiny. `` I never had any intention of ever hurting anyone at any time,'' said <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, who is pursuing an acting career and recently completed shooting of `` Loverboy'' with <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirstie </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. `` He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of speed,'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> said after the accident. `` I was within my rights. I would never do anything illegal.'' <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, both clad in black, went over a litany of grievances they said stemmed from the attention the media has paid to their relationship. Since <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> won an Oscar for her role in `` Moonstruck,'' she said various publications have reported that the couple is planning to marry, that she is pregnant, which she denied, and that she has undergone drastic plastic surgery to maintain her willowy figure and high-cheeked good looks. `` I've been doing this for 25 years, and so I'm pretty much used to having my private life destroyed and lies told about me,'' said <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, who began her career in the 1960s as half of the husband-wife singing duo <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>. `` It's something that you pretty much have to get used to. After a while it really bothers you and disrupts your family life,'' she said. `` I'm usually pretty good about it. I'm getting really, really angry.''

 A <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> man who left his pregnant wife and three children and vanished under mysterious circumstances four years ago has been discovered living in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 40, has since remarried and is living in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> with his new wife and their 15-month-old daughter, authorities said. The Canadian-born <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> planned to fly to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to try to clear up his past. `` I'm going down to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to face the music,'' a tearful <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I've got to clear this up, and then I'm coming directly back here to face the music here.'' On Wednesday, a co-worker at <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> saw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>'s name and picture in a magazine story on missing persons and confronted him <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> faked his own death in 1984, but <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he was suffering a nervous breakdown at the time. He was looking for a way out of his troubled seven-year marriage, he said, and described the events on the day he disappeared as `` a blur.'' `` My head felt like it was in a vice and was going to explode,'' he said. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was reported missing on July 10, 1984 after he failed to return from a fishing trip near <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>. He left behind his wife, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, and their three children, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, 9, <PERSON> Sarah-Anne </PERSON>, 6, and <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON>, 2. Police found <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s locked station wagon and his tackle box near the edge of a river. His fishing pole was found in the water. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schild </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> area sheriff's office said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> may face charges of aggravated non-support for abandoning his wife and children. But he said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s first wife might have had the marriage annulled shortly after he vanished. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who wandered around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> before settling in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> in 1985, said he went back to <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> for one weekend the year he disappeared but no one recognized him. He said he learned his first wife had had their marriage annulled. Confident he was no longer married, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he came to <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> and remarried in 1986.

<HEAD>New Stamps Should Stick Better, Taste Same</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is spending $ 700,000 to come up with a stickier stamp. But do n't expect it to taste any better. `` Taste is a very personal thing. What we've always sought in taste, and where we think we are, is neutral and bland. And we'd like to stay neutral and bland,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morison </PERSON>, a senior assistant postmaster general <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> opened a daylong conference Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> with about 100 adhesive industry executives and technical experts on how to lick the problem of stamps that do n't stay stuck The postal service has a 16-month contract with <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> aimed at persuading the industry to develop a gum that will keep stamps glued to mail zipping through high-speed automated processing equipment. `` Taste is in the tongue of the users, and this contract really has nothing to do with that,'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said. He acknowledged that the postal service regularly gets suggestions about improving the taste of stamps. `` In fact, one other country, I think it was <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, tried some flavored gums at one point in time. But they got so many complaints from the people who did n't like the strawberry or the raspberry flavor,'' he said. `` You ca n't satisfy everybody because we all have different tastes.'' Adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail is sorted manually or mechanically. But the arrival of high-speed, automated processing, in which stamps are coated with a compound that activates processing equipment, requires a stronger adhesive. `` Our letters go through our processing equipment very, very fast. In the time that it takes for a baseball pitcher to throw a ball 90 miles per hour, we probably process 10 letters or so in that fraction of a second, almost,'' he said. `` In doing that, you are again putting a great deal of stress on the stamp.'' <PERSON> Morison </PERSON> said the problem is not acute yet, but some customers have complained about letters that were destroyed or returned because the stamps fell off. `` When you look at the magnitude of the postal service operation, it's very minor because we carry so many pieces of mail every day we have absolutely no problem with,'' he said. `` But when we see something developing, and we see there is an issue here, then in that case we want to fix it, and get it fixed very quickly.''

<HEAD>Officer Writes Bogus Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A traffic cop suspected of writing more than 1,000 bogus tickets in seven years says he did n't have the heart to hand out the real thing. `` I just could not bring myself to write tickets,'' Patrolman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> said Wednesday in an interview. `` I had a conscience. I had a heart. ... I started seeing the human beings behind the drivers' wheels.'' <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> said he began to write one or two bogus tickets a week in the names of motorists who did n't exist about a year and a half ago. However, Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said this week that a computer listing of all the tickets <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON> has written since 1981 shows that more than 1,000 are in the names of people for whom no <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> drivers license could be found. `` We have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious,'' <PERSON> Smalley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>, 36, who has been with the department 17 years, was suspended earlier this month for 25 days. Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> concluded that the officer wrote bogus tickets to maintain `` high enforcement statistics.'' Safety Director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON>, who suspended <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>, said Wednesday he was unaware there may have been more than 1,000 questionable tickets, and Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> said the investigation would be reopened. In a letter to <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> said he considered recommending <PERSON> Ghrist </PERSON>'s firing but decided on leniency because the officer was not motivated by personal profit. For example, he passed up special pay for court appearances.

 An Irish teen-ager who was a stowaway on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer returned home today and was immediately placed under the care of government health officials. Hours before 16-year-old <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Shannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a district court in <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> ordered her placed under the care of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. A spokesman for the health board, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the board made an application for custody `` in the interests of the girl herself and after consultation with her parents and the police.'' He did not elaborate on the reason for the decision or give any indication how long Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> would be under government care. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> has run away from her home in <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, southern <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, several times and was once brought home from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> after disappearing for six months. `` I just want to go home,'' she told Judge <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Morelock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. When Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> landed after an overnight flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she was taken through a rear airport exit away from reporters and placed in a waiting police car. Two agents of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Investigative Service escorted her. An <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> police spokesman, who refused to be named, said her parents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, and her three siblings would see her later. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> apparently slipped aboard the USS Conyngham when it paid a courtesy call in <LOCATION> Cork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. She was discovered aboard the guided missile destroyer Saturday when it returned to its base in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, after a 10-day trip across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The teen-ager apparently spent the entire crossing in a 2 -LCB- - foot wide, 15-foot-long, and 3-foot high compartment above a refrigeration unit Five sailors accused of helping the girl were being held at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> base, authorities said. If charged and convicted, they face a maximum five years in prison and a fine of $ 2,000 dollars for aiding an illegal entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>'s parents said they are considering suing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on grounds that their daughter could not have boarded the ship without help from crew members. `` There is a lot more to this than meets the eye,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> said Thursday. She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had telephoned her in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to apologize.

<TEXT>
 The woman who designed the stark <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War memorial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> etched with the names of the dead in the order they were killed took a similar approach in a monument to the civil rights movement. The monument here will bear the names of about 30 people killed in the battle for racial equality from 1955 to 1968. `` The name is one of the most magical ways to bring back a person,'' said <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's more real than any one image can be.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the 28-year-old designer of the long, black marble wall with the names of thousands of Americans killed in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, on Thursday attended the unveiling of her plans for the civil rights memorial, expected to cost $ 350,000. She said learning about the history behind the names was an important step in designing the memorial. `` Since May I've read four books on it,'' she said. With the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> project, Miss <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> said, she stayed away from books and documentaries about the war while working on her design `` because I did n't want to get into the politics.'' The new memorial will sit in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poverty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Montgomery-based, public-interest law firm specializing in civil rights issues. Construction will begin later this year, with completion scheduled for May 1989. The project will be built with by proceeds from the recent sale of property adjacent to law center. Ms. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>'s design calls for an upper plaza with a quiet pool and water that cascades down the face of a curved, black wall 40 feet long. Inscribed in gold leaf on the wall will be a section of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` I Have a Dream Speech,'' saying: `` We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.'' In a lower plaza, a circular stone table 12 feet in diameter will be inscribed with the names of people killed during the civil rights movement. Water emerging from the center of the table will flow evenly across its surface. The memorial will begin with the 1955 slaying of <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Till </PERSON> in Money, Miss. Till, a black man, was lynched after saying `` Bye, baby,'' to a white woman. The historical review will end April 4, 1968, the day King was assassinated in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Also listed will be <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official gunned down in front of his home in 1963; four children killed in 1963 in the bombing of a Baptist church in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, and three civil rights activists shot to death in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, during the Freedom Summer of 1964

<TEXT>
 Two members of the rival Bloods and Crips gangs clasped hands after three days of talks that were pronounced a success by organizers despite the failure to produce an agreement to stop the bloodshed. Gang experts and civic leaders, however, were skeptical of whether the talks were worthwhile. `` They'll go back into their gangs and they'll talk with their gang members and convince them to lay down their weapons,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who set up the talks between 12 gang members in this <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> and gang members present said the talks that ended Thursday were beneficial, despite the lack of an agreement to end the gang fighting, which has claimed more than 165 lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> this year. `` We want to live, man. We do n't want to die. But we do n't have nothing else to do,'' said a Bloods member who called himself Twilight. Twilight clasped hands with a member of the Crips who called himself Twelve. The Los Angeles chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> had withdrawn support for the talks. And although she supported the idea of talking versus shooting, state Sen. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said gang members should not be `` treated like ambassadors from warring nations.'' <PERSON> Mims </PERSON> acknowledged the gang members participating are not leaders of gangs, although he said they hold influence with their groups. Police estimate gang membership in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> at 100,000. Gang members belong to hundreds of `` sets'' that are loosely aligned as Crips, Bloods or dozens of other smaller gangs.

<HEAD>Students Protest at Shwedagon Pagoda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students shouted slogans and plastered posters with anti-government phrases on <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s holiest <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> shrine today following changes that brought to power a political hardliner. Burmese returning from worship at the gold-laden <ORGANIZATION> Shwedagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pagoda </ORGANIZATION> said a small number of students stood atop water tanks at the shrine Thursday evening, gave anti-government speeches and shouted slogans. The students returned before noon today, but there were no reports of violence or confrontation with authorities. Some commotion erupted on the crowded pagoda grounds Thursday when pilgrims dispersed in panic following a fight between some youths. No injuries were reported. The Shwedagon Pagoda, in the northern suburbs of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, has been a traditional gathering place for political dissenters, including those who fought British colonialism. Last month, authorities surrounded and briefly closed the pagoda after students set up a `` strike center'' designed to coordinate anti-government protest. The students entered the pagoda precincts following a week of rioting in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Official accounts said nine people died in the rioting. Following the June unrest which spread to other <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> cities and towns, the government closed virtually all universities. They are scheduled to reopen next month. Students also have been spreading leaflets in the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> capital denouncing <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who was elected both president and chairman of the ruling political party. He succeeded Ne Win, who wielded power for 26 years. According to Western and <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> sources, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> commanded riot police who brutally put down student demonstrations here last March. With a long record of harsh action against dissenters, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s elevation to the country's most powerful positions is likely to spark more unrest. Since October, violent, student-led demonstrations have erupted three times. In addition to demands for greater freedom within the military-controlled state, protesters are demanding better economic conditions in this once prosperous country. Western diplomats are watching how students will act after classes resume. On Saturday, Ne Win warned that if the army is called out to suppress protets it would shoot `` to hit'' rather than just scare. The small, Shwedagon demonstration was the first known public protest in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> since the leadership changes. A curfew remained in effect in the town of <LOCATION> Myede </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, after mobs destroyed buildings and clashed with police Tuesday. Officials said one person was killed and five wounded. It was not clear whether that unrest was politically related. It appeared to have been sparked by strife between Moslems and Buddhists, who are the majority in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A number of outbursts in recent months started as minor personal or ethnic quarrels and escalated into anti-government riots.

 Soviet media today indicated that a crackdown has begun against those agitating for Armenian control of a disputed region in a neighboring republic. The labor newspaper <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said 44 people face criminal charges in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, following an incident in which Armenian activists attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city. The newspaper did not indicate the date or the size of the demonstration. It said 155 drivers had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined, indicating a sizeable turnout. The protest involved Aremenians' demand for control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is an Armenian-dominated area. Most Armenians are Christians, and most Azerbaijanis are Moslems. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> began in February. This month, Armenian officials voted to annex the disputed region, but <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> leaders refused. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on July 18 deemed that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> should remain part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure that order was restored in the area. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported today that the situation was stabilizing in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but it said that at `` the urging of instigators,'' some strikes and protests continued. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said party and government leaders in the regions involved had been penalized for failing to take appropriate action against those organizing the unrest. It praised the `` vigorous stand'' taken against continued activism.

 The chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate to the stalled <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference said today the meeting `` still has a long way to go,'' despite some progress in the human rights field by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies. The conference of Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> had been tentatively scheduled to end today, but delegates say it is likely to continue into the fall. Despite `` some fairly substantial progress in a number of countries, including, of course, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, there is still a long way to go'' to reach agreement on a final document, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief delegate <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said that in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, prisoners of conscience and activists were in labor camps or forced exile `` because of things they have thought or things they have said.'' `` I think time is long past when that kind of violation should continue,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said, adding that some Western radio broadcasts, including Israeli and West German radio programs for Soviet listeners, are still jammed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting, attended by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European states except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, began in November 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords on military security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, economic cooperation and humanitarian issues, including human rights. The delegates have been deadlocked over a final document. Western delegates say the document should advance the provisions contained in the 1975 accords and documents concluded at previous follow-up meetings. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> singled for criticism a Romanian government project to raze 7,000 villages in a nationwide resettlement plan that critics say will destroy the traditional life of ethnic Hungarians. In <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said, the 900,000-strong Turkish minority was still being deprived of its ethnic rights. In May, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s nine neutral and non-aligned countries introduced a draft compromise document designed to help East and West reach a successful conclusion, but Western diplomats say disagreement persists in the human rights area. `` We still have to get good agreement on such important issues as freedom of religion, ... rights of national minorities and the right of radio broadcasts to enter freely,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. `` Until we get an agreement on these issues, it's hard to see how we can end this meeting.''

<HEAD>Judge: DeSillers Would Be `Unjustly Enriched' By Sons Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Money donated for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' three liver transplants will be used to pay medical bills, debts and help other children in need of transplants _ and not a penny will go to the boy's mother, a judge ruled. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has been accused of misusing some of $ 689,000 in donations that poured in before her 7-year-old son died awaiting a fourth transplant at a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital in 1987. The donations included $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> on Thursday refused to give Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> and her former husband, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON>, any claim to the remaining $ 243,500. He said to do so would be `` erroneous and a judicial absurdity.'' `` To allow the contributions donated by caring and affected <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to ... descend to <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s parents ... would unjustly enrich persons not entitled to the same,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> wrote. The judge ordered that money in the boy's estate be used to pay hospital bills and other debts, with any remaining money going to other needy ill children. Court-appointed curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, ordered to oversee the money, hailed the decision. `` I think that this should reassure people who gave money that it'll be used for the purpose intended,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said she will try to recoup some of the $ 200,000 Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> allegedly gave to friends and relatives or spent on such items as jewelry and a BMW sports car. `` There were things done by people that should not have been done. If they are substantial, we'll litigate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. `` We'll be looking at each and every person who received the funds.'' The curator charges that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> paid herself $ 96,526 from donations, $ 23,700 to her boyfriend, $ 13,500 for the <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, $ 10,850 in jewelry, $ 6,000 in rent for her high-rise bayfront apartment and $ 8,000 in clothing and furniture. Only $ 44,359 was spent on other children who required transplants, Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said. A teary-eyed Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' refused to speak with reporters and did not return a telephone call. Her attorney, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, said the decision would be appealed. `` <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> had a dream that she wanted to realize, and now that dream can not come true,'' he said. Mrs. DeSillers is under investigation by the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state attorney's office and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attorney general's office, which are trying to determine whether she misused any of donations. DeSillers has denied misusing the money and said about $ 150,000 was sent to her directly but had been mistakenly mingled in her son's account.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> plant and campaigned among <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> today while continuing to woo supporters of former rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I do n't care who you were with in the primary, you're all Democrats,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a crowd of about 500 people when he arrived at the Flint airport Thursday night. `` We're going to win the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and win it decisively,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who lost this state's primary to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> before running off a string of victories that secured the nomination. Today, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got a tour of the GM plant, ending it by driving a new <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blazer </ORGANIZATION> off the assembly line before meeting with the union workers. From <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> Racine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, to visit a minority-owned technology company that has established retraining programs for its workers. He arrived here after campaign stops in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, taking time at both places to depart from his standard pledge of `` good jobs at good wages'' to step up his attack on the ethical standards of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ particularly their support of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> even after two top <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> aides quit because of his legal troubles. `` In a <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the ethics office will be in the Oval Office, not some place down the hall,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a swipe at the handling of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s troubles and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for an ethics office in the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took time in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to meet with prominent <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, including <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>. Also at the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> meeting was <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign manager. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deputy field director <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide four years ago, described the sessions as `` very positive'' and said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, nearly all black, had pledged their support to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers were `` very enthused and ready to go to work.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON>, after a meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, said: `` Now we are ready to support <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ he won.'' Fingering a campaign button on his lapel, <PERSON> James </PERSON> added: `` I have now replaced my <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> button with a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> button. We're ready to win.'' In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, during a series of live and satellite television interviews, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faced questioning about his selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate instead of the home state favorite there, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. `` In the end, I just felt that Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was the right choice,'' he said. He also interrupted his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaigning to speak via satellite to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, promising that if elected he would appoint members to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> sensitive to labor needs. In that speech and his addresses to rallies in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated many of the themes of the speech he gave when he accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We can take the easy road, the downhill road, or we can put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the path to greatness once again,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the union conference. At each stop he repeated his support for an increased minimum wage, universal health care and a trade bill containing a provision providing advance notification for workers of plant closings. And he said that despite economic growth during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, that prosperity has reached only the `` privileged few.'' He predicted he would defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in November because average Americans are concerned about the country's economic future. `` You can not build a strong economic future on a credit card,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` We can not continue to borrow and spend and borrow and spend to prosperity.'' After the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> stop, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was headed to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. He was to spend tonight in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and attend events there and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Saturday before returning home.

 Firefighters raced the wind today in an attempt to beat back a forest fire that raged out of control after destroying 15 homes on the city's edge. Officials offered a $ 10,000 reward in the suspected arson. Winds dropped to 5 mph early this morning, prompting a major assault to take advantage of the lull and cooler temperatures. The weather service said the wind was expected to pick up again, reaching 15 to 25 mph by afternoon. But higher humidity _ a boon to firefighting _ also was expected and crews said they hoped to complete a fire line around the 3,000-acre blaze by early Saturday, a spokesman said today. The fire was considered 80 percent contained. `` It's looking a lot more positive than it has,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, fire information officer. It's the first time since the fire started Tuesday that firefighters have estimated when they might get a handle on the blaze. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, fire crews in Yellowstone National Park today took the calculated risk of lighting `` burnouts'' _ igniting dead timber and brush in an attempt to keep isolated blazes from combining into bigger fires. Fires fed by drought-dried fields and forests also blackened regions of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 15 homes and 32 outbuildings had been destroyed and 2,800 acres burned by Thursday evening. `` They're going to have trouble holding the lines on the south and southeast,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Thursday night. `` My gosh, I wish it would rain.'' Earlier Thursday, officials evacuated hundreds more homes in three subdivisions on the west side. On Thursday evening they suggested that people leave another large rural area. Two subdivisions remained evacuated today. Police Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennies </PERSON> said he had received no reports of looting in the hundreds of homes left vacant. Volunteer firefighters saved 100 houses on Thursday, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. Small fire departments from around the state have brought in 65 engines to pump water onto houses to keep them from igniting while the fire burns around them. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> offered the $ 10,000 reward in the suspected arson. He said the state and businesses had put up the money. A 14-year-old boy was arrested in connection with a small fire, but police said they did not think he was responsible for setting the main fire on Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, officials acknowledged the risk of burnouts. `` But we'd rather burn this out under the best conditions we can control instead of letting the fire run in on us uncontrolled,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggeman </PERSON>, a fire official at the Shoshone blaze near <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. An update Thursday night by infrared mapping showed the number of acres on fire down from 95,000 to about 93,000 in the 2.2 million acre park. The forecast for today called for ideal burning conditions _ good for the wildfires and encouraging for the burnouts _ with high temperatures of 75-85 degrees and relative humidities of 15 percent to 22 percent. A burnout is meant to destroy fallen trees, snags and brush in a controlled manner to rob a fire of fuel to advance. In the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire, fire crews carrying hand-held drip torches ignited brush and fallen trees Thursday, moving fast to avoid the flare-up as the tinder-dry wood was torched. Meanwhile, heli-torches _ flame throwers on choppers _ continued setting burnouts on the northeast flank of the 8,500-acre fire that is threatening Old Faithful and the huge complex that surrounds the famous geyser. `` We're happy with the burnout so far,'' said fire spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` Once we get the northeast head of the fire dealt with, it can go north, away from Old Faithful.'' About 50 people forced from their houses by the marauding 900-acre Madison Gulch timber fire in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were expected to return to their homes today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, firefighters were battling only 16 of 51 wind-whipped fires. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> said summer fires have blackened 1.4 million acres in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Ten families remained evacuated from their homes near the 3,000-acre <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> fire northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, as the state imposed strict fire restrictions on government land throughout the dry southern part of the state. Hundreds of firefighters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state continued to battle a stubborn 3,600-acre forest fire that consumed old-growth timber and logging trees in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, firefighters were working on scores of small fires throughout the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> range, most of them caused by lightning. But a fire that burned about 30 acres Wednesday near <LOCATION> Coulterville </LOCATION>, destroying four structures and forcing the evacuation of up to 70 homes, was blamed on a careless 13-year-old smoker. Near <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, firefighters from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> joined today to help fight a fire that has burned about 350 acres at the <ORGANIZATION> Chequamegaon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, officials said.

<HEAD>Government Sets Aug. 22 For Start Of Afternoon Pub Drinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what promises to be a minor revolution in national drinking habits, the government has said pubs will be allowed to stay open all afternoon beginning Aug. 22. The move, the first major change in pub licensing laws in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in 72 years, was announced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday by Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>. The change does not apply to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where pubs have been open during the afternoons since 1977 under separate licensing laws. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation approving the relaxation of licensing regulations in April but left it to the government to decide the date when pubs could start opening in the afternoon. Since 1916, pubs in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> have had to shut down after lunch and not open again until early evening. The 1916 law was introduced to curb drinking by World War I munitions workers. Under the new law, introduced largely as a result of pressure from the tourism industry, pubs will be allowed to stay open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m on weekdays. Currently, weekday hours are 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and in most cases 5:30 or 6 p.m to 11 p.m. The change does not affect Sunday pub hours, which run noon until 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. The Consumers' Association and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> are among those who welcomed the relaxation of restrictions on drinking hours. But the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said it fears an upsurge in alcohol-related illness and road accidents.

<HEAD>Three Charged with Murder and Terrorism for Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two white Zimbabweans and a black former policeman were indicted today on charges of murder, terrorism and sabotage for a car-bomb attack on guerrillas fighting the South African government. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 35, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Conjwayo </PERSON>, 54, are accused of being South African agents. They were arrested after a car bomb demolished part of a house occupied by officials of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> on Jan. 11. Some occupants of the house were injured. The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla group fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government. In a brief hearing at the Chikurubi maximum-security prison near <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, prosecutor <PERSON> Yunus </PERSON> <PERSON> Omerjee </PERSON> said the murder charges related to the death of <PERSON> Obert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwanza </PERSON>, the driver of the car. <LOCATION> Mwanza </LOCATION> apparently was hired to drive the car and did not know it was booby-trapped. In the hearing, the state alleged that <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Conjwayo </PERSON>, acting as agents for <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, carried out the car-bombing and other acts of terrorism and sabotage punishable by death or life imprisonment under <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> laws. Fourteen whites and three blacks are awaiting trial on capital charges for attacks on <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> is a former officer in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s central intelligence organization. <PERSON> Conjwayo </PERSON> served as a special branch police officer before white-ruled <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> became black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> in 1980. The three were ordered to appear in court October 12.

<HEAD>Senate Ends Impasse Over Endangered Species Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is getting ready to complete work on strengthening the Endangered Species Act, the worldwide standard for protecting plants and animals, after a four-year impasse was finally broken in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The way was cleared Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 93-2 for bipartisan legislation that would give the 15-year-old protection program more money and greater powers. The action capped four years of efforts by the bill's managers to bring the package to a floor vote. Until recently, they had been blocked by a handful of senators questioning efforts to protect sea turtles and reintroduce wolves to Yellowstone National Park. Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> now must meet to resolve relatively minor differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bill and one passed 399-16 by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last December. Technically, the endangered species program has been without legislative authorization since Oct. 1, 1985. The protection effort has been financed year by year since then, with some $ 39 million available this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would authorize $ 56 million next year, rising to $ 66 million in 1992. The basic law, enacted in 1973, prohibits trade in species considered endangered or threatened and requires the government to take affirmative steps to foster their survival and take no actions that would hasten their demise. There are now nearly 1,000 species on the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s endangered-threatened list, about 400 of them found in this country. There are about 1,000 species awaiting formal listing. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, floor manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, said that at current spending levels it would take until 2020 to end this backlog. Environmentalists say some 80 species have become extinct while awaiting listing and that another 300 may have passed the point of no return. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would require more intensive monitoring of the condition of species awaiting listing. Both bills would increase the civil and criminal penalties for violations of the protection law and attempt to close a loophole that has allowed the destruction of endangered plants on private property. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, said that conservationists worldwide were watching the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law is `` a model for the entire world.'' `` One of these rare species may hold the cure to cancer,'' he said. `` The extinction of a single species can be an act of the utmost recklessness. ... Extinction is an awesome act of finality.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> called the plan `` a strong statement to our continuing commitment to protect these plants and animals on the brink of extinction.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a renewal bill in 1985, but it died because a handful of Westerners were able to keep the issue off the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. This year, Western opposition, centering on water rights and control of predators like wolves and grizzly bears, was muted. But Southern lawmakers convinced <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to accept language that would delay the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to force shrimp fishermen to use devices to prevent dwindling numbers of sea turtles from being snared and drowned in their nets. Under the amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., turtle excluder devices would not be required in offshore waters before next May or in inshore waters before May 1990 In the interim, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> would study factors affecting turtle mortality in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> of the Defenders of Wildlife said species-protection groups could live with the amendment, which set up easy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of the bill. `` We're confident the study will confirm that these turtles are highly endangered and that the devices are necessary,'' he said. The only `` no'' votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were cast by Republicans <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>.

 Unless the scales of justice tip in his favor in the next few days, an 800-pound man unable to get out of bed will be evicted from his home, hoisted by a forklift and hauled off on a flatbed trailer. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, who fell out of bed in December and needed a tow truck to get up, lost an appeal of the eviction Thursday. His landlord, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fish </PERSON>, wants to level the dilapidated bungalow where <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has lived with his mother for two years in order to redevelop the land for single-family homes in this suburb north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, says he'll fight any attempt to use a forklift to remove his client. He said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> could be removed as early as next week. `` My understanding is that if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is touched and if they try to move him, his health would be jeopardized,'' <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said. `` We're putting the county and police on notice that to touch him would jeopardize his health.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Seltman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the county probably will seek an independent physician's opinion before removing <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. The county concluded earlier that the best way to remove him would be to hoist him by forklift onto a Highway Department flatbed truck. `` If this could hurt him, we'll ask a judge what to do,'' <PERSON> Seltman </PERSON> said. Real estate agents have failed to find a place for the pair to live because of <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s size. The county also has unsuccessfully sought land for a trailer his landlord was willing to give him. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, 24, has been accepted into an obesity program at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but said he does n't want to go because the program wo n't accept his mother, who weighs about 400 pounds.

 Treasures hoarded by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emperors for more than 2,000 years go on display here today, with jewels, terra cotta warriors, a golden dragon throne and jade burial costume rivaling the splendors of King Tut. More than 90 percent of the 221 artifacts on loan from the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the Son of Heaven exhibit have never been seen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and 80 percent have never left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, officials said. `` Through it, all Americans will come to know <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as few in the world ever have,'' former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said in a letter to his brother <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, that was shared with Chinese officials. The scope and quality of the exhibits are the greatest ever lent by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, according to <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chengsheng </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Ministry of Culture <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, who normalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the early 1970s, wanted to attend today's opening but could n't for health reasons, said <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a local group that helped organize the exhibit. The 74-year-old former president, who lives in <LOCATION> Saddle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had prostate surgery last month. The exhibit, which promoters say is four times larger than the King Tut show that thrilled <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a decade ago, was created largely from archaeological discoveries and research in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the Communists took power in 1949. Its treasures come from 21 museums and institutions in eight provinces and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, coming soon after the success of the Academy Award-winning movie `` The Last Emperor,'' is expected to draw more than a million people before closing Dec. 31. It will move to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, for a March-September run before returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The objects in this exhibition reflect the special traits of Chinese art as well as the high level of archaeological discoveries and research in contemporary <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Xie </PERSON> said here earlier this summer. `` By sharing them, we hope to strengthen the bonds of mutual friendship and understanding between our two countries,'' said <PERSON> Xie </PERSON>, who led a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> that selected <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> for the two-city tour. Preview glimpses of the exhibit were offered Thursday. It consists of a video show on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s imperial history and five galleries illustrating the emperor's ritual, public and private life, his role in Chinese religious teachings and his belief in an afterlife. The emperor of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was considered the son of heaven, and was believed to own and control everything under heaven. Like high officials of 18th century <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, visitors approach a dragon throne of gold, silk and lacquer, with peacock feathers above and an intricate carpet beneath that represents imperial <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in a time of great strength. While not arranged chronologically, the exhibit illustrates how emperors lived and ruled over 26 centuries from 221 B.C. until 1911. Among the treasures are a set of 26 bells from the 6th century B.C., robes only the emperor could wear, paintings, jewelry, household items, and a 2nd century jade burial suit believed to possess magical properties to preserve the body of the princess placed inside it for eternity. The life-size terra cotta figures, four warriors and two horses, were selected from thousands found near the famed tomb of <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shihuang </PERSON> Di in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in 1974. The exhibit was planned over nearly four years by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhibition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION>, and Son of <ORGANIZATION> Heaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The idea for the show came from <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Pufang </PERSON>, son of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who passed it to <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallery </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. West arranged for private sponsorhip of the exhibit. General admission to the show is $ 7.50. The proceeds will benefit Chinese archaeology and other causes.

<HEAD>Four Cling To Rocks Above Horseshoe Falls Before Rescue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Workers formed a human chain and waded into the <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rapids to rescue four people who clung to rocks 40 feet above the falls for about an hour after their boat capsized, authorities said. The four began drinking on the 26-foot boat Wednesday evening at a marina in <LOCATION> Chippawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, and were unaware they had drifted so close to Horseshoe Falls, the celebrated 158-foot drop on the Canadian side of the border, authorities said. No one was steering, said Sgt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dugos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Niagara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm very much surprised that all four people were saved,'' he said. The four abandoned the boat when it capsized 40 yards from the brink of the falls and were rescued early Thursday, suffering only bumps and scrapes. The $ 130,000 boat was swept over the falls and destroyed. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shand </PERSON>, 34, said he thought he and his companions would die as they clasped the rocks with the roar of the falls in their ears. `` You had to be out there,'' said the owner of the boat, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, 35. `` It's like something you dream about in the middle of the night.'' A camper in <LOCATION> Goat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> heard the four screaming and called for help. Warning signs and the rapids of the upper <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> usually discourage boaters from getting too close to the falls. No charges have been filed against the four, all residents of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>.

 A royal snafu has erupted over a dry cleaner's insistence on using the nickname she has had since childhood: Lady Di. The British government frowns on anyone taking the royal family's names in vain, including <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, wife of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, and twice has asked <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Storoni </PERSON> to rename her establishment in <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>, about 45 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` It's my name and I'm not going to change it for anybody,'' said <PERSON> Storoni </PERSON>, who says her family has called her Lady Di since she was a baby. `` That's that. I, personally, do n't think she -LRB- the Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> -RRB- cares about this.'' <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON>, spokesman at the British consulate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the names of members of the royal family are `` never used in commercial solicitation either in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or anywhere in the world.'' He also does n't like the way <PERSON> Storoni </PERSON> advertises her company as `` Cleaners to the Royal Family.'' The radio commercial features an impersonation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The advertisement `` cheapens not only the royal family themselves, but also the humanitarian values with which they are so closely associated around the world,'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> wrote in a June 14 letter. <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said the consulate has received several letters from local residents offended by the ads. He said a British company can advertise that it provides goods or services to the royal family only if designated `` by appointment to the royal family.'' `` We simply wanted to make the company aware of all of that,'' he said, `` and it's really up to the company to decide what they want to do. We certainly do n't intend to take it any further.'' But <PERSON> Storoni </PERSON> does. She wants to open a Lady Di plant in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next year. And for anyone who is offended, her business partner, <PERSON> Gennaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>, said, `` Perhaps you might suggest a little less starch in their laundry.''

<HEAD>Jackson's Secret Service Protection Extended One Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a 30-day extension of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, at a cost of roughly $ 600,000, because of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s concerns regarding threats against his life, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman said today. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president would not approve extension of the protection through the fall election campaign. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision authorized an extension from the day after the Democratic National Convention concluded to Aug. 22. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s request for an extension was `` based on his assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an active participant'' in the campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection technically was to have been withdrawn on July 22, after his presidential candidacy ended with the Democratic nomination of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the protection had been maintained without interruption while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> weighed whether to approve the extension. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the 30-day extension would give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a transition period in which to arrange for private bodyguards. `` The feeling was that, first of all, he's not the nominee of the party,'' the spokesman said. However, he said there had been precedents for extending normal Secret Service protection for government officials because of extenuating circumstances.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> courted blue-collar voters and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters today in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, a state that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won during the primary season, as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made another push for his child-care plan and continued his search for a running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was on a solo voyage for the Democratic ticket, wooing independent-minded Westerners whose suspicion of big government previously drew them to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a 30-day extension of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, at a cost that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman estimated at $ 600,000. He said the protection would end Aug. 22. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s request was `` based on his assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an active participant'' in the campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a General Motors plant in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, driving a <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blazer </ORGANIZATION> off the assembly line, and then spoke to several hundred <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, many of them laid off from other plants, outside their union hall. He said full employment would be his No. 1 priority as president, and he told the autoworkers that something must be done about the hard times that have lingered in parts of the nation as the economy has recovered on both coasts. `` If there's one thing I want to do as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it's to bring those kind of jobs and that kind of future to every community in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` You need a president who will work with you, a president who wo n't settle for second-best or second-rate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters today that he expects to select a running mate before the Republican National Convention next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oreleans </LOCATION> but `` I will keep my own counsel'' on the selection. While saying that his choice for the No. 2 spot on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket was important, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I really believe the election will be decided at the presidential level.'' Asked whether there were any prospective running mates left to be contacted by him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Maybe.'' The vice president spoke with reporters as he toured a company-sponsored child care center in <LOCATION> Tysons </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Corner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has proposed a $ 1,000-per-child tax credit primarily aimed at low-income working mothers, voiced opposition to a $ 2.5 billion Democratic child care plan that gives the federal government a more direct role. `` I am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse that the federal government alone can not have a bricks-and-mortar child care program that's going to be effective. You have to have choice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to have diversity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who lost <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> but went on to secure the nomination with a string of primary victories, said to a crowd of about 500 people when he arrived in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> Thursday night, `` I do n't care who you were with in the primary, you're all Democrats. Also in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had declined an invitation to address next week's league conference. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will appear before the group Monday night and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will speak Wednesday. As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, the vice president says he hopes to have a tentative list completed by week's end, but plans to delay his final selection until the Republican National Convention on Aug. 15-18. `` The process is going along in an orderly fashion,'' he said Thursday. Those reached include former rivals Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and several whose names did not figure in earlier speculation. Among those are Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind.. Campaign sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list to date also includes Sens <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>.; Govs <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; and former Govs. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, who recently was nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be attorney general. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in a speech Thursday in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislators </ORGANIZATION>, `` If there is one lesson we have learned in recent years, it is that the federal government ca n't solve all of the -LRB- nation's -RRB- problems. Mindful of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' promise of an activist government, he added, `` But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can lead.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, no longer a presidential candidate, returned to his brand of diplomacy, saying he has asked the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general to ask Iranian officials for assistance in freeing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held by Iranian sympathizers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was unfamiliar with the facts about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s effort, `` but as a general matter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' post-convention high in the polls continued Thursday, as a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll gave him an 18-point lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said such a wide margin was likely to be temporary. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' survey of 1,268 likely voters found 57 percent support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to 39 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It was the fourth national poll since the Democratic convention last week to find a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead of that magnitude. The new <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll was done July 22-25 and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

 Playboy Bunnies in cotton-tail costumes will dip their last bunny dips tonight when the last <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> closes. The Hilton Inn dropped its <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> franchise to `` create a new image'' for the lounge connected to its hotel. `` It sometimes discourages group meeting planners from selecting the Lansing hotel,'' sales director <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlers </PERSON> said. The club, which opened in 1982, was the last holdout in a 28-year tradition. Franchises in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> closed at the end of April, while <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shut down all the clubs it owned in 1986. Nearly 30 <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION> sprang up around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> opened the first in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1960. Every club followed the <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> formula: waitresses served drinks while perched on spike heels and squeezed into figure-hugging, strapless, low-cut satin costumes accessorized with tuxedo collars, cuffs, fluffy white tails and bunny ears. Playboy bunnies were trained to serve drinks by `` dipping'' demurely rather than bending over. When he closed the Playboy-owned clubs, <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said they had become `` passe'' and `` too tame for the times.'' After tonight, anyone interested in patronizing a <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> will have to go to the Orient. The Lansing club had a reunion Thursday of all the Playboy bunnies who ever served cocktails there. Tonight, a reunion is planned for the people who were card-carrying club members before low attendance forced the owners to throw away the key cards and let anyone in. `` Business has been so slow,'' club Manager <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Collar </PERSON> said. On Saturday, club memorabilia will be auctioned for charity. The closing, announced earlier this month, gave both the club and hotel a boost as former customers, curiosity seekers and reporters descended to witness the end of an era. `` The bunnies are getting pretty good at interviews,'' Collar said.

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said today the nation should mobilize resources to fight tobacco addiction as it has to fight illicit drugs. `` We should give tobacco use and tobacco addiction the serious attention it deserves,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` Our nation has mobilized enormous resources to wage a war on drugs _ illicit drugs. `` We should also give priority to the one addiction _ tobacco addiction _ that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each year,'' he said. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment on a 618-page report he issued in May in which he said, `` Careful examination of the data makes it clear that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. `` Moreover, the processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` To call smoking an ` addiction' trivializes, and almost mocks, the serious narcotic and other hard drug problems faced by our society and undermines efforts to combat drug abuse.'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> proclaimed in 1982 that young people are addicted to video games. `` The escalation of antismoking rhetoric by the surgeon general in his latest report is similarly without medical or scientific foundation _ as a number of public health officials have recognized, and as the 41 million Americans who have topped smoking attest,'' he said. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that more than 2,000 scientific articles were reviewed in preparing the report. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the panel that tobacco, like other addictions, can be treated effectively. `` A wide variety of behavorial interventions have been used for years,'' he said. `` In recognition of the important role that nicotine plays in maintaining tobacco use, nicotine replacement therapy is now available. `` Nicotine gum has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms following smoking cessation, and may enhance the effectiveness of behaviorial treatments,'' he said. National surveys indicate that 75 percent to 85 percent of smokers would like to quit, he said. `` More than 40 million Americans have been able to quit smoking, despite the addiction,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the subcommittee. `` For many smokers, a genuine desire to quit and, if necessary, persistent and repeated attempts to quit may be all that is necessary. For others, self-help materials, formal treatment programs and nicotine replacement therapy may be needed.'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s report `` is a political document.'' `` Its conclusions conform with the surgeon general's political goal of a smokeless society, and undoubtedly were reached long before the report was drafted,'' he told the committee. `` By branding cigarette smoking an ` addiction' - a term with deeply pejorative moral and social connotations _ the Surgeon General obviously hopes to strengthen the antismoking cause generally and, by his own admissions, hopes to make it easier for plaintiffs to prevail in tobacco product liability cases.''

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today urged the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership to reform the government to broaden personal freedoms and make it more responsive. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a plenary meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened today on `` practical work to implement the decisions of the 19th All-Union Conference'' of the party, which called this month for reform. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s information department confirmed shortly after 6 p.m. that the meeting had finished its work, but declined to say what orders the policy-making body issued or whether any changes were made to the ruling 13-man Politburo. `` You will have to wait for the official announcements,'' said the committee spokesman. He spoke on condition he not be identified. Western and Soviet sources had predicted that at least one long-standing member of the leadership would tender his resignation at the gathering, perhaps setting a precedent for orderly retirement from the ruling body where members have traditionally served for life or been voted out in disgrace. The Politburo decided July 4 to call together the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s more than 300 members. It said then it was preparing proposals for the committee on implementing `` reforms of the political system, the democratization of party, state and social life.'' Resolutions on major changes in Soviet government institutions and internal party practices were adopted by a 5,000-delegate national party conference that met in the Kremlin June 28-July 1. Revamped institutions of central government are to be in place by next spring, the conference said. The party also has been ordered to review the qualifications of each of its 20 million members this year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the party's general secretary, says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must transform itself into a country ruled by law to prevent a lapse into the repression of the Stalin years and the corruption and stagnation allowed under President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The conference resolutions call for broad and varied changes ranging from an end to bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to a declaration that citizens should have access to all information not classified as military or state secrets. The conference also ordered the party to get out of the business of running the economy and government administration and to concentrate on setting the ideological agenda of the nation's 284 million citizens. But the documents adopted unanimously by the delegates usually speak only in general terms of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s goals for political reform. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to flesh them out and come up with a specific timetable and methods to implement them. The committee also is empowered to make changes in the Politburo and the Secretariat, the top party body that runs the country's day-to-day affairs, but no reshuffling of the top <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership is expected The last <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum, on May 23, did not make any personnel changes. But at its previous session, on Feb. 17-18, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> removed former <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> from his non-voting seat on the Politburo. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had been fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader in November. The plenum also might shed light on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal for a powerful new presidency. The post apparently is designed for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself, whose job as party chief now makes him the No. 1 figure in the collective <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. The Soviet presidency, held by former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, now is a largely ceremonial post. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked that the office also include control over domestic, international and defense policies. But there was no mention of those powers in the official documents adopted by the party conference.

 A <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant has lifted its nighttime ban on customers under 16, says a lawyer for a 13-year-old who sued over the policy. The age-discrimination suit, filed by attorney <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, alleged that <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellez </PERSON> was told to leave the <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> restaurant halfway through her meal Jan. 22 under a policy aimed at curbing teen-age vandalism. `` I'm glad this is settled because I think teen-agers should be treated equally,'' the girl said as she ate a McDonald's cheeseburger in <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>'s office Thursday A spokesman for the restaurant said the policy against youngsters after 9 p.m. had already been rescinded when the suit was filed March 15. The policy was initiated earlier this year after Friday night crowds tore out chairs and defaced table tops with graffiti, employees said.

<HEAD>U.S.,Greece Conclude Eighth Round of Base Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Greek and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators today wrapped up an eighth round of talks on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases agreement to replace an accord that expires in December. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said the negotiations were held in a `` professional atmosphere'' but added that there `` continued to be a difference of views on the issues being discussed.'' Negotiations for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base agreement are moving more slowly than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would like. On July 13, the government issued a formal shut-down notice for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases operating in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The notice, a legal formality, is not expected to result in any of the bases being closed. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> insists that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should help solve Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> and the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in return for a new base agreement. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't want to link a new accord with regional politics. <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> described as `` completely inaccurate'' a report in <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Weekly that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base facilites in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> would be transferred to <LOCATION> Souda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. According to the report, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to remove the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base from <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and transfer it to <LOCATION> Souda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> as part of an `` alternative solution.'' Since the 1950s, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has operated four military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> _ two near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and two on the southern island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. As a form of rent for the bases, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> receives more than $ 300 million yearly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military credits. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who came to power in 1981 pledging to shut down the American bases, now says his socialist government is willing to sign a new agreement, provided it is first approved in a referendum. Further negotiations are scheduled for September in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Police today ordered the film `` Cry Freedom'' seized from theaters across the country, hours after the government gave permission for it to be shown. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> issued the order in the evening under state of emergency regulations. The order came less than nine hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Publication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the government's censorship body, announced the film could be shown. `` ` Cry Freedom' endangers the safety of the public, the maintenance of public order and will delay the termination of the -LRB- 25-month -RRB- state of emergency,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said in a statement. He said the film contained `` propagandistic elements'' likely to encourage unrest and was biased against police. Thirty theaters began showing the movie this morning, a half hour after permission was granted. The first showing at a downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> cinema attracted about 200 viewers, white and black, to a 350-seat theater. Blacks in the audience cried and sang along with the soundtrack at various emotional scenes during the film. Several left the theater in tears. Movie-goers said police began arriving at theaters in the evening with orders to confiscate the film. The <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the film, about the friendship between <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> and white journalist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, could be shown uncut to viewers at least 19 years old. Later, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> noted that it had not given permission to quote <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, as actor <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> does in the film, because of <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' banned status under national law. There were explosions at two theaters where the film was to be shown, police said. There were no injuries at either of the theaters, the <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cinema </LOCATION> in the <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> theater in downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, authorities said. Police reported bomb threats at theaters in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. `` Cry Freedom'' had been scheduled to open today after government censors last November approved showing it without cuts or age restrictions. But Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Monday ordered the board to reconsider. He did not give a reason. The movie, directed by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON> and filmed in neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, stars <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> as <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> as <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> died in 1977 in police custody after founding and promoting the black consciousness movement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kobus </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooyen </PERSON>, head of the censorship board, called the film a `` mediocre product'' that had `` obvious and blatant bias against the -LRB- South African -RRB- police.'' But he added: `` The board came to the conclusion that the film does not present a risk to race relations or to the security of the state.'' The script is based on two books by <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who fled fled the country after <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>'s death. Some black youths said they were let out of school to see the film. `` It's a good film. If whites could see it maybe they would change their minds,'' said one black teen-ager who saw it. `` The brutalities and all those things -LRB- in the film -RRB- happened to us,'' said the youth, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Right-wing whites labeled the film leftist propaganda. Some blacks criticized it, saying it overemphasizes <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>'s association with <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. No one was officially found responsible for <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>'s death, and the film does not portray what happened to him in police custody after his arrest for violating a banning order that restricted him to his home in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> is shown unconscious, bruised, frothing at the mouth, lying naked and handcuffed in a cell. The film shows policemen tossing him naked into the back of a truck and his head knocking against the floor as he is driven hundreds of miles to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, where he died in the prison hospital. Those details are all based on evidence at the inquest into his death. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 The chief of a rocket fuel plant destroyed in an explosion May 4 says he will contest $ 36,455 in fines for 30 alleged safety violations. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Division of <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> is seeking the fines against <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The blast killed two employees at a <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> plant, injured 326 others and caused about $ 73 million in damage. The fines were disclosed Thursday by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkbride </PERSON>, information director for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Under state law the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> agency is barred from discussing the case. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer for the company, called the allegations `` wholly without merit, all of them, based on unsubstantiated allegations that have not yet been proven.'' `` We have asked for the evidence and whatever other data these charges are based on. <ORGANIZATION> DOSH </ORGANIZATION> has absolutely refused to furnish us anything,'' he added. `` We understand these charges are based on interviews subsequent to the May 4 explosion, so there is no evidence other than the allegations.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the company will contest the fines before an occupational safety and health review panel and, if ncessary, in court. Company executives blamed the explosion on a leaking natural gas line that ran under the plant, but the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that it was sparked by a welder's torch. Fire Chief <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON> said 8.5 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate, a fuel oxidizer used in the space shuttle and military missiles, was destroyed in the series of blasts at the plant 20 miles from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The charges include four willful violations such a exposing employees to possible fire or explosion through a lack of manufacturing controls and operating procedures, <PERSON> Kirkbride </PERSON> said. The state also charged a lack of emergency evacuation and response procedures, inadequate access to respirators and a lack of entry procedures exposed workers to potentially hazardous levels of toxic fumes, suffocation and death.

<TEXT>
 The ranks of the elite <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> will be joined in September by a lawman believed to be the first black to serve in the 165-year-old peacekeeping force, the Department of Public Safety says. `` I feel pretty good. It's been an ambition of mine for many years,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, a 14-year DPS veteran who currently is an investigator assigned to the criminal intelligence service in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officers, also known as state troopers, have duties similar to state police or highway patrolmen in other states. The <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, also within the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION>, are an elite force assigned to major crimes such as hostage-takings or long-standing murder investigations. They also are called on by authorities in small towns and less populated counties for help with homicides. <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> have a good reputation and are highly trained, <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said Thursday. But the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> has been dogged by charges of racial discrimination in recent years. There are five Hispanic Rangers and no women <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The National Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to sue. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a black state trooper from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, last year publicly voiced disappointment when he was n't selected for the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm happy for Mr. <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. This is a step in right direction for him and his career. I'm disappointed for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, because he really is the person who brought all this to bear,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> branch. `` It appears there would be a policy in the department saying we're going to start promoting a few people because we have to, but we're going to promote people who do n't complain or stand up for their rights, people who play by the rules of the game,'' <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON> said. Young and three white <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> officers will join the 94-man <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> unit in August and September, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. Ranger candidates first must pass a written test. High scorers then undergo an interview by a board of six <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> supervisors. `` There's a certain mystique about the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. It's a highly sought-after job in the department, and many people have to apply many times _ most do _ before they're successful,'' said Col. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> director. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said the reason there has n't been a black Ranger before is that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was the first black to reach the required level in the testing. `` They're all treated the same on the testing procedures. There's no difference,'' he said. While parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>' history are sketchy, Young is believed to be the first black to formally be included in the ranks. The <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> trace their history to the days when <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> still belonged to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> in 1823 employed 10 men to serve as <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> may have been thought of as operating against Indians and Mexican raiders in the early years and later against outlaw bands, feudists, stock thieves and local rioters,'' says a history in the authoritative `` Handbook of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' In 1935, the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> were reorganized and placed in the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> and now are stationed in towns across the state.

 New moves by the communist <PERSON> North </PERSON> and capitalist South to ease their hostility and work out an agreement on the Olympic Games are being viewed with great caution and little hope. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has accepted a proposal from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for inter-parliamentary talks on a non-aggression pact. The North also agreed to discuss participating in the Olympics, which would end a potential threat to the Games scheduled for September in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Contacts would begin in August if terms can be worked out. The South wants preliminary talks about an agenda but the North calls that a waste of time. Some South Koreans hope for a breakthrough to peaceful relations or reconciliation. One National Assembly spokesman said: `` Our position is that we would try to accomodate the North's demand as much as possible.'' Hopes that talks could remove any <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> threat to the Olympics may be premature. The North has not dropped its key demand to be co-host of the Olympics, holding some events on its territory, and may hope to force concessions. A North Korean agreement to drop its co-hosting demand and take part in the Olympics would be a stunning reversal of its position. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may be initiating talks in order to disrupt the Olympics by fostering uncertainty and tension up to opening day. The talks could become another test of nerves in a contest that has occupied the rival Koreas since the peninsula was divided at the end of World War II. Past negotiations failed to ease tension. The last talks collapsed in 1986 when the North pulled out in protest of routine U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The Olympics are a pawn in the struggle for supremacy on the peninsula and the North wants to be co-host in order to avoid losing ground. Each side claims to be the nation's sole legitimate government. They refuse to recognize each other and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> views the award of the 24th Olympic Games games as world recognition of its supremacy. The International Olympic Committee rejects the North's demand to be co-host, saying the games are awarded to a single city and can not be shared. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> says the Olympics were awarded to the nation and the two sides can work out a co-hosting agreement. It rejected a compromise under which it could stage up to five of the sports if it dropped the co-host demand. In proposing negotiations, the government in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> may be seeking a face-saving reason for not participating in the games. It could accuse the South of preventing a unified Olympics and claim to have sought a solution until the last moment. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agreed to the talks because of its desire to ease tension and protect the Olympics from disruption or violence. Officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> believe any kind of talks reduce the threat. Many terrorist actions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been blamed on the North. It was implicated in the Nov. 29 bombing of a South Korean airliner, which killed all 115 people aboard. Olympic and South Korean officials acknowledge privately that even a small border clash in the next few weeks could frighten away participants and spectators. The border is less than 50 miles from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> has claimed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are using the Olympics to conceal preparations for a nuclear war, and there are no signs that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s regime has abandoned its desire to reunite the peninsula under communist rule. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who started the Korean War by invading the South in 1950, said again Thursday that the Olympics threaten the North. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reinforcing massive armed forces in and around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on the plea of guaranteeing ` Olympic safety,' and at the instigation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever to keep our nation divided forever,'' he declared.

 The cream of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s haute couture designers showed off clothes that were both youthful and beautiful in the fall-winter collection. The week of showings brought lots of good news for fashion-watchers, including cheery colors to brighten up winter. After the hue and cry about the miniskirt, hem lengths are dropping somewhat, as designers realize that teeny skirts look ridiculous in couture clothes. A few hemlines sank to mid-calf length at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Feraud </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Givenchy </PERSON>. But most skirts came out hovering around the kneecap or just above, and there was new attention to dressy pants. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON> at Dior on Thursday won the week's official award, the Golden Thimble, for his youthful yet chic collection. Many who had seen the shows thought <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> deserved a prize for his superb collection of perfectly-executed clothes. But <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Berge </PERSON>, president of Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, has steadfastly refused the Golden Thimble. Only a few thousand women worldwide can afford couture clothes, which often cost $ 6,000 and range up to $ 25,000 for an elaborately beaded evening gown. Besides pleasing these women, couturiers have another purpose in turning out a collection. Couture clothes serve as models for good ready-to-wear, and boost the designers' fame and name for the big money stakes: accessory and perfume licenses. Suits made news in the shows, well shaped with waist emphasis and enough shoulder padding to give jackets style without looking hulky. <PERSON> Bohan </PERSON>'s suits at Dior were based on short skirts and snugly-fitted jackets with a martingale belt feature in back. Today's couturiers know that many of their best clients keep in shape, have face-lifts and look young. So they do n't have to worry too much about the portly Mrs. <PERSON> Gotrocks </PERSON> types that cropped up 50 years ago or so, and their clothes are geared to slim women. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s easily-fitted piped suede suits came out in glorious color combinations like turquoise and French blue, shocking pink and raspberry, chartreuse and rust. <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON>'s most artistic suede suits were the ultimate in luxury. Many were painted with landscapes, others had a cut-out eyelet effect. Trousers _ recently the domain of ready-to-wear _ made a strong re-entry. Even <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> gave up his little-girl bouffant skirts to soften his general lines, which included some palazzo or skirt-pants. The best appeared as a high-waisted `` tuxedo'' outfit with a flowing back on the cutaway jacket. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s striking group of tuxedo styles, including straight and uncomplicated pants, were a reminder that borrowing menswear in the right way can make women look fabulous. Couture showed plenty of coats for keeping warm in pampered comfort. The top furs, such as astrakhan, mink, sable and fox, were often dyed everything from pastel to hot orange shades, a nice extra fashion touch for the women who are bored with their plain old natural sables or lynx. The broadcloth, cashmere or mohair coats were beautifully cut, very fitted in long or short redingotes or princess coats, seven-eighths shortie coats and full trapeze-line models. Late-day clothes looked rich and alluring, as couturiers let their fantasies go wild. Plunging decolletes and strapless cocktail or short evening gowns sometimes had elegant little boleros or jackets for a discreet entrance to the party. The Renaissance and Tudor periods inspired some designers. <PERSON> Lanvin </PERSON>'s fur-trimmed taffeta gowns were striking enough for a film set. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> used page-boy velvet knickers or long skirts, ruffed white collars and cuffs, chains and jewels in his historical flights of fancy clothes. Couture's long gowns were stunning in iridescent taffeta, as well as combinations of velvet and moire, lace and tulle. Satin evening pajamas and dinner dresses were the options for informal evenings. The colors on runways were lively enough to warm even the most jaded fashion writer's heart. Many designers have fallen in love with lavender and amethyst, using it both for day and evening. Besides silvery gray and autumn colors like pinky brick, rust, forest green and raspberry, there was a lot of chocolate brown, cafe au lait, and cinnamon. Designers did n't stop at regular fall colors. They also went into sunny yellow, bright sapphire, poppy and carnation red, emerald, blazing orange, electric pink, fuschia and cerise _ especially in late-day clothes. Even though the vast majority of women ca n't even contemplate buying these couture clothes, they can serve as references for style and color when looking through the racks. And those lucky enough to afford the couturiers' ready-to-wear clothes, shown in March and already on their way to the shops, might find cuts and fabrics to echo couture quality. Just after the shows, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> designer <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> threw a couture-and-gardenia party for the fashion crowd in his workshop in the historical <LOCATION> Marais </LOCATION> district. Dressed in his favorite gear, baggy overalls and loud red basketball shoes, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> was jovially pinning gardenias on the women, and posing with live models and dummy mannequins wearing `` haute couture'' clothes he'd created, stitched charcoal gray outfits and one striking green and black satin gown. `` I'd like to turn out a whole couture collection twice a year and be accepted as a member of the Haute Couture branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Chambre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicale </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` But I was very glad to be accepted into the French Federation of ready-to-wear creators.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operation to frighten away doves that damaged engines and got in the way of planes at <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> was such a success that it ended a day early. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> volunteers this week set off fireworks and fired guns to frighten the flock of doves, and on Thursday spotted only four doves in three hours. `` Those four were in the air. They were trying to get out of town. I consider the bird program almost 100 percent successful,'' said W.J. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, airfield manager. Fifteen volunteer bird hunters began working Tuesday and had expected to be busy through Friday. Thirty to 35 birds were shot this week, most of them on the ground, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. Birds began flocking to the runway July 22 after grass was mowed and grass seeds dropped to the ground. A P-3 Orion had to abort a takeoff after birds damaged two of its four engines. In addition, a bird flew into and damaged another P-3 engine.

<TEXT>
 Four young men boarded a bus at a downtown stop early today and sprayed the vehicle with semi-automatic gunfire, killing the driver and wounding four passengers, police said. The gunmen, in their late teens and early 20s, fled on foot, police said. The motive in the attack was not immediately known, but robbery was ruled out, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Investigators were examining whether the attack was drug-related retaliation against one of the passengers, or a revenge shooting against the bus authority, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. At least a dozen shots were fired, police said. `` As the bus passed the shop where I was working in the window I heard _ Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! And Bang! _ six to 10 shots, and then the bus stopped,'' said a 15-year-old girl who did not want to be identified. She said she saw at least three people run from the bus, one of whom collapsed on the ground holding his stomach. She said the driver was slumped in his seat, with wounds to the head and torso. Driver <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> `` B.J.'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, 43, died about an hour after he was hit by gunfire several times, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Passengers suffered wounds ranging from minor to critical, he said. Details on their injuries were withheld. The bus line on which the attack occurred runs through one of the city's poorest and most violence-plagued neigbhorhoods. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> was a dapper man who had worked for the transit authority for 20 years, receiving several citations for politeness and helpfulness, awards determined by customer praise, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a spokesman for the agency. `` I think if one were to characterize the feeling here it would be one of shock, of grief, of puzzlement, of why this sort of thing would happen, and to this man,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study Finds More Violence Among Unmarried Couples Living Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Couples who live together are more likely than married couples to be involved in violent conflicts, possibly because married partners have a greater emotional investment in the relationship, a study says. The study by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> professors <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stets </PERSON> found violence occurred among 35 percent of the 237 cohabiting couples surveyed, 14 percent of the 5,005 married couples and 20 percent of the 526 dating couples. `` Every kind of intimate relationship has a risk of violence,'' <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> said Thursday. Cohabiting couples often are socially isolated, lacking the network of relatives that many married couples rely on to help resolve conflicts, he said. They also lack the material and emotional investment of married couples, he said. Though both married and cohabiting couples may share a high level of conflict from living together, a married couple is more likely to shun violence to avoid risking the relationship and losing the investment, he said. About two-thirds of the violence involved slapping, throwing objects, pushing or shoving, he said. Some violent episodes were more severe, involving kicking and punching. The findings will be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sociological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, who received two birthday cakes and 75 roses for his 75th birthday, chatted Friday with his successor <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> about everything from <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations to recent Arab unrest. In a rare interview with <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, the reclusive Begin, who marks his birthday Saturday, said in a hoarse voice that he would spend the day reading. `` Those who remember -LRB- my birthday -RRB- and want to come _ come,'' he said. Begin's longtime aide <PERSON> Yehiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadashai </PERSON> said about 150 friends and relatives of the former prime minister will visit his home at the edge of the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> on Saturday to offer birthday greetings. Begin, who led his country to war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to peace with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, was once the fiery leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, now led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. Today, the Nobel Prize winner rarely leaves his house and entertains guests infrequently. But on Friday he met his successor for 35 minutes. `` Mr. Begin is in a good mood and excellent health,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told reporters outside Begin's house. He said the two had spoken `` about everything, of course, including politics.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s aides said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not bring Begin a present. But <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Plaza Hotel brought in a huge round cake decorated with the figure 75, and the city's King <PERSON> David </PERSON> hotel sent a heart-shaped marzipan cake and a basket with 75 white and red roses. Passers-by stopped to look at the modest home, which is protected by metal bars on the windows and guarded by a security officer in a glass booth. `` I wish Begin -LRB- to live -RRB- until 120,'' a young woman named <PERSON> Geula </PERSON> shouted in a popular Israeli expression. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he and Begin discussed the nearly 8-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories, and that the former leader `` thinks it will pass.'' He said Begin was very pleased to hear about the first trip of an Israeli diplomatic group to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since 1967 and `` hopes to see positive developments.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the two men also discussed elections scheduled for November, but he was not sure if Begin would use his popularity to give <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> a boost in the campaign. `` It depends on him,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. Begin's 45-year-old son, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>, has been chosen by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> to run as a candidate for parliament in the Nov. 1 elections. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> added that he regularly confers with Begin about current political affairs. Begin was elected prime minister in 1977. In 1978 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> for the process leading to their historic peace treaty, signed the next year. In 1982, Begin led <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, beginning a three-year war. He resigned in 1983, never publicly giving a reason. Aides said he was depressed by Israeli casualties in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the death in 1982 of his wife, <PERSON> Aliza </PERSON>.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> today denied that his peace talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are in trouble because of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on a face-to-face meeting with its foe. The secretary-general scheduled a meeting later with the Iranian foreign minister, but not with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s envoy. `` Be patient,'' he told reporters. `` And we will make progress rather soon ... I am constantly in touch with the parties. I keep working.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he would speak to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> when he needs to see him. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> has not met <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> since their first two meetings Wednesday, when <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> stated that there could be no cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war without direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, has met the secretary-general four times. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has rejected direct talks with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> before a cease-fire. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he set no deadline for the talks and would work through the weekend. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the talks are faltering over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct talks. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team of military experts would arrive in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> tonight to work out details for a cease-fire. The team has been in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused each other Thursday of blocking the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end their 8-year-old war. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> acknowledged an impasse and, when asked if he had a formula for breaking it, said: `` I'm working on that.'' But he added, `` At some stage, direct talks are indispensable.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiations toward ending the war are being conducted under <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to soon after it was adopted in July last year but which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did not accept until this month. It provides for a cease-fire followed by withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which side started the war. `` The policy of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is to put obstacles in the way of the secretary-general's peace efforts,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarif </PERSON>, counselor at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>. `` This whole Iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the efforts upon which the international community is looking with hope.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> accepted all of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s proposals on implementing the peace plan. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not yet responded, and details of the proposals have not been disclosed. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of `` simply seeking a hasty truce without giving any commitments that it will comply honestly and sincerely to the full implementation of the resolution as a plan for comprehensive and durable peace.'' Both sides reported fighting Thursday at <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION>, 60 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which says it has withdrawn from Iranian territory, describes the invaders as Iranian rebels, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says they are Iraqi troops. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, <PERSON> Saadun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, the acting foreign minister, summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ and insisted on a peace treaty. `` This is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement'' of the war, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> television quoted him as saying. But he added that `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is for an early, immediate cease-fire as a means to end the war within the framework of a comprehensive peace settlement.'' Pressure was increasing on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that could prolong the fighting, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> did not visit <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Thursday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> suspended talks for a day to study his exchanges with the Iraqi and Iranian envoys since Tuesday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said he hoped Iranian officials `` are reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some stage,'' but said he can not compel the two sides to do so if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is unwilling.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today assured the families of servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War that the government must persevere in its attempt to give `` the fullest possible accounting'' of their whereabouts. Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> POW-MIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed an agreement in which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will allow a joint U.S.-Vietnamese search for some 1,760 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service personnel officially listed as unaccounted-for. As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, a veterans group accused the administration of lying about its intentions in the search for POWs and giving up on live war prisoners still in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The National Steering Committee for <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to float Vietnamese currency down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> stamped with a $ 2.4 million offer for the return of any live American POW from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The reward offer has been made by several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and others. Committee Chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said the group plans to send a delegation to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in October to distribute stamped Vietnamese bills.

But we are following this offer up aggressively.'' In his speech today, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced that he was directing a `` comprehensive study'' on the issue of prisoners of war and missing in action, and that the report would detail `` our efforts, accomplishments and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest possible accounting.'' `` During the remainder of our administration, these efforts will continue on a priority basis,'' he said. `` We must call upon the next administration to do the same.'' `` For you, the families of MIAs and POWs unaccounted for, the Vietnam War is not over and will not end,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` For you, the only way we can ` give peace a chance' is to give you the truth: the fullest possible accounting of your loved ones. ... `` If there are living Americans being held against their will, we must bring them home,'' he said. `` Should there be anyone remaining voluntarily, their family deserves to know,'' the president said. `` And every American who has perished deserves to rest on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. And until our questions are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are alive.''

 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, a longtime advocate of tougher handgun controls, will be arraigned Monday on charges of using an unregistered handgun to shoot a teen-ager who took an uninvited dip in his back yard pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> will be arraigned on two misdemeanor charges _ possession of an unregistered gun and possession of unregistered ammunition _ in connection with the June 14 incident at his northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home. He was charged Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, court records show. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the district government's legal division, confirmed today that city officials had decided a day earlier to press the charges, each of which carries a maximum penalty of a $ 1,000 fine and a year in jail. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 62, was cleared last month of assault charges in the shooting incident after an investigation by the federal prosecutor's office. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said at the time that he believed <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> deferred that decision to the city, which normally handles such cases. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has frequently written columns calling for strict restrictions on handgun use, refused to comment on the matter when contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> `` My lawyers are doing all the talking. I do n't know all the details yet,'' said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who was scheduled to speak before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. After the shooting incident, pro-gun groups said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was being hypocritical for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice numerous times in his column. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he obtained the weapon after receiving death threats. The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that all weapons be registered. But <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, and that his son was told he did not have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said the shooting occurred after he heard noises in his back yard, called police, and then discovered <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and three other youths by his pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after the teen-ager lunged at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> disputed that, saying he had not threatened the columnist and had been shot while trying to flee. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released the same day from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He was charged with one count of unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service work.

 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a 10-day visit, will appeal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to persuade <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops and Turkish settlers from the island. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided since a <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> invasion 14 years ago. <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON> proposed the demilitarization of the country and the creation of a federalized republic. His schedule called first for a meeting late Friday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to be followed on Monday by a 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and a separate session with Lt.

<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> voters decide Tuesday whether to raise the jackpot limit on their struggling lottery and whether to give former first lady <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON> a chance to be the state's first female governor. In other primaries, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who filed at the last minute for a seventh term after dropping his presidential bid, faces three little-known Democrats. Several candidates from both parties had entered the race for the 3rd District, which includes part of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and its suburbs, but most of the Democrats bowed out when <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s plans changed. And Democratic farm activist <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryts </PERSON> will try to win his party's nomination for the 8th District congressional seat. That would entitle him to a rematch with Republican Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, who won by 8,000 out of 150,000 votes cast in 1986. In 1981, Cryts gained national attention by taking 32,000 bushels of his family's soybeans out of a grain elevator that went into bankruptcy and was padlocked. Cryts is expected to easily knock off his three primary opponents. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>, 61, who paints herself as a compassionate friend of working Missourians, is considered the Democrats' best bet for unseating Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>. She's expected to face little trouble with her only primary opposition, <PERSON> Lavoy </PERSON> `` Zaki'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area teacher who is making his second bid for governor. `` Sure, lightning could strike and something could happen, but the Democrats do n't seem to have much of a primary fight,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I just ca n't imagine <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> not winning.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>' husband, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, served as governor during 1965-73. She was first elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1979. She has the backing of party regulars and has already launched a television campaign. Primary races have been overshadowed by campaigns for key constitutional amendments that will be on the primary ballot. One would remove most spending restrictions on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s 2 -LCB- - year-old lottery, a change supporters call crucial in light of a $ 24 million drop in sales during the last fiscal Officials say the decline was probably caused by a lack of advertising. Current restrictions require that 45 percent of lottery proceeds go for prizes, 45 percent to the state and 10 percent for administrative costs, including advertising. Critics say the 45 percent prize limit does not allow the lottery to compete with neighboring states with higher prize structures. The amendment would change the prize limit to a minimum of 45 percent, and lottery officials would like to give out about 50 percent in prizes. It would also permit the state to spend more on advertising. Another constitutional change would reduce from two-thirds to four-sevenths the vote majority needed to pass bond issues for street and bridge repairs, schools and other facilities. Supporters say <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is one of only five states that require the two-thirds majority, which they say unfairly limits school districts and cities in their abililty to make improvements. In five of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s six statewide offices up for election this year, Republican incumbents, such as <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, face no primary opposition. And although neither <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> nor his Democratic challenger, state Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, face primary opposition, the race has turned into one of the hottest of the summer as <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> tries to chip away at <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>'s support. One of the most crowded primary races is the shoot-out going on in southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s 7th <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> congressional district, where four Republicans and three Democrats are running to replace retiring Rep. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a Republican. About 900,000 voters, or one-third of the state's registered voters, are expected to go to the polls Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday he will pass on to his successor a program for `` the fullest possible accounting'' of servicemen still missing from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, acting on the assumption that `` some of our countrymen are alive.'' Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> POW-MIA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also called upon the government of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to move rapidly to determine the fate of the 2,394 American servicemen still missing or unaccounted for from the Southeast Asian conflict. He urged the Cambodian government to return the remains of Americans that the Cambodians have said they are holding. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said efforts to secure an accounting of the missing `` will continue on a priority basis'' during the less than six months remaining in his administration. `` We must call upon the next administration to do the same,'' he said. `` In preparation for transition, I am directing a comprehensive study on the POW @ MIA issue, detailing our efforts, accomplishments, and what remains to be done to achieve the fullest possible accounting.'' He said the study would be made public. `` I implore the governments concerned to respond to our previous proposals,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Should there be anyone remaining voluntarily, their family deserves to know. And every American who has perished deserves to rest on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil. And until our questions are fully answered, we will assume that some of our countrymen are alive.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lists 1,758 Americans as unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 547 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and 6 in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the government in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> `` has once again raised our hopes for a breakthrough'' by agreeing to a joint U.S.-Vietnamese search for some of those missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We have witnessed promises made in the past by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> that were not carried out, but we are following up this offer aggressively,'' he said. `` We look forward to its fulfillment.'' The president also took note of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s recent announcement of plans to withdraw its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` If they are serious, then it is time to move rapidly to resolve the POW-MIA issue; for the deep pain that this issue brings to the American people will turn against <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> if it lingers past a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> settlement,'' he said. `` It is in the interests of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to position itself for a new era and to help bring this to pass.'' As for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, he said, `` The government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> has announced they are holding the remains of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> but have yet to agree to our proposals to receive them. I call upon them today to do so.'' As <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> finished his speech, a woman in the audience called out, `` Do n't abandon them; please do n't abandon them.'' In the hotel lobby and outside, demonstrators wearing badges identifying themselves as members of the `` Forget Me Not Association,'' shouted `` Freedom Now'' and demanded stepped-up action to find the missing. At the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION>, the National Steering Committee for <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to float Vietnamese currency down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> stamped with a $ 2.4 million offer for the return of any live American POW from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The reward offer has been made by several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and others. Committee chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kinston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said the group plans to send a delegation to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in October for distribution of stamped Vietnamese 200 and 500 `` dong'' bills. He said 20 million dong would be distributed, worth between $ 5,000 and $ 8,000. Relatives of missing Americans floated balloons on the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> carrying the same reward offer last September after <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials stopped their plans to launch the balloons into the air. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials criticized the balloon launch plan, saying it might hinder government efforts to gain an accounting of those missing.

<TEXT>
 The peasant woman crouched in the lamplight and whispered bitter tales of sheltering her sons from Sandinista army recruiters and heeding the demands of the anti-government rebels. She said she wants to survive in this remote southern mountain village, where soldiers from both camps in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s six-year civil war pass through the steep paths, leaving their mark upon the lives of the peasants. `` We have to get along with both sides just to be able to live,'' the woman said. She and a dozen relatives gathered around a homemade kerosene lamp in her two-room wooden house. `` We try to avoid both, even though the Contras in these parts do n't recruit by force, but the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> do,'' she said. The woman, her relatives and neighbors spoke over the course of two days to a reporter visiting this rugged village, 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabla </ORGANIZATION> is accessible only by foot or horse along steep hills and narrow paths knee-high in mud most of the year. They told their stories on the condition their names not be used for fear of revenge by the leftist Sandinistas or the rebels, known as Contras. The Soviet-supplied Sandinista troops and the U.S.-supported rebels agreed to suspend military operations four months ago. Residents say the recruitment continues and the fighting has grown less frequent but has not stopped. The 49-year-old woman knows the effects of vengeance first-hand. Contras killed her husband and eldest son. Sandinista rockets struck her home, killing her cousin and injuring four of her children. The poor peasants in <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tabla </LOCATION>, like many others in isolated battle zones, express their helplessness at being caught between two armies. Their allegiance lies with the latest group trudging through carrying guns. The residents of the village said they do n't sympathize with either side. They just want to be left alone. The Contras from the southern front dominate the area and have major base camps nearby. The government does n't. That means the rebels are known in the village, while the Sandinista soldiers are strangers. The Contras pass through, demanding civilian support, which usually means feeding passing troops. `` If someone comes to my house with a rifle and asks for coffee, can I say no? Of course not,'' one resident said. `` You see what happens to us, peasants who just want to work. If we give our moral support to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> the others would cut our throats and vice versa.'' The Contras garner some favor by not pressing the youths into their ranks, but they exact a high price for locals who don the Sandinista uniform or appear to aid the leftist government. `` My husband was killed by the Contras in 1984. They slashed his throat and tossed the body in the river,'' the woman recounted, her voice hushed and calm. `` They said he was with the Sandinistas.'' Contras killed her oldest son a year earlier because he was serving the government's mandatory military service, she said. Three of her adult sons, aged 23 to 28, spend much of their time hiding from passing government troops. They constructed a trench by the riverbank for the men to escape from Sandinista recruitment and for the family to flee during battles between the warring factions. `` I'm off,'' the 25-year-old son said. `` I move like a snake in the mountains when the Sandinistas come.'' His mother said several of the local boys forced into military service left the government ranks with their weapons and joined the Contras or turned their arms over to the rebels. On a recent night, after the family had gone to sleep, a young man called at the latched door. He wore the camouflage uniform of the Sandinista army and carried a government-issued AK-47 assault rifle. He had gone a day earlier into the closest small city, <LOCATION> Verdun </LOCATION>, and was recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. He, like many others before him, fled. `` Now he has to decide if he'll join the Contras or just turn over his rifle,'' one of the sons said. His mother rails against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, whom she frequently refers to as communists, and the Contras, who she says `` come and take everything without paying a penny.'' The woman heeds the Contra demands and feeds the troops. In retaliation, she said, a Sandinista helicopter fired rockets into her home in September during a government offensive to roust rebels from the surrounding hills. `` They knew what they were doing,'' she said, pointing to where the rockets crashed through the wooden roof into the kitchen. `` They said we were Contras because we gave them food. And if you speak against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> they put you in jail.''

<HEAD>Laboratory Studies Suggest Immune Cells May Block Diabetes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Studies in diabetic mice suggest that a drug that stimulates the immune system may stop the destruction of insulin-producing cells and thus prevent diabetes, a researcher said Friday. Stress and viral infections also have been found to affect the development of diabetes, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON>, a geneticist at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said he and his colleagues had expected that an immune-stimulating drug would make diabetes worse in the mice they studied. Instead, it apparently brought the diabetes under control. The form of diabetes that requires insulin injections is thought to occur when the body's immune system attacks its own insuling-producing cells, or beta cells, in the pancreas, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> explained. The drug, a substance called interleukin-2 that occurs normally in the body in small amounts, activates the immune system cells and thus should have accelerated the destruction of beta cells, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said. It appears, however, that the drug activated some kind of immune cell that has the normal function of preventing the body's defenses from attacking the body itself. In the mice, it blocked the destruction of beta cells. This finding _ in mice specially bred to have diabetes _ may not hold any immediate importance for humans, but it does shed light on the basic processes underlying the development of diabetes, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said. Mice and humans share many genes and a variety of diseases. <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> has determined that in the mice he studied, a strain called non-obese diabetic or NOD, at least three separate genes seem related to the development of diabetes. He has also found that stress appears to aggravate the development of diabetes, which occurs only in the males of that mouse strain. Mice that were kept in standard, crowded cages with other males and were subjected to the stress of having blood and urine samples taken periodically have about a 50 percent chance of developing diabetes. In contrast, individual male mice left alone in a cage with a female for breeding developed diabetes at about half that rate, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON>'s work is among many recent studies that are helping to clarify the role of the immune system in diabetes, he said. For example, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B.A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Oldstone </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, recently found that infection with a virus could block the destruction of beta cells in NOD mice. <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said viral infections stimulate the production of interleukin-2. <PERSON> Oldstone </PERSON>'s infected mice might have produced more interleukin-2 and that might be the reason their diabetes was brought under control, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said. And Japanese researchers have found that NOD mice develop diabetes at a higher rate when raised in a completely germ-free environment. It is as if the immune system, freed from the responsibility of preventing infection, becomes `` introspective,'' looking for things in the body to attack, <PERSON> Leiter </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an aviation pioneer and airline executive who claimed to be the first person to save his own life with a free-fall parachute, has died at the age of 92. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who rose to the presidency of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, died at home Thursday. He began his aviation career in 1917 in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which sent him to test <PERSON> Caproni </PERSON> bombers in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. His live-saving use of a free-fall parachute, activated by the user rather than by a static line on the plane, occurred Oct. 20, 1922, while he worked as a test pilot. He said he had to jump when the experimental plane he was flying over <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, began breaking up. `` I pulled the parachute release ring, or what I thought was the release ring ... found I was falling with my head down, my feet pointing to the sky and my body rotating,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said in a 1987 interview. `` I pulled the release ring and the parachute promptly turned me rightside up. I remember looking at the parachute and wondering how such a great expanse of white silk could be so clean, even though it had plenty of opportunity to be soiled in a dirty hangar.'' He landed on brick pavement under a grape arbor near <LOCATION> McCook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, where the flight had begun. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also flew as a cropduster in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and helped set up the <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag airline south of the equator. In 1942, he returned to military service to help organize the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. He retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 as a brigadier general. In the next two decades, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and president of <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. He retired in 1965. He is survived by a son, a daughter and four grandchildren. A memorial service is planned Sunday in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, proclaiming a major victory for water users in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, said today the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has taken the position that wilderness areas have no implied rights to water. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told a news conference that Atty. Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has concurred with the department solicitor's legal opinion that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must specifically award water when it creates a wilderness area. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> noted that there are conflicting <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinions taking opposite sides of a major question in the arid West: without a specific statement by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is a wilderness area guaranteed the water it needs for proper management? `` The current administration feels threatened in the West because of the all-out offensive by -LRB- Democratic presidential nominee -RRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., who sat in the audience at the news conference, which he said simply reiterated policy the administration has been following The action runs counter to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in 1985 and to a 1979 ruling by an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> solicitor during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` This marks a new low in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s flagrant disregard for the law,'' she said. `` I am surprised that they could find an attorney willing to sign his name to the document.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said the administration was coming down on the side of a recent ruling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that there are no water guarantees unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> writes them into wilderness legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been skirting the issue in wilderness bills, remaining silent on water rights and leaving the question up to the Interior and Agriculture departments and court rulings. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> noted that very frequently, `` in order to get this water -LRB- for wilderness -RRB-, you have to take it away from someone else.'' He said that under the policy, the administration would not go to court to argue that wilderness areas have implied water rights. In a letter to <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that without directives from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the government will handle water needs of wilderness areas under the various state mechanisms that apportion water among often-competing users. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said the policy has `` the distinct possibility'' of extending beyond the current administration because `` there would be a substantial burden of proof on a new attorney general to sweep this aside.'' `` This is a major victory for the western states, water users and the principles of federalism,'' said <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, flanked by a group of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers from the West. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend to reserve federal water rights for wilderness purposes when it created the national wilderness preservation system in 1964,'' he said. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said the rights of existing water users, including federal forests, parks and wilderness areas and Indian tribes, would be protected.

 Several countries have begun calling their diplomats home from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> after a barrage of guerrilla rocket attacks on the Afghan capital, Western diplomats said Friday. Within one week in mid-July, as many as 200 rockets blasted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. A rocket smashed into a wing of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, damaging the ambassador's residence but causing no injuries. Another rocket landed near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound, blowing out windows in a nearby apartment building and the Radio Afghanistan complex, the diplomats said. Earlier this month, a rocket hit a club that is a gathering spot for diplomats, and one person was injured. Western diplomats said most foreign missions have already sent dependents home while others are planning to soon. They spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he did not know of any damage to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in recent days. He declined to say how many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were assigned to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know of any plans to change our presence,'' he said. The thinning out of foreign personnel in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has been a two-phased exercise, said diplomatic sources, with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European missions making the first move. Most senior personnel at these missions left the Afghan capital under the pretext of `` vacations,'' said diplomats. `` Very junior personnel'' now head most East European missions, they said. The diplomats continued to emphasize the increased role of Soviet forces in the defense of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. After a year's absence, Soviet armor has been redeployed to the west of the city in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kargha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> area. Western diplomats said the government's control of the key district town of <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION>, nine miles west of the capital, is in jeopardy. Earlier reports claimed 4,000 Afghan guerrillas massed around <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION>, and diplomats said Soviet and Afghan army troops as well as officers with the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> secret service, <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION>, and army commando units moved into the <LOCATION> Paghman </LOCATION> plain to reinforce embattled government troops. The growing involvement of Soviet forces in the defense of the capital has increased speculation about the Afghan government's chances of survival once the Soviet troop pullout is completed An April 14 accord negotiated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> provided for the phased withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Half of the estimated 100,000 troops are to be out by Aug. 15 and the remainder by Feb. 15. Soviet troops and tanks moved into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to prop up the struggling communist government.

 Arabs in the occupied territories staged a near-total commercial strike Friday in a show of solidarity with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> women held in Israeli jails. Three Arabs were reported wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. An extremist faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> called on residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to reject negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> put out a leaflet calling dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> an illusion. It criticized <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, who recently advocated <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> talks under the auspices of an international conference. `` At the same time your uprising is getting better and better, some in the field are going back to their old tactics and trying the way of dialogue and negotiations,'' said the leaflet, which was distributed in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` These are nothing but illusions.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders were divided in their reactions to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision on Thursday to cancel a $ 1.3 billion development fund for the occupied territories. Pro-Jordanian figures who favor continued <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> involvement in the territories said the cancellation would increase hardships for Palestinians, who have already suffered considerably during the uprising. Deposed <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawaa </PERSON>, alligned with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, said the move was `` regrettable because people here need help, and this was an important source of help.'' But pro-PLO figures did not oppose the move, which was seen as an effort by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to disengage himself from leadership in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> affairs and give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> more responsibility. `` The <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> decision will not affect anybody,'' said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Natsche </PERSON>, deposed mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporter. He said that although Palestinians need aid from all Arab countries, they mostly need to remain steadfast in their opposition to Israeli rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Observation of Friday's general strike on behalf of female prisoners was almost complete, a reflection of the continued influence wielded by underground Palestinian leaders. Neither Israeli nor <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources were able to provide a current figure for the number of women jailed since the uprising began last Dec. 8. About 5,800 Arabs have been detained, according to last month's military figures, but the overwhelming majority are men. Protests occurred Friday in the Shati refugee camp in the seaside <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. He said he did not know if troops fired on demonstrators, but a local reporter said three men in their 20s were brought to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with bullet wounds in their legs. Since the uprising began 235 Palestinians and four Israelis have died. The army also demolished homes belonging to three Gazans suspected of instigating anti-Israeli protests, the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Friday. The demolitions took place Thursday in the Nusseirat refugee camp. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, the only movement was of children selling newspapers door to door, residents said. Central roads were blocked with rocks and burning tires and outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags hung from an electricity pole. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, also on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists poured oil on the streets to prevent workers from going to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On a wall, someone had written in red spray paint: `` Death to the Zionists.'' Streets of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, and the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were deserted except for soldiers and military jeeps, reporters said. Weekly Moslem prayers passed without incident.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday unanimously condemned the kidnapping of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observer in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but did not mention his pro-Iranian abductors. The resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, also demanded <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' immediate release and called upon <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members `` to use their influence in any way possible to promote implementation'' of its appeal for freedom <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted Feb. 17 by a previously unknown group calling itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades. He is one of nine Americans and nine other foreigners held captive by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife, Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, met with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` I am making a constant effort to obtain his release,'' he told her. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> did not speak to reporters. The secretary-general has raised the issue of the 18 hostages during talks this week with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief has appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to use its influence with the Islamic fundamentalist captors loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to gain their release. An Iranian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, later told a reporter that there had been no response from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to the secretary-general's plea for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release. `` I want to express my concern to you,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> when she met him in his office. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was chief of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observer group when he was abducted. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran also served as an aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has met with relatives of other hostages as well. The council's brief resolution said the council already has `` condemned unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and abduction'' and called for the release of all hostages `` wherever and by whomever they are being held.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Thursday it was concentrating on ending its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and had no plans to meet with former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> about freeing the American hostages. Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> `` does n't have a mandate to embark on anything other than implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598,'' which calls for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> efforts to bring about a cease-fire. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> would `` indeed not'' see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who said he wanted such a meeting to seek the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages. This week's peace talks raised hopes for gaining the release of Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, the weekly mazagine <ORGANIZATION> Ash-Shiraa </ORGANIZATION> reported that negotiations are under way to free the hostages. It quoted an unidentified informed security source as saying that high-level contacts were under way between officials of the hostages' nations and a state with `` direct influence on the hostages.'' The magazine gained international fame when it broke the story of secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in return for the release of hostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostages have not proved accurate. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was abducted in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, is chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Troop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a military observer group in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> about the hostages and asked him to convey a message to <LOCATION> Velayati </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. They said the secretary-general did so. But <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said his mission had not received a communication from Perez de Cuellar. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it could intercede to obtain the hostages' freedom if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it is willing to discuss the issue but has rejected any deal or payment of ransom.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked of secrets, both political and playful, as he continued his quiet search for a running mate and bantered with kids at a day-care center Friday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected Republican presidential nominee, also took a swipe at <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee has suggested that ideology does n't matter. Such talk `` just masks over his far-left philosophy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He toured the child-care center in suburban <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s Corner, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, bringing attention to his $ 2.2 billion proposal that would provide tax credits for relatively low-income families with children. While there, he played catch with children, pushed several toddlers on a tire swing and helped put tropical fish in a fish tank. `` When you put a fish in, do n't ever hold it by the hand,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He joked that he was special because `` I can talk to fish.'' One child asked him, `` Are you really going to get to be president?'' `` It's a secret _ do n't tell the others,'' the vice president responded. He said little about the last real question lingering before the Republican National Convention: whom he will choose as his vice presidential running mate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he thinks too much attention is being given to the matter, since `` I really believe the election will be decided at the presidential level.'' He has already contacted more than 12 possible contenders for the spot, according to aides. Asked whether he planned to call additional prospects, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Probably.'' `` We're going through some mandatory investigations,'' he said. `` I will make the selection in my own mind before I go down to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>'' for the Aug. 15-18 convention. In the meantime, he said, `` I will keep my own counsel.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he does not plan to announce his choice until the convention. Those already contacted by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> include former presidential-campaign rivals Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and several people whose names did not figure in earlier speculation, including Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, also has said he has been asked to submit background information. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has now talked with nearly everyone on his `` long list'' of vice presidential candidates, aides said. Campaign sources said the list to date also includes Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Colo </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>.; Govs <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and former Govs. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, who recently was nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be attorney general. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he hoped to have a tentative list completed by week's end. As for child care, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has proposed a $ 1,000-per-child tax credit primarily aimed at low-income working mothers, voiced opposition Friday to a $ 2.5 billion Democratic child care plan that would give the federal government a more direct role. `` I am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse that the federal government alone can not have a bricks-and-mortar child care program that's going to be effective,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You have to have choice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to have diversity,'' he said.

<HEAD>TV Serialization of Hindu Epic to End Amid Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An 18-month-long religious experience will end for millions of Indians when a TV serialization of a Hindu epic goes off the air despite protests that reached all the way to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The series `` Ramayana,'' which depicts the trials and tribulations of the mythical warrior-god <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, has been the most popular program ever on government-run Indian television. It is set to go off the air Sunday. The weekly half-hour show has become a ritual for up to 100 million viewers, who often watch on communal TV sets in small villages. In the eastern city of <LOCATION> Cuttack </LOCATION>, conch shells are blown and incense sticks lit to herald the Sunday morning broadcast in classic Hindu fashion. The show has raised controversy _ especially when its lead actor got involved in politics _ and spawned an industry in videotapes, comic books and toy imitations of the maces, bows and arrows used by <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> to conquer various demons. In three cities, garbage workers have gone on strike to demand the program be continued to include the traditional ending of the 2,600-year-old epic. In <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, a case is pending in court after a garbage collectors' union filed suit to plead for the show to continue. Union official <PERSON> Karam </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardesi </PERSON> testified that ending the epic now would distort the image of <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, who is an incarnation of the major Hindu god Vishnu. Many viewers feel the same way. <PERSON> Baldev </PERSON> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> scooter-rickshaw driver, told a passenger recently: `` I've read the book. There's more to come.'' Officials of Doordashan, the government television, insist the show will end Sunday with <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>'s coronation as king after 14 years in exile. After all, they say, the program already was extended once from a 52-week run to 78 weeks. But political pressure is beginning to take its toll. After the public protests were raised Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, Broadcasting Minister H.K.L. <PERSON> Bhagat </PERSON> said the government was considering whether to extend the story to its end. In traditional form, the story goes on to tell of the banishment of <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>'s wife <ORGANIZATION> Sita </ORGANIZATION> when she is suspected of infidelity, the birth of her twins <PERSON> Luv </PERSON> and Kush, and <ORGANIZATION> Sita </ORGANIZATION>'s being swallowed up by the earth as the youngsters are reunited with <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>. The retelling of the old <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> tale with its colorful costumes and vibrant action holds great appeal for the 80 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million citizens who are Hindus The serial is also ideally slotted at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, just in time for Hindus to watch the gods on TV after the ritual morning bath and prayers. But the magazine Illustrated Weekly of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in a cover article titled `` Goodbye Rama,'' said the serial also resolved an identity crisis for Hindus after years of `` smouldering at the shibboleths of secularism.'' In officially secular <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the magazine said, the serial revived `` their spirits, breaking them into a disturbing rash of religious, almost reactionary, fervor.'' Secularists were angered when actor <PERSON> Arun </PERSON> <PERSON> Govil </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>, appeared in saffron robes and urged voters to follow `` the way of the lord'' and vote for his man in a parliamentary campaign. The candidate lost, but that did nothing to lessen the show's popularity In the northern state of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, riots broke out when a power breakdown interrupted the weekly broadcast. Fans need not worry about missing the well-known ending of the Hindu tale even if show goes off the air. Producer <PERSON> Ramanand </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagar </PERSON> is now shooting the rest of the epic for sale and rental as video cassettes, an associate said. The weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> estimated income from videos of previous episodes at $ 10.7 million. `` For the commercially-oriented, all the serial's viewers are sitting ducks,'' it said. `` An entire industry of epic memorabilia survives on their addiction.'' One enterprising businessman has even started a `` Hanoomates Club'' for children _ based on <LOCATION> Hanuman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>'s monkey-king ally _ that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> Today says could produce $ 2.85 million in sales of comics and cartoon films. For those fans who can not afford such extras, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government television is offering another attraction. It will begin serializing another Hindu epic _ the Mahabharata, one of the world's longest poems at 18 volumes.

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Friday that Aug. 15 will be `` the critical date'' in judging whether the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is meeting its commitment to withdraw military forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We need to withhold final judgment on the withdrawals until that date,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> told reporters. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in an agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, committed to withdrawing half its force of more than 110,000 by Aug. 15. `` Our hope is that this in fact will materialize,'' <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. The withdrawals `` on the whole seem to be going pretty well as expected, give or take some figures that are not really relevant. ... Meanwhile, we are not particularly apprehensive about the withdrawal,'' he added. <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> met reporters at the White House after greeting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on behalf of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ul-haq </PERSON> and congratulating <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for what the minister called `` a foreign policy that has brought much credit to him, to his administration and to his country, and has indeed been a historical event.''

<TEXT>
 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> on Friday renewed his call for the nation to escalate the battle against smoking with the same fervor it devotes to illicit drugs, and he assailed a new smokeless cigarette as `` a drug in a cigarette-shaped dispenser.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> and other anti-smoking witnesses told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> should regulate any sales of the `` smokeless cigarette'' being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, even though the agency does not have jurisdiction over regular tobacco products. The surgeon general noted that `` Our nation has mobilized enormous resources to wage a war on drugs _ illicit drugs. We should also give priority to the one addiction _ tobacco addiction _ that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, as he has previously, declared that tobacco is as addictive as cocaine and heroin. And he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> should regulate any sales of the so-called smokeless cigarette because it `` contains nicotine, which is a drug in a cigarette-shaped dispenser.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> testified to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment about the 618-page, anti-smoking report he issued in May. `` Careful examination of the data,'' he said, `` makes it clear that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting. An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> barely has the resources to carry out its current duties without adding tobacco products to its jurisdiction. He also said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s report `` is a political document.'' `` Its conclusions conform with the Surgeon General's political goal of a smokeless society, and undoubtedly were reached long before the report was drafted,'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> announced last September that it would market the smokeless cigarette, which contains tobacco. Unlike other cigarettes, the company says, it heats but does not burn the tobacco to deliver the nicotine. Several organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to take jurisdiction over the proposed product by classifying it a drug. Several bills have been introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> authority to regulate the proposed cigarette. Currently most regulation of tobacco products is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has authority over food products, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee the agency is reviewing the petitions against the smokeless cigarette `` to determine whether this product should be regulated under the FDC -LRB- Food, Drug and Cosmetic -RRB- Act.'' `` One can see that the agency must attempt to differentiate between the traditional tobacco product, marketed without medical claims, and therefore not regulated by <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, and the newer innovations designed to deliver nicotine to satisfy nicotine dependence or otherwise to affect the structure or function of the body,'' he said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that if <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is serious about producing a safer product, `` I suggest they voluntarily submit the device to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for safety and efficacy testing as a new therapeutic agent to help smokers quit. `` If they refuse to do so then it is a clear signal that the product is meant to improve the corporate health of <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and not the health of the American public,'' he said. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the association urges the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to regulate the cigarette as it would any other drug delivery device. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballin </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> on Smoking OR Health, said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> already has sufficient legal authority and power to regulate both cigarettes and new alternative nicotine delivery products. `` The failure of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to assert this authority will inevitably and unnecessarily further jeopardize the health and safety of the American public,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has no basis to assert control over the proposed smokeless product, which he said will receive further testing by the company before it is marketed. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the law covers a product's use, but not its characteristics. `` Thus, cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco-containing articles marketed for smoking pleasure, and other articles marketed for smoking pleasure _ without therapeutic claims _ simply are not drugs or devices, under the general interpretation by <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the courts of the relevant provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Proposes Tougher Legislation to Punish Promoters of

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday proposed tougher legislation to punish Soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest, saying `` nationalist passions'' benefit opponents of his reforms. The Soviet leader told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to `` active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.'' `` Perestroika,'' or restructuring, is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for widespread economic and social change. State-run media also indicated Friday that a crackdown had begun on people in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly Armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The six-month conflict between the two republics over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> district has led to mass rallies, strikes and ethnic violence since February. The Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top executive body, intervened July 18. It rejected any change in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s status but called for measures to develop the region's economy and culture. The conflict over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> since he became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985. He indicated Friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups, but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke before a plenary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's policy-making body. A summary of his remarks was distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> outlined the reasons for a `` current aggravation'' of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Among the causes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> listed `` a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups, inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel, and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted that `` nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces,'' he suggested increasing accountability in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> laws for kindling ethnic strife. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not give details of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s suggestion. At the July 18 Presidium meeting, the Soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> annexation drive. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from Article 36 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which says the law can punish `` any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility or contempt.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the country's 15 republics, a law on `` equal use'' of the more than 100 languages spoken in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some economic autonomy for the country's republics and regions. In particular, the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, forcibly incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940, have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs. The labor newspaper Trud said 44 people in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city The paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration, but said 155 drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined. In its July 18th decision, the Presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the situation was stabilizing in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but said that at the `` urging of instigators,'' some strikes and protests were continuing.

<HEAD>Walters Says U.S. Ready to Release $188 Million Owed U.N.</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hopes to pay $ 188 million of its debt to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> before the year is out, to help prevent the world body from running out of money when it may need to mount a peacekeeping operation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told reporters he is `` guardedly optimistic'' that a cease-fire will be arranged to halt the Iran-Iraq war, and estimated initial costs of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force at $ 15 million to $ 20 million. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that if progress is reached at resolving other world problems _ including the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a transition to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> could face an annual peacekeeping bill of more than $ 1.5 billion. `` All of these are important to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and all are likely to involve the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> significantly,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` This increase in activity takes place at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is facing a very tight cash situation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s financial plight is due in part to the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, partly for policy reasons and partly because of budget constraints, has withheld or been unable to pay its full <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> assessments. `` At present we owe the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in excess of half a billion dollars _ $ 467 million for the regular budget and $ 70 million for peacekeeping,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> noted. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not paid its full assessment for three years. The initial withholdings were intended to spur the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> into making management and financial reforms. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said these changes were made in 1986. But in the congressional appropriations process over the past two years, other large cuts were imposed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> paying only $ 144 million of its $ 212 million assessment in 1987. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said it is too early to tell if the withholding of much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assessment has had a negative impact on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping efforts. He noted that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has said that without a large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payment the organization would run out of funds by November. If the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is required to mount a peacekeeping operation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, it could run out of money in October, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. But he said that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hopes `` to release $ 188 million in regular payments to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> between now and the end of the calendar year.'' Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., who sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendment to withhold payments to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, suggested the debt be paid over a period of years and <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said that might be done Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, D-R.I., the Foreign Relations chairman, said the international prestige of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` compromised by our deadbeat status.'' `` Frankly, it is embarrassing that the world's wealthiest country wo n't pay its bills,'' he said. Another witness, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, who was the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said it is `` simply disgraceful and dishonorable if, now that events are moving the way we want them to move, we again find some pretext not to pay our share of the relatively modest expenses of consolidating the peace.'' At a time when `` peace may be breaking out'' in several areas of the world, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general is being interrupted in the search for peace `` by the need to find enough money to pay the utility bills at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters,'' <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> said. He said that even if a cure was needed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> management problems, the tactic of withholding part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assessment was `` illegal, a clear violation of our solemn treaty obligations.''

 Thousands of sweet-toothed buyers, sellers and distributors stepped into a child's fantasy Friday as they wandered from booth to booth at a candy convention sampling free chocolates, picture cookies and Gummy bears. And they had plenty to smile about: Candy industry news is sugar-coated. Americans will spend about $ 12 billion dollars this year to consume about 5 billion pounds of chocolate and non-chocolate treats _ nearly 20 pounds per person. In the past five years, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> confectionery business has grown 3 percent to 6 percent annually, according to industry figures. `` Candy is rolling strong,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> DEBS </ORGANIZATION>, a confectionery distributor that tracks candy sales and trends. `` Chocolate is still an in-thing. The concerns over acne have been kind of disproven, you've got the dollar up so some pretty big advertisers are coming in.'' At the 43rd annual National Candy Wholesalers Association convention, which began Thursday and ends Sunday, there was little talk of cavities or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surgeon general's report earlier this week about the importance of good nutrition in preventing diseases. `` The whole issue of health has dissipated so much,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesalers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` As consumers have become more aware of their own health, they are much more likely to treat themselves to something like candy.'' Scant few granola bars or health snacks could be found on the convention floor, though companies like <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Veryfine </ORGANIZATION> juices had displays and microwave popcorn appeared popular. New sweets like Boogers, green and squishy and designed to look like the real thing, and Slime Slurps, gummy monsters that change color, had glitzy booths. Old reliables touted their time-tested sweets. `` Pez is more than a candy _ it's a system,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McWhinnie </PERSON>, popping open a new <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON> dispenser to demonstrate. `` It's great tasting and fun to play with at the same time.'' Pez was developed in 1927 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and the dispenser was introduced, sans heads, in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1950. Character heads and flavors were added in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1952. Today Americans consume about 1 billion Pez candies anually, <PERSON> McWhinnie </PERSON> said. But until recently, the company had n't resolved the common childhood lament: Pez topple over. `` Pez dispensers have feet,'' <PERSON> McWhinnie </PERSON> said, proudly. `` Now they stand up.'' Tucked in a corner of a floor redolent of chocolate, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, the president of the the 110-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Candy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, was handing out the LaFama, a chopped pecan and cream bar covered in chocolate. The company uses 90-year-old copper kettles to make the bars, which bear the same goofy package lettering used when the bar debuted in 1914. `` Good candy does n't go out of style,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 31, the fifth generation president of the company with annual sales of nearly $ 10 million. Nationally, Snickers, made by <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M Mars, is the top seller of some 750 different candy bar brands. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>'s Peanut Butter Cups, made by <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, is number two, followed by peanut and then plain M & amp; Ms. M & amp; M Mars and <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> combine for about 70 percent of the chocolate bar market. The reintroduction of <ORGANIZATION> red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms last year after an eight-year absence because of concerns over food dyes was the talk of the candy world. The convention was not open to the public, but kids will get a crack at the candy eventually. Organizers estimate two to three tons of treats will be donated to charities at the end of the meeting.

<HEAD>Reagan Approves Extension of Jackson's Secret Service Protection</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> extended <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection 30 days to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> time to arrange private security against death threats the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate says he has received, a White House spokesman said Friday Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had asked that government protection be continued, based on the defeated presidential candidate's `` assessment of threats against his life'' and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s plans to campaign for Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Easter </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said he had no immediate comment on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been resting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> the past few days. Losing candidates for presidential nominations generally have to relinquish their Secret Service detail as soon as the party standardbearer is chosen. So <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> technically had exhausted his right to such protection on July 22 _ the day after the end of the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` asked for an extension of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection, presumably through the election. He indicated that on the basis of threats against his life.'' Asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had furnished any details of death threats, the spokesman replied, `` No.'' Asked whether the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had tried to verify threats against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s life, he said he could not comment on such security matters. Only the president is authorized to grant <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection to non-presidential candidates. A joint <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> screens declared candidates and recommends to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which ones merit Secret Service protection. Secret Service spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said only that `` we do our continuing assessments of -LRB- the security needs -RRB- of anybody we protect.'' Candidates are generally as tight-lipped as the government in refusing to give specifics of threats they receive, although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has spoken several times in general terms of threats against him during this year's campaign. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection had been maintained without interruption since the Democratic convention _ during which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> formally won the nomination over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ while <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> weighed whether to approve the extension. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision was made `` within the last few days,'' the spokesman said. He said that giving <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> an additional 30 days of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection would cost roughly $ 600,000. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision specifies that there will be no further extension, the spokesman said. `` The feeling was that, first of all, he's not the nominee of the party, which is what the law allows,'' he said. `` Secondly, that it did n't seem reasonable to grant this extension once he transitions into a private security situation.'' He said there had been precedents for extending normal <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection because of extenuating circumstances. For example, protection was continued for a time for the widow of Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> after he was assassinated while running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership said on Friday that security forces may take stronger action to quell ethnic strife in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a southern province dominated by Albanians. The proposal was made during a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting on ways to reduce tension in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> between the ethnic Albanians and the Slavic minority, made up of Serbs and Montenegrans. It was broadcast on state television. <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s collective presidency, said without elaboration that the leadership `` is considering the additional engagement of ... a federal police unit'' stationed in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since last October. The paramilitary, trained and equipped to quell large public disturbances, was sent there to thwart an expected increase in ethnic strife. It has taken little action since its arrival, however, and it was not clear whether <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON> wanted it to play a more active role or was suggesting more units be sent. <PERSON> Vidoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarkovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> called for the dispatch of `` additional public security forces from the entire country to help in keeping law and order in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.'' About 200 Serb and Montenegrans from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Friday to demonstrate against what they say is persecution by the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority. The original plan was for thousands to make the trip, but most apparently heeded appeals by authorities not to protest during the Central Committee meeting. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population. About 30,000 Serbs and Montenegrans have left the province, the least-developed area of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, since riots in 1981. Franc Setinc, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, said: `` We can not allow the current ethnic strife in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to turn into a clash between different nationalities, because that would have catastrophic consequences on this part of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Ethnic strife in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> once earned the peninsula the nickname `` the powder keg of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and its local conflicts brought on World War <LOCATION> I. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is an administrative part of the Servian republic. <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, party leader of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> constitutional that changes are necessary so <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> can exercise its authority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and act against ethnic Albanians. He said `` counterrevolution'' by ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> `` represents a danger to socialism and to <LOCATION> Yugosavia </LOCATION>.'' The 1974 Yugoslav constitution granted a large measure of autonomy to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.

 Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> has been hospitalized with inoperable cancer of the pancreas, a church spokesman said Friday. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, 80, retired as Archbishop of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> following a heart attack in 1980, but has remained active in the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>, where he is a member of the Sacred Congregation for the Sacraments. `` The cardinal is gravely ill, but he is resting comfortably,'' archdiocese spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` Death is soon but not imminent.'' Last rites have not been administered, <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> has been at <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION> for a week. `` The Cardinal does hope that it will be possible for him to be discharged and go home,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` It's not ruled out that he might be able to go home for some time.'' <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> was named archbishop in January 1959, and his resignation was accepted by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> in July 1980. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> continued to administer the diocese until May 1981, when <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> was named archbishop of the 1.5 million-member diocese. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> was named a cardinal by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in 1969. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> was elevated to cardinal earlier this month. In a letter to priests, <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>'s heart condition had been successfully treated but he has suffered severe loss of appetite, weight and energy. Tests showed the presence of tumors, which have been found to be malignant. `` Cardinal <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> has spent himself faithfully with loyal dedication to the church for more than 55 years of priestly ministry, 40 of those years as bishop,'' <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> wrote. `` I ask for your continuing prayers in his behalf especially now in his time of need.''

 A second brokerage sacked a stockbroker today in a widening investigation of improper trading based on apparently leaked tips of impending Business Week magazine articles. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> dismissed <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a broker in its <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, office, after it detected suspicious trading by him, said spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costiglio </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> had worked for the firm for about 3 -LCB- years but had no further information about him. Business Week confirmed last week it had initiated an inquiry into suspected leaks of its `` Inside Wall Street'' column. The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> suspended a broker in its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, office, where 10 brokers are based, spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said today. She declined to disclose the broker's identity or career history. `` The suspension was the result of an internal investgiation which we conducted,'' she said. `` We've notified the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation is continuing.'' Officials at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office referred all inquiries to Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. The disclosure came a day after Wall Street giant <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it had fired one employee and was questioning another in connection with suspected trading based on pre-publication tips from `` Inside Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said it fired <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, 33, a financial consultant in its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office, after company lawyers uncovered records suggesting he bought and sold stocks with information from the column. People familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> inquiry also said the firm was examining the actions of a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> vice president, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had approved some of the questioned trades under a company policy requiring junior employees trading for their own account to get prior approval from senior executives, they said. No disciplinary action has been taken against him. Company spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> had worked at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office since 1986, but little other information was available on the former employee. He said that to his knowledge no charges had been filed against <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>. A man who identified himself as <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>'s father in telephone calls to <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyme </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said his son was unavailable for comment. He declined to discuss the matter or answer any questions. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> did not return telephone calls. In its Aug. 8 issue, released to the press late Thursday, Business Week acknowledged to readers it had discovered unusual trading in shares mentioned in the Wall Street column and had initiated an investigation. `` The relationship between Business Week and its readers is our most valuable asset, and we intend to protect it,'' said the note to readers. The note also said the magazine was cooperating with authorities in the probe and had tightened its `` already stringent'' internal security. Business Week, published by New York-based <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said last week its legal counsel was examining the entire operation for possible leaks. Magazine officials believe the information probably was leaked by workers at one of four plants that print Business Week or by a postal employee rather than a member of its editorial staff. Business Week confirmed it was investigating the situation after Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the initial disclosure about possible leaks of information involving the column. Professional Investor Report said its analysis of 20 stocks mentioned in the Business Week column had found at least eight stocks rose sharply the day the magazines came off the presses but before they were available to the public. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the major stock exchanges also are investigating the matter. Most securities lawyers agree that the past conviction of a Wall Street Journal reporter who leaked advance information to a stockbroker would deter journalists from committing a similar act. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> was sentenced to an 18-month prison term following his conviction of wire fraud in 1985 for passing tips about items scheduled to appear in the newspaper's influential `` Heard on the Street'' column. A federal judge this week reduced <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>' sentence to one year. Business Week, circulation 960,000, is printed weekly at four plants, including one in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, located near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. R.R. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which operates the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION> plant, said the company was conducting its own investigation into possible leaks at the 550-employee plant and at another plant in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and that anyone accused of wrongdong faced disciplinary action.

 A state appeals court ruled Friday that the feud between rival <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> delegations to next month's Republican National Convention must be settled by the party at the convention, not in the courts. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> GOP Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> hailed the decision as a victory, but former Chairman <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, who sided with a group of party dissidents, said the group intended to appeal further. The battle is between a delegation headed by party regulars, including <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON>, and one chosen by dissidents who took over the party's state convention after <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> abruptly adjourned it in May. The national party's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Contests will hold a hearing on the dispute Aug. 8, a week before the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Both sides already have filed briefs with the committee. Eighteen at-large delegates are involved. Thirty of the state's 48 delegates to the national convention had already been chosen before the state convention At a news conference shortly after Friday's ruling, <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> said, `` Today we're taking off the gloves'' in the battle with the dissident faction. In court Wednesday, <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, representing the dissidents, said <PERSON> Stuckey </PERSON> and other party officials were trying to disenfranchise political newcomers drawn into the party by the candidacy of Christian broadcaster <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said party officials had arbitrarily used party rules to bar <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters from participating in the state convention in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, says he does n't want his brother's bones back in a bag, because after 22 years he still believes Master Sgt <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> is alive in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose brother's name is carved onto the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Memorial as missing and presumed dead, said Friday he will join a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans group's unusual effort to advertise a $ 2.4 million reward to any Vietnamese, Lao or <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> citizen who brings out a live American POW. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> plans to go to the Thailand-Vietnam border in October and distribute thousands of dollars worth of Vietnamese currency stamped with a message offering the reward which has been pledged privately by several congressmen and others. If not stopped by the Thai government, which hindered a private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort last year to send reward offers up in hundreds of balloons, the group said it will float the bills in plastic bags down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and distribute them along the Thai side of the river. `` I do n't want bones. I want the live man. I want my brother,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told a news conference. He said in an interview that his brother, who would be 41 if he is still alive, was shot down with six other <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel on Oct. 18, 1966, over the northern part of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a dentist, said that a few months ago a woman who had worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> during the war verified information that his family received from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> 10 months after he was shot down. The woman said she had seen his brohter severely injured but alive in 1967 and was surprised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military concluded he was dead. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he has also received information from a non-American source, whom he said he promised not to identify, that his brother was now held in a camp in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. `` I have not seen any black and white evidence, but I believe he is alive,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. The veterans group's chairman, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, said the effort to advertise the reward by stamping Vietnamese bills originated with former <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> nurse <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, who took it upon herself to write messages on 3,000 bills she secretly distributed during a recent visit to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with a missionary group. Ms. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> of Winter Haven, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said she found no direct evidence of live American prisoners during her visit. <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials not to try to stop the bill-stamping effort. `` It may seem weird, but it's going to do what we want it to do _ advertise the reward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Cheers Hundreds of Seriously Ill Children with Newsletter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman whose 7-year-old son died of cancer four years ago now offers cheer to hundreds of ailing children in a monthly newsletter packed with jokes, puzzles and stories. `` I ca n't cure them, but I know how to make them smile while they're here,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, 40. Her 10-page newsletters, called Love Letters, go to 465 children with terminal or long-term illnesses in 35 states and four other countries, she said Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> said she began writing to seriously ill children in 1984, after the death of her only child, <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>. `` After my son died, I was cleaning out his drawers and I found his address book with the addresses of about 20 children who, like himself, had cancer. `` Remembering how important mail was to <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>, I wrote to them,'' she said. `` What I did n't expect was that they wrote me back and that lit a fire under me,'' she said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the newsletter made his three-week hospital stay `` much funner.'' `` I like the dot-to-dots and the mazes most,'' said the 12-year-old, who suffers from a behavior disorder. `` And on the cards they say that they love me lots, so I felt better,'' he said. `` It's the passion of my life. Nothing has ever made me feel this good,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>. `` When I lose one of my kids I grieve,'' she said. `` But it gives me a fervor, and I sit down and write some more letters.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> works part-time as a clerk to help pay the bills, but `` Love Letters is really my full-time job.'' The newsletters carry games, puzzles, jokes and `` witty and whimsical'' stories, said Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON>, who has made it a rule never to mention diseases or symptoms. But sometimes her correspondents address serious topics when they write back, and she draws on her experiences with <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>. One 13-year-old girl wrote that she was being teased by classmates because her hair was falling out. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> had lost his hair five times and it grew back, so I wrote her and told her it would grow back, too,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> said. When the girl's hair finally grew back, she sent a little lock of blond hair with a note that read, `` You were right _ it grew back,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> recalled. In the beginning, she was sending handwritten letters, she said. Now her pen pals get the newsletter, which is drafted on a computer. About a dozen volunteers help design and and mail them. Ms. <PERSON> Bremner </PERSON> said she does n't know how much is spent by Love Letters, a non-profit organization. Postage alone runs $ 300 in an average month.

<HEAD>Transport Minister Suspends Crew After Airbus Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Transport Minister on Friday suspended the pilot and co-pilot of an Airbus A320 that crashed last month and killed three people during a demonstration flight at an air show. Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> said in a statement that a preliminary report submitted Thursday by an investigating commission revealed `` no failure of the aircraft or its equipment.'' The plane, he said, followed all the orders provided by the crew. The computerized A320 is the latest <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> model. The company, a European consortium, says it is the fastest selling commercial plane in history. In the June 26 accident near <LOCATION> Mulhouse </LOCATION>, the plane failed to come out of a low pass, struck the tops of trees near a runway and crashed into a forest. <PERSON> Delebarre </PERSON> criticized the state-run airline <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, operator of the plane, for the `` inadmissible conditions'' of the aircraft's participation and mission at the airshow He said he was suspending the two crew members because of `` elements about the circumstances of the flight exposed by the commission investigating the accident.'' There was no elaboration on either point. There have been conflicting reports about the altitude of the plane at the time of the accident. The pilot has testified his instruments showed the plane was flying at about 90 feet, but sources quoted investigators as saying the plane was at 30 feet. Examining Magistrate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertin </PERSON> said the minister's decision does not influence a judicial investigation of the accident still under way. `` It is purely an internal sanction,'' the French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bertin </PERSON> as saying. `` It does not at all mean that the two pilots will be charged for penal infractions.'' <PERSON> Bertin </PERSON>, who is in charge of the judicial probe, added: `` This measure has nothing to do with judicial decisions which could eventually be taken.''

 The best advice for those attending the biggest convention in town is do n't pack any clothes, do n't forget the suntan lotion and for goodness' sake do n't stare. Nudists _ hundreds of men, women and children _ are meeting to have fun and get naked. `` Looking is not a no-no, but staring is,'' said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, an electronics engineer who is president of the 30,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure the staring is much worse out among the textiles.'' `` Textiles'' is a nudists' term for people who wear clothes. They are the outsiders at the 106-acre White Thorn Lodge, a pleasant, wooded campground on the <LOCATION> Ohio-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> border. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the national group, are meeting through Sunday to elect officers, organize committees, lie in the sun, swim and play games. `` It's the freedom. It's the comfort. Our society equates nudity with sexuality, but this is a totally non-sexual setting. People are just people here,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a nudism activist who brought her husband and children to the convention. `` I just like the swimming pool, the hot tub and the food,'' said her son, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON>, 8, a third-grader who wore only cherry soda on his face Thursday. `` Most people seek the breeze, the sun, the rain and the freedom of wearing no pantyhose,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, 44, a free-lance writer from <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` You tell the first lie of the day when you put your clothes on.'' Security is very tight for the convention. Clothed and nude men guard the gate. `` Textile'' reporters who shed only their ties are escorted among friendly families sharing lunch on picnic tables, smiling couples sitting on shaded lawn chairs and naked children running across the grass.

 When <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> opened her monthly electric bill, she got quite a charge. It said she owed more than $ 3 million. It was $ 3,500,043.00, to be exact. `` I nearly died. I called the company, and they said it was bound to be a mistake,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I said, `` Yes, it is.'''

But the clerk forgot to press a computer key to substitute the new amount for the old amount, he said.

 Television preacher <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> asked his congregation to judge themselves, not others, during a service Friday in the garden where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was buried. `` Look into your own hearts today,'' said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, reading from the Bible. `` Do n't judge others.'' Turning to his 350 listeners, he asked: `` Did you hear what I say?'' Several responded: `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Thursday for a 10-day tour of biblical sites, lost his credentials as an Assemblies of God minister earlier this year after he refused to stop preaching for a year as punishment for meeting with a prostitute in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. After the service, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> told reporters: `` God is the one who puts things in the past ... That's the beautiful thing about Christianity. People love, they forgive and they forget.'' He said he had been humbled by the public scandal that occurred after the disclosure of his sexual activities in February. The disclosures led him to confess tearfully on nationwide television that he had sinned. `` I think that I have more love for people now,'' said <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` I think that I feel their pain a little more ... This world is a hurting world and maybe I'm a little less condemnatorial, maybe I'm a little bit less accusatorial. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s congregants appeared moved by his 45-minute sermon. Some cried. Others raised their hands in the air and uttered, `` Hallelujah'' or `` Praise the Lord.'' `` I love him, I love him,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. But others voiced criticism of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` I would n't say his deeds enhanced his image,'' said <PERSON> Oleda </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` But you have to forgive.'' `` I was bothered by how the scandal was handled,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kester </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Siloam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Ark. `` I wonder about the soundness of his leadership.'' <PERSON> Kester </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the first time, said the country was `` a bit different from what I imagined.

<TEXT>
 The Duchess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, wife of Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, will soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy which survived two accidents, a family scandal and a flood of rumors. Buckingham Palace insists the birth is due in mid-August, but <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla, spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big day is imminent. The Sun newspaper said Friday the duchess' weight and other health problems may force a Caesarian delivery this weekend. On July 22, the Star claimed the birth was likely to be artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared losing the baby. Every other day, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> is prematurely reported to have left his <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to be at her side during the delivery. But Buckingham Palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing to comment on the press reports. The baby, to carry the title Prince or Princess of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, will be Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed her. `` Complications which could endanger mother and baby have led her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery,'' the Sun reported Friday. The newspaper said without attribution that the duchess' doctor had decided on a Caesarian section because she is suffering from high blood pressure and severe water retention, and because the baby is in a breech position, meaning it would be born bottom first rather than head first, as is normal. The Star added that the `` roly-poly'' duchess has gained almost 50 pounds during the pregnancy. The 28-year-old duchess, the former <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, married <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, the queen's second oldest son, in July 1986. When she did n't become pregnant in the first year, the British media speculated that `` Fergie'' was being treated for infertility, although her family repeatedly denied it. The duchess radiated good health during the early months of her pregnancy. She skiied in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, performed a full calendar of royal engagements and worked at her publishing job until February. When the palace confirmed her pregnancy on Jan. 25, the duchess was taking a helicopter flying lesson. Then came two scares and a family scandal. The duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> in March, when she was four months pregnant. Earlier this month she escaped injury when her car, driven by a police bodyguard, collided with another car on a busy highway outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the tabloids discovered that her father, Maj. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, was frequenting a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> massage parlor. The scandal almost got him expelled from his polo club. The duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of doctor and hospital. Instead of Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinker </PERSON>, royal gynecologist since 1973 and deliverer of nine princes and princesses, she has chosen Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a prominent <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> obstetrician known to favor natural childbirth. She has picked the private, American-owned <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, unlike her sisters-in-law, Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, who had their babies in the private wing of a state-run hospital. The modern <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> is said to be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most expensive maternity clinic. The Sun says Room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> was quoted as saying in May that the baby will be a girl and will be named <PERSON> Annabelle </PERSON>. He refused a gift of a child's cricket bat from a <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> cricket team, saying: `` It wo n't be much use ... I'm sure we are having a girl.'' However, the prince has a reputation as a prankster, and <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Palace </PERSON> said of his comments, `` It's all speculation.'' Bookmakers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> say <PERSON> Annabelle </PERSON> remains the favorite name for a girl and <PERSON> David </PERSON> for a boy.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ordered a special inspection of landing gear brakes on long-range <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 aircraft and directed that the brakes be replaced if they exceed prescribed wear limits. The order came in response to a May 21 accident involving an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 last May in which eight of the plane's 10 brakes failed when the pilot aborted his takeoff, causing the plane to skid 1,000 feet beyond the runway at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport. The three crewmembers in the cockpit and five of the 240 passengers were injured and the plane was heavily damaged. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive applies only to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 Series 30 and Series 40 planes, the somewhat heavier long-range version of the aircraft, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>. According to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, there are 66 of the long-range DC-10s in service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 229 worldwide. Among the airlines that fly the long-range plane are <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the freight carrier <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. Under the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order, the inspections must be made by Aug. 20 and by that date all brakes that do not meet prescribed wear limits must be replaced, said <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>. The order does not apply to lighter, shorter-range DC-10 Series 10 aircraft of which there are about 120 being flown by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers, generally in domestic service, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> officials. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as a result of its findings in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> accident, expressed concern about the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s brake wear requirements. The safety board urged a broad review of the requirements for all types of jetliners. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> it was in the early stages of reviewing its brake wear requirements. In the May 21 accident involving the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet, the pilot aborted his takeoff while traveling 204 mph down the runway because he thought _ erroneously it later turned out _ that his flaps or slats may have been in the wrong position. The plane slowed to 149 mph in the first six seconds, but `` the deceleration decayed rapidly'' and the jet went off the end of the runway still traveling 117 mph, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. The jet lost its nose gear and plowed through the dirt for 1,000 feet before coming to a halt. Investigators found that eight of the 10 landing gear brakes `` were near the maximum wear limits'' before the aborted takeoff and failed within 8 to 9 seconds after being applied, the safety board said July 11.

<HEAD>American Jewish Leader Urges Moscow To Adopt New Emigration Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A prominent American Jewish leader, after a meeting Friday with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to broaden its recently proclaimed policy of allowing Jews who emigrate to choose their new homeland. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jewry </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should allow more Jews to apply for exit permits to any country of their choice, rather than just <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> official said Thursday that `` It's up to them where they go.'' Most Soviet Jews permitted to emigrate are given exit permits for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but about 90 percent go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once they reach <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the transit point to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Concerned about the loss of immigrants, the Israeli Cabinet has ordered a change in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permits would receive their Israeli visas in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and go on to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. From there it would be difficult to get to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they would no longer have refugee status. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said the Israeli government `` has a right to make that decision'' and that it would be `` a travesty'' to permit immigrants from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to retain refugee status once they reached <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It would be a declaration that a Jew, welcomed as he is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is a refugee in his homeland,'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said. `` That would be a terrible construction of the meaning and purpose of the Jewish state.'' Soviet Jews who go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are considered immigrants under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law. As a result, it is much more difficult for them to gain admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than as refugees in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The situation has caused some strains between American Jews and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as disputes within the American Jewish community. The solution, <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said, lies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government's assertion that it does not care where emigrants chose to live He cited a statement on Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that `` we just allow all these people to leave the country. It's up to them where they go.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said `` as long as that is the position of the Soviet government it is quite possible for freedom of choice to be exercised in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' In the past year, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has increased Jewish emigration to the West to a rate of more than 1,000 a month, compared to 1,000 a year in the early 1980s. According to statistics compiled by The National Conference on Soviet Jewry, 60 to 90 Jews a month are permitted to leave directly for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said 6,000 non-Jews were allowed to go last year. `` So the idea that it is Soviet policy to prevent people from leaving directly on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visas does n't seem to be the case,'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said. `` In this case, it seems to be that what they say is what they have been doing. Let's hope they continue.'' <PERSON> Abram </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> supports the principle of freedom of choice. Otherwise, he and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to elaborate on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s position.

<TEXT>
 State agriculture officials banned the movement of some fruits and vegetables in a suburban area and made plans Friday to release millions of sterile flies to combat the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly. No new Mediterranean fruit flies were found Friday in the quarantine area, 62 square miles of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, a collection of bedroom communities 10 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` That's a very good sign that aerial spraying and ground spraying are working,'' said <PERSON> Gera </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The Medfly infestation was discovered in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Northridge </LOCATION> more than a week ago. Four Medflies have been found thus far. The Medfly, one of the most destructive crop-destroying insects, is common in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and probably was carried into <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on fruit brought by tourists. Last Monday, 16 square miles of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was sprayed with pesticides by helicopter, and ground crews also have been spraying. The produce quarantine, which began Thursday, bans removal or movement of home-grown fruit and garden vegetables in the quarantine area. The quarantine also prohibits the sale of produce from street and pushcart vendors. In addition, it bans residents from taking fruits and vegetables into their workplaces for distribution. `` By moving fruit out of that quarantine area, you may be moving Medfly,'' Ms. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said. `` The whole point of this is to make sure anything that moves is safe.'' Grocery stores and fruit and vegetable stands whose suppliers treat the food with pesticide will be allowed to continue selling produce. Meanwhile, officials said they plan to release 4 million sterile flies next week. The release of sterile flies will drastically reduce the chances of the female Medflies laying eggs, state and county officials explained. The quarantine is expected to last until early November, but agriculture officials said it could end earlier if the infestation is eradicated. There was a five-month, 110-square-mile quarantine in eastern <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in July 1987, because of a slightly larger medfly infestation. The state's most serious infestation cost $ 97.6 million in eradication efforts that continued from 1980 to 1982.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Angry at Wilderness Water Rights Decision</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in a decision angering environmentalists, said wilderness areas have no automatic claim to water rights, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said Friday. `` This is a major victory for the western states, water users and the principles of federalism,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, flanked by a happy group of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers from the West, told a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news confernce. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said that soon-departing Attorney Gen. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> concurs with a legal opinion by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> solicitor <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarr </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must specifically award water to a wilderness area when it creates the no-development enclave. `` This is a public resource giveaway of monumental proportions,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sease </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> are sacrificing the lifeblood of our wilderness areas _ water _ by saying, ` Come and get it, we wo n't defend it.''' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings disagree on a major question in the arid West: Does the mere creation of a wilderness area by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guarantee it will have enough water to ensure its proper management. He said the administration was siding with a recent ruling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that said there are no water rights unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> writes them into wilderness legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been skirting the controversial issue in wilderness bills, leaving it up to to the Interior and Agriculture departments and the courts to settle conflicting demands for scarce water. `` In most cases, these wilderness bills would not have passed if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had to take water away from someone,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` In order to get this water, you have to take it away from someone else.'' Under the administration policy, the rights of existing water users, including federal forests, parks and wilderness areas and Indian tribes, wold be maintained and protected, according to <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>. He indicated that new areas lacking specific statutory water guarantees will have to compete for water with other users before various state water allotment authorities. Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said that `` the people who live along the banks of the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are much better qualified to make decisions about water use than the people who live along the banks of the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' `` This is an important decision for all of us in the West,'' added Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, R-Utah. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said the policy `` will help us resolve an issue that has confounded us.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s announcement was immediately attacked by environmental groups and by Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., who called the news conference a political event because it reiterated a position the administration has previously taken `` The current administration feels threatened in the West because of the all-out offensive by -LRB- Democratic presidential nominee -RRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, who sat in the audience at the news conference. `` This is the first time I've seen a full-blown press conference on a solicitor's opinion,'' <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> said. `` This does n't solve anything except inflame things politically.'' The policy runs counter to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> in 1985 and to a 1979 opinion by an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> solicitor during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` This marks a new low in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s flagrant disregard for the law,'' she said. `` The spirit of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> is alive and well,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, referring to the administration's first interior secretary. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a water lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` the decision reflects just about as much careful thought as the administration's decision to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said the policy has `` the distinct possibility'' of extending beyond the current administration.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s commander-in-chief said Friday that enemy forces had pushed 65 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and threatened a provincial capital but that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had routed the invaders and was pushing them back toward the border. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is also speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, warned <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that if it `` decides to continue the war, then they must know that our strength today is by far greater than that of the time prior to the acceptance of the resolution,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution July 18. Speaking at a prayer service broadcast on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels entered a hospital in the western town of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and `` rained bullets on some 30 patients,'' killing all of them. In the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the rebel fighters, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION>, said they pulled out of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, 60 miles inside <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, after holding the cities for three days. The rebel group did not comment on the Iranian charges of a massacre. A seven-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team, meanwhile, arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss implementation of U.N. Resolution 598. The seven officials, led by Norwegian Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON>, arrived after visiting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and are expected to spend three days in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. They refused to comment to reporters. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> denied persistent reports that his peace talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are in trouble. `` Be patient,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. `` And we will make progress rather soon ... I am constantly in touch with the parties. I keep working.'' The process has stalled over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct talks and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s rejection of a face-to-face meeting before a cease-fire is declared in the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it drove the Iraqi-backed rebel fighters out of <LOCATION> Eslamabad </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, killing or wounding 4,500 invaders in a `` heavy battle'' against `` forces of the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> regime and their hypocritical mercenaries.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces were chasing the troops back toward <LOCATION> Sar-e </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pol-e </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zahab </LOCATION>, 24 miles from the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> border, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed. Iranian press reports, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said thousands of invaders were wounded and more than 1,000 Iraqi tanks and personnel carriers were either destroyed or seized intact. `` The operation destroyed the Islamic republic's cancer, which ... could have caused problems for Iranians,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> told the prayer congregation in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in an apparent reference to the rebels. In the sermon, he acknowledged the invaders had pushed 65 miles into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, coming within 22 miles of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. `` This was a revolt that had to be destroyed, and if the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> regime wants to continue its aggressions, it will receive the same response,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio interrupted its normal programs to play martial music and announce the victory over the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The rebel group, in a communique released in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, said its fighters `` returned to their bases'' Friday after three days of fighting in which 40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed or wounded. No independent observers were allowed near the fighting and claims from both sides could not be verified. The rebels, estimated at 15,000, operate a series of bases along the border. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the fighting arm of the resistance group known as <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalq </ORGANIZATION>, set up its headquarters in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after being expelled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986.

<HEAD>Youth Crackdown Triggers Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An arrest for underage drinking triggered a late night riot with 50 young people marching on the police station, breaking windows, and bending a flag pole and taking the flag, police said Friday. A crowd of up to 300 people gathered during the hour-long melee, prompting the 13-member police force to call on state police and eight nearby communities for reinforcements. Damage in the town of about 13,000 people in northcentral <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was estimated at several thousand dollars. Six adults and two youths were arrested. Three police officers were treated for minor injuries. Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> imposed a state of emergency, prohibiting groups of youths from walking the streets between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m. for five days. `` I'm particularly disturbed about them bending over the flag pole and taking the flag,'' he said. The disturbance was seen as the culmination of months of tension between police and young people who gather on the town's main thoroughfare, Market Street. `` All they want to do is loaf on the main street,'' <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said. `` There's drugs, there's drink, there's sex.'' Tensions flared late Thursday when police tried to arrest a teen-age girl and another youth for alleged underage drinking on Market Street. Police said the two, whom they would not identify, resisted arrest. During a struggle, an officer was kicked in the groin several times and other police were called, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. During the arrest, a group of 30 to 40 youths stood across the street and yelled obscenities, police said. After the two youths were wrestled into a police car, the group marched toward the police station, growing to about 50 people who knocked over trash cans and a soda machine, police said. At the police station, witness <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Selinsgrove </LOCATION> said he saw about six or seven people pull up plants, smash windows and urinate inside. Some people grabbed a rope on the flagpole outside the station, yanked on it and bent the pole and tore off the flag. Within 15 minutes, after reinforcements had arrived, about 75 officers and <LOCATION> Sunbury </LOCATION> firefighters formed a line and dispersed the crowd. Several witnesses told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Item </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that police were rough with the juveniles and later used nightsticks on some bystanders. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> told the newspaper he saw the girl's head being slammed on the roof of the police car. `` They did rough-house that kid,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauver </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Sunbury </LOCATION>. Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said police threw no punches. `` Force is sometimes necessary to effect an arrest,'' he said. <PERSON> Moll </PERSON> said he was satisfied with police conduct.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership on Friday adopted broad goals for making government more responsive, and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged pruning the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to exclude all but the best and brightest, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet leader asked the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to have the parliament meet in November to make constitutional changes allowing contested elections next March, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. But it was unclear from the report whether the committee adopted all of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal calls for multi-candidate elections to a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>' Deputies, which in turn would choose a full-time parliament of at least 400 members and a president with broad powers. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, issued a brief dispatch on the eight-hour meeting that included only vague descriptions of decrees and decisions adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 300 members. Its report on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s opening address said he touched on many issues, including youth problems and nationalities, specifically the debate over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> enclave is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> but its predominantly Armenian population wants it annexed to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The 57-year-old Soviet leader also said he wants the 20-million membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reduced `` significantly'' to include only the vanguard of Soviet society. At present, less than 10 percent of Soviet adults gain admittance to the all-powerful party. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said a nationwide conference held a month ago confirmed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s role as `` the real driving force'' of reform. He said the meeting's major accomplishment was recognizing the party's predominance. Membership rolls are to be reviewed before the end of the year. That process could be used to dump the idle and corrupt or to strengthen <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s base by revoking the memberships of his conservative opponents. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also acknowledged Friday that the nationwide conference also `` demonstrated that conservative sentiments, longing for the past, attempts to sow doubts, to portray perestroika not as a historic endeavor but almost as a social destabilization have by far not yet been overcome in society.'' `` Perestroika'' is the term for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and social reform. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has faced resistance from some party members who think he is moving too fast to change how Soviet society and its economy have operated for decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved resolutions on `` reports and voting in party organizations'' and on `` the general directions of reconstruction of the party apparatus,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. A special commission was formed, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as chairman, `` for the preparation of proposals for implementing the decisions of the 19th <ORGANIZATION> All-Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>,'' it reported. That forum, which ended July 1, authorized a major revamping of individual rights and the structure of government. Among its recommendations were limiting elected party and government officials to two five-year terms and multiple candidates for elective office. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was over and details of its actions would be published in the press. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s information department would not say whether changes had been made to the 13-member ruling Politburo. `` You will have to wait for the official announcements,'' he said, and asked that his name not be used. Western and Soviet sources had predicted at least one longstanding member would resign during the meeting and perhaps set a precedent for orderly retirement from the Politburo, whose members traditionally have served for life or been voted out in disgrace. Among those reported in line for retirement are President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 79, and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, 74. There have been persistent rumors that <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>, the Ukrainian party chief, would be ousted or retired and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police, replaced. The Politburo decided July 4 that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would meet to implement `` reforms of the political system, the democratization of party, state and social life.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has also called for a society ruled by laws, which he said would avoid a return of Stalinist repression or the corruption and stagnation that characterized <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s leadership. Resolutions adopted by the party conference provided an outline for change, which the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> must translate into specific programs and a timetable. They range from ending bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to making all non-classified government information available to the citizenry.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> issued reassurances Friday that it was not making or storing chemical weapons at all five sites the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would open up for inspection under a proposed international treaty. And a spokesman, Lt.

In a related development, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that has been investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chemical weapons program gave it high marks for safety. `` At the most critical point, where workers are in close proximity to the agent, the chemical safety program is the strongest. The workers at chemical storage areas are confident that they work in a safe environment,'' said the report, which was written by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and released by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee. The Army resumed producing chemical weapons last December after stopping in 1969. Spokesmen say the current so-called binary weapons pose fewer storage and handling dangers than earlier unitary weapons because they consist of two separate chemicals which are brought together in an artillery shell just before firing. `` The binary program is such that you never have a complete weapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kept together and they will not be mated until just before firing,'' said <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, the spokesman. Should a chemical weapons treaty be signed, said <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON>, all five sites mentioned in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> would be subject to whatever provisions it may contain regarding the inspection or dismantling of facilities. `` The context of Ambassador <PERSON> Friedersdorf </PERSON>'s statement is that at each of the locations he identified, facilities exist which are, or were at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons,'' the statement said. `` While all five of the facilities mentioned had some historical connection with production of unitary chemical weapons -LRB- using one rather than two chemicals -RRB-, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has not been involved in the production of unitary chemical weapons since 1969,'' the statement said. `` No chemical weapons production of any kind is going on at <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arsenal </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> plant,'' it said. `` The Army facilities at Pine Bluff, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, are involved in the production of a non-lethal component for the binary weapons system.'' `` No chemical weapons are being produced at <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> proving ground. <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> was formerly connected with the production of unitary chemical weapons prior to 1969.'' `` No chemical weapons are being produced at Muscle Shoals,'' the statement said. `` At present, the Muscle Shoals facility is involved in a pilot plant project which will be used to prove out the production process for one of the'' two chemicals involved it the final weapon. Spending for biological and chemical research has increased sharply since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980, the total research was $ 63.5 million, compared with $ 348 million figure in fiscal 1986.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials say their greatest achievement in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war was preventing <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> from exporting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic revolution throughout the Arab world. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> say the war also helped unite <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and make it a more efficient nation which will be able to better use its vast oil resources in the future, despite the tremendous debt and losses suffered in the 8-year-old war. The Iraqis clearly view the humiliation of the Iranian leader as the main benefit of the war, which killed an estimated 1 million Iranians and Iraqis. `` The most important outcome was not the technical victories we scored against the Iranian army, but rather the entire defeat of the ideological foundation on which the Iranian regime is based,'' President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a recent speech. `` Khomeinism was not only evil and dangerous to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the Arab world but to humanity at large,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in the speech, which followed Iraqi victories that led to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a cease-fire resolution on July 18. A senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official called recent developments `` a watershed'' because <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` accepted defeat'' and `` the notion of coexistence with a secular regime, of cooperation on political boundaries.'' `` By accepting this in a legal and political sense, it will be the end of a model'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> hoped to spread throughout the region, the official said. `` Nobody would imagine that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> would humiliate himself'' by accepting the cease-fire he had long opposed, said the official, who demanded anonymity. `` We're very happy because he's not going to be the prophet anymore.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> came to power in 1979 vowing to export his revolution throught the Islamic world. His call was taken up by Islamic radicals throughout the Arab world, generating protests and guerrilla action in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and other countries. The bloodiest protests occurred in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, where Khomeini-inspired fundamentalists briefly seized Islam's holiest shrine, the Grand Mosque in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, in 1979, and where Iranian demonstrations led to a bloodbath during the Islamic pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in 1987. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responded to the 1987 clashes by demanding the downfall of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s own Islamic fundamentalist government, which is based on mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Sunni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. The strongest factions are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Iranian-backed militias have called for creating an Islamic republic. Shiite Moslems, the overwhelming majority in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, revere the martyrdom of the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s grandson <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in 680, in an Islamic factional war from which the Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> branches of the faith developed. The Iran-Iraq war itself was preceded by Iranian threats against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s secular socialist government. During the war, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hosted a dissident Iraqi government-in-exile headed by fundamentalist clerics, and it vowed to pursue the conflict until <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and his associates were toppled. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> officials claim they were never worried about a Khomeini-style revolution in their country. But they took strong action against pro-Khomeini forces inside their country, which, like <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, has a Shiite Moslem majority. Shortly before the war broke out in 1980, the Iraqis deported 35,000 ethnic Iranians and executed <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Baqr </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sadr </PERSON>, who had vowed allegiance to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. It also crushed the pro-Khomeini <ORGANIZATION> Dawa </ORGANIZATION> Once the war started, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s Shiites remained loyal.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Friday that its new policy of distancing itself from affairs in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to give the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a larger role does not mean cutting its ties to the people there. Information Minister <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Khasawneh </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will continue paying the salaries of teachers and other administrative officials in the occupied lands and that Palestinians from there could keep their Jordanian passports. <PERSON> Khasawneh </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to give the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> `` a free hand to deal'' with their 40-year-old issue `` does not mean that we are cutting all links with Palestinians.'' The Palestinians' right to `` citizenship and a passport ... could not be changed unless it is the will of its holder,'' the minister added. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Thursday it was ending a five-year, $ 1.3 billion development program for education and other services in the occupied territories started in 1986. <PERSON> Khasawneh </PERSON> also said that all joint Jordanian-Palestinian institutions, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, were under review. <PERSON> Wahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON>, the representative from <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and one of 30 Palestinian members of the 60-member lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said ties between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the occupied lands could never be completely severed. `` Arab summits, international conferences or wishes of some parties can not abolish the sacred unity between the two banks,'' <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON> said. `` I do not support the Jordanian step to withdraw its responsibility toward the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people whatever the reasons were.'' <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON> dismissed reports that the 8-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military occupation had also fueled feelings against <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` People there have deep respect and admiration for King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and his policies,'' he said. The territories have been occupied by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million population is of Palestinian origin, but carry Jordanian passports. A senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to give the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> more responsibility in the occupied lands, `` although clear, does not mean that we are giving up our commitments to <LOCATION> Palestinans </LOCATION> and their issue.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest 13 More Abortion Foes Who Refuse To Give Names</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirteen more anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested Friday and refused to give their names, raising to more than 100 the number of abortion foes jailed in a waiting game of anonymity with authorities. A group called Operation Rescue organized the protest outside the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> SurgiCenter, a clinic where abortions, among other medical services, are performed. The group led a similar protest at the clinic during the Democratic National Convention on July 19, when 134 were arrested. About 96 of the first batch have refused to give their names and remain in jail, identifying themselves as numbered `` Baby Jane Does'' and `` Baby John Does'' _ in solidarity, they say, with aborted fetuses. All pleaded innocent to the only charge against them, criminal trespass, in three days of <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appearances that ended Friday. Those arrested Friday were charged with giving a false name, criminal trespass, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct and are to appear in court Monday. One demonstrator entered the clinic and tried to talk people in the waiting room out of having abortions, but was ushered out by employees. Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said about 75 percent of those jailed vowed to conceal their identities and remain jailed until their appearances in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, if that date is within the next month or so. He said some others would identify themselves in the next few days and sign $ 500 recognizance bonds if business or personal matters required them to leave. Court officials say they can not free unidentified people on bond because there is no way of keeping track of them or assuring that they return for scheduled court appearances. `` We will continue not to provide our identities to break the grip which the abortion industry holds over the criminal justice system in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, director of Operation Rescue.

<HEAD>Columnist Charged Will Illegal Handgun Possession</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, a longtime proponent of strict handgun control, has been charged with unauthorized possession of a weapon and ammunition after shooting a teen-ager who took an unauthorized dip in his backyard pool, court records show. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials denied Friday that they tried to suppress public knowledge of the charges, even though they had told reporters no decision had been reached a day after the paperwork was filed on Wednesday. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 62, allegedly used an unregistered pistol and bullets to shoot a trespasser in his backyard June 14. The youth suffered a wrist wound and was treated and released the same day. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> is scheduled to appear in District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Monday for arraignment on the misdemeanor possession charges, according to court records. If convicted on both counts, the columnist would face a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine. When contacted by a reporter in <LOCATION> Reno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, where he was scheduled to deliver a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> refused to discuss the legal developments. `` My lawyers are doing all the talking. I do n't know all the details yet,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said. District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the city's top attorney, contended that an administrative filing error left him and other top attorneys unaware that the charges had been filed. `` The agreement we reached with Mr. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney was to file charges next week, since he -LRB- <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> -RRB- was out of town,'' said <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>. `` There was never any intent to deceive the press or the public about what was going on.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, confirmed <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>'s account of the matter. Questions remained about the city's delays in handling the case. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was charged nearly six weeks after the incident occurred, while <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> acknowledged that the city usually decides whether to bring charges in such instances within three weeks. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was cleared last month of assault charges in the shooting incident after an investigation by the federal prosecutor's office. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said at the time that he believed <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> deferred that decision to the city, which normally handles such cases. After the shooting incident, pro-gun groups said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was a hypocrite for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice numerous times in his column. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he obtained the weapon only after receiving death threats, and was indirectly misinformed by police about the need to register it. The district's far-reaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that all weapons be registered. But <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, and that his son was told he did not have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he heard noises in his back yard, called police, and then discovered <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and three other youths by his swimming pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after the teen-ager lunged at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> disputed that, saying he had not threatened the columnist and had been shot while trying to flee. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was wounded in the wrist, was treated and released the same day from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He was charged with one count of unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service work. `` My lawyer wo n't let me talk, but there's a lot I'd like to say,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said when told <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> would be charged. Calls to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s attorney were not returned.

 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it has no policy of pulling its editorial punches on <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, even though two major <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspapers have blocked editorial cartoons critical of the attorney general as he nears a decision crucial to the publishing company's bottom line. Editors at the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> acknowledge that they decided against running some cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> while he was considering a proposed agreement by which the Free Press and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, would merge business functions while remaining editorially separate. But other <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> editors across the country said they are not preoccupied with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s pending decision. In fact, one of the papers described <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in an editorial as `` a boob.'' The editors also said they have received no corporate directive on the issue. The partner in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> deal, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it has not tried to guide its papers on covering <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` We have not, and do not, offer guidance to our papers on editorial matters,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Overby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> vice president for news, said Thursday. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said the pending <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> decision has not affected his newspaper's editorial page content. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinks </PERSON>, senior vice president for news and operations at <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said Thursday that corporate interference in editorial coverage would be out of character for the newspaper group, winner of multiple Pulitzer prizes and owner of 30 daily newspapers in 16 states. `` I do n't tell people what to put on their editorial pages,'' he said. `` It's a fundamental article of faith that we do n't dictate editorial page policy from the corporate level.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has agreed to decide, before he leaves office next month, the fate of an application from <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> to merge the business functions of the two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers. Under the Newspaper Preservation Act, the attorney general has the power to grant special antitrust exemptions to failing newspapers by eliminating competition for advertising, as long as each paper preserves its editorial independence. <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> Editor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said he decided to ask <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> cartoonist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> not to draw cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> while the decision is considered. <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> said he has confined the newspaper's commentary on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to the written word rather than political cartoons, because `` a cartoon ca n't say ` on the other hand.''' Free Press Editor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON>, who decided against running several cartoons by staff cartoonist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, has said, `` We're walking through a situation in which you ca n't deal with things as freely as you can with a situation in which there is no vested interest. <PERSON> Stroud </PERSON> noted the Free Press has carried <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> editorials at `` all the key points'' during the period in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has fought allegations of financial improprieties and unethical behavior. Another <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, has published nine editorials on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and a dozen <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> cartoons since the beginning of the year. The cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were often uncomplimentary, and one depicted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a dilapidated, rat-infested building. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiff </PERSON>, editor of The <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Democrat, said his paper has run numerous cartoons and editorials about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, `` all critical of him.'' Both The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> papers, have been critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in editorials and editorial cartoons in 1988 and neither has withheld cartoons on the attorney general, according to editorial page editors. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, deputy editor for the editorial pages at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said the paper has run eight editorials highly critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, including one referring to the attorney general as a `` boob.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' editorial page editor, <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, said his paper's coverage of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is `` no holds barred'' and has gotten no corporate directives. `` I think I'd go to the wall on something like that,'' he said. `` An editorial cartoon is n't supposed to be fair.'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, editorial page editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, said he runs the work of three syndicated cartoonists, and two have done fairly regular cartoons about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` We've taken the position he's not done a good job of keeping out of trouble. We'll continue to make our judgments on things entirely unrelated to -LRB- the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> decision -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, editor of The <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- Ledger-Enquirer, has not pulled <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> cartoons either. `` We have no such policy,'' <PERSON> Swift </PERSON> said. `` We've had no communication or conversation with anyone from <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> about it, and we're doing basically what we feel is best for our readers.''

 A state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidate who drove his imported car to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> meeting has only himself to blame for losing the endorsements of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s two major labor groups, a union spokesman says. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, complained earlier this week that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> coerced leaders of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> to support his hand-picked successor, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Profit </PERSON>, over <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> in a primary election despite a decision by the group's local members to remain neutral But <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>'s admission to a <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> local screening committee that he owns a Subaru and his wife drives a Mercedes killed any chance he had of winning labor support `` That's the first thing they do is look out the window and see what you drive,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, chuckling. `` Somebody who thinks that little of workers in their district that they're driving a foreign car is not going to get their endorsement,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, insisting that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s preference never came into play. `` If God himself endorsed -LRB- <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> -RRB-, and he drove up in a Subaru, he's not getting our endorsement,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON> said he's not surprised the union is using his choice of cars against him, but he has borrowed an American-made car for the rest of the campaign. `` If that's the only thing that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and company can find in terms of a negative about <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, I accept that.''

<HEAD>Farm Prices Up 3.6 Percent For Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products in July rose 3.6 percent from June as drought continued to take a toll of crop and livestock production, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that higher prices for corn, soybeans and eggs contributed most to the July increase. Lower prices for oranges, cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities. Compared with a year earlier, July prices averaged 10 percent higher. The report also included revised figures showing that the index rose only 2.2 percent in June, compared with the preliminary reading of 3.7 percent announced a month ago. Department projections earlier this month showed that 1988 grain production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year. Heat and drought have dried up pastures and forced many producers to thin out herds to cut down on rising feed costs. Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buche </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the July report did not reflect most of the recent downturn in feed grain and soybean prices after rains improved harvest prospects from earlier in the month. However, the market continued to be highly volatile. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, crop futures soared after falling for nine straight sessions as processors and other users came into the market. By the market's close, most corn and soybean futures had risen their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents per bushel, while the limitless August contract for soybeans soared more than 34 cents. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report, which uses prices at the farm level, showed that as a commodity group, prices of feed grains and hay _ in great demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas _ rose 16 percent from June to July, averaging 71 percent above a year ago. Prices of food grains, mostly wheat but also including rice, rose 2.9 percent during the month and averaged 54 percent more than in July 1987. Oil-bearing crops, mostly soybeans, were up 8.5 percent from June and averaged 57 percent more than a year ago, the report said. Overall the July all-crops price index was up 7.1 percent from June, averaging 26 percent above the year-ago level. The July livestock price index was unchanged from June but was down 0.7 percent from July 1987. Lower prices for cattle and hogs were offset by higher prices for eggs, broilers and turkeys. Prices of cattle and calves continued to edge lower, partly due to many farmers and ranchers being forced by drought to sell animals to slaughter plants or feedlots. Beef cattle, generally, fell to an average of $ 63.60 per hundredweight in July, down $ 1.40 from June. The price index for poultry and eggs, collectively, rose 19 percent from June to July and averaged 32 percent more than a year ago. Although the projections are subject to review as more is known about 1988 crop and livestock production, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say now that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 53 billion to $ 59 billion this year, down from the record level of $ 56 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. The report also included new quarterly figures showing that farm production costs in July were up 2.4 percent from April, averaging 4.9 percent more than in July 1987. Higher prices for feed and gasoline were only partially offset by lower prices for feeder livestock. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 63.605.20 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, down from $ 65 in June but up from $ 61.10 reported for July 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 44.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 47.10 in June and $ 59.60 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.89 a bushel, was up from $ 2.41 in June and the average of $ 1.60 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.46 per bushel, compared with $ 3.36 in June and $ 2.32 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.35 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 7.29 in June and $ 3.49 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 8.87 per bushel, compared with $ 8.14 in June and $ 5.25 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 60.7 cents per pound, compared with 61.2 in June and 68.3 cents in July 1987 _ Eggs were 57.8 cents per dozen, compared with 45.7 cents in June and 50.3 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 11.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.30 in June and $ 12 a year earlier _ Broilers were 42.1 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 36.7 cents in June and 27.6 cents a year ago

<HEAD>Senate Votes To Increase Spending on Nutrition Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday approved a $ 31 million increase in the government's nutrition program for women, infants and children as part of a $ 47 billion measure to pay for agriculture, nutrition and rural development programs for the year beginning Oct. 1. The lawmakers voted 87-4 to boost money for the popular WIC program as they worked through a list of amendments to the overall spending measure, and made up the cost by trimming spending from a whole spectrum of farm programs. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., who proposed the increase, said it would provide benefits to nearly 100,000 eligible poor women and children who now are left out of the program because of funding limits The bill would provide about $ 1.9 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> WIC </ORGANIZATION> program for the coming year, an increase of about $ 125 million over the current year's level, and $ 31 million more than had been recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for next year. To stay within spending limits for the overall bill, the increase in <LOCATION> WIC </LOCATION> was paid for with a 0.7 percent across-the-board cut on farm programs in the bill. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> argued that while the program provides food supplements to about 3.6 million low-income pregnant and nursing mothers and young children, at least that many more are not served because the program is underfunded. Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., the senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member on the agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, argued against the change, noting that participation in the program has grown 79 percent since 1980 and that it already `` is funded in a very generous way. He said it would be unfair to other farm programs to impose further cuts in order to boost <ORGANIZATION> WIC </ORGANIZATION> spending. The WIC program is popular _ particularly in an election year _ because it targets one of the most vulnerable groups in the population and by providing preventive care helps save money on later health-care costs. It provides packages of fortified infant formula, milk, cereal, cheese, eggs and fruit juices through local health clinics. The money bill, passed on a 74-8 final vote, now goes to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to work out differences between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version and one passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on June 16. The House bill makes available $ 3 billion less than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. Among differences between the two versions is a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision putting a $ 250,000 cap on loans to honey producers, some of whom collect large federal payments for selling their surplus honey to the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> dropped that provision from its bill. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is opposed to the overall spending bill on numerous grounds, and the president's top advisers have vowed to recommend a veto if it is not changed before being sent to the White House. Among its objections, the administration lists a provision that requires the government to base its cost-benefit calculations for irrigation projects on the subsidized value of surplus crops that will be grown on the irrigated land, rather than the value of the crops before subsidies. The requirement produces a double subsidy problem which the administration has been trying to eliminate, according to a statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. The bill also reinstates a list of programs the administration has sought to eliminate, including rural housing loans and grants and agricultural research and extension programs. Among its provisions, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill makes available: _ $ 12.5 billion for farm programs, including crop subsidies, crop insurance, agricultural research and extension. _ $ 12.4 billion in rural development programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loans, reimbursements to the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and soil conservation programs. _ $ 16.2 billion for domestic food assistance, including $ 13.4 billion for the food stamp program, $ 4.6 billion for child nutrition and $ 50 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. _ $ 1.2 billion for foreign programs including <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> and subsidies to encourage exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. _ $ 534 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and $ 35.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>To Review Cases of People Imprisoned During Anti-communist
Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The cases of about 400 people imprisoned during the 1956 anti-Communist uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks will be reviewed by the end of August, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. The reviews could lead to amnesty and permission to travel abroad for some of the 400. But <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON>, head of the ministry's legislation drafting department, also was quoted by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> as saying those who were convicted of high treason or espionage for their acts between Oct. 23, 1956, and May 1, 1957 would be excluded from the planned amnesty. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> said amnesty would not be considered for those convicted of committing common crimes such as homicide, robbery and `` acts causing danger to the public'' during that period, the newspaper reported. The revolt began in October 1956 with demonstrations demanding a new government and that Soviet troops leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. On Nov. 4, 1956, about 4.2 million Soviet troopers and 2,500 tanks struck at <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, premier and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, said last week during a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit that his government was preparing a measure to remove travel restrictions for those sentenced for having played a role in the uprising. He said the proposal could affect 400 people. Police can deny exit visas to people who have a criminal record. Hungarians generally have greater freedom of travel under regulations approved Jan. 1. They allow passport holders to travel to the West as often as they can afford within the country's currency restrictions Seven dissidents went on a hunger strike last week, however, to protest what they said were arbitrary decisions by police over who receives a passport. Most of the hunger strikers have been refused permission to travel abroad for allegedly violating Hungarian regulations on previous trips. <PERSON> Jenoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonay </PERSON>, one of the hunger strikers, was involved in the 1956 revolt and could be affected by the new ruling. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said that among the cases to be reconsidered would be those of people who had been refused amnesty earlier because of political affiliation with the leaders of the 1956 uprising. But <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has steadfastly ruled out rehabilitation of the leaders of the revolt, including <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> who was the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader at the time. His trial and execution were announced in 1958. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> said those who were sentenced to five-year prison terms or less following the uprising were given amnesties after their release in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Those who served more than five years will have to apply for the invalidation of their criminal record, he said. About 20,000 people jailed during and after the revolt were released in a general amnesty in 1962.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Friday of permitting the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s procurement scandal and said if he is elected `` we're not going to surrender our national security to greed and corruption.'' `` We're not going to use our defense dollars to line the pockets of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultants,'' the Democtratic presidential nominee said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, visiting the state where he suffered the worst embarrassment of his primary campaign, toured a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> truck assembly plant to underscore his pledge to work for `` full employment'' and his call for private and government investment in modernizing industry and creating new jobs. He also met with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters who had helped <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> win the state last spring. He got outspoken backing from one key figure. At the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant, where Chevrolet and GMC light trucks are manufactured, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> walked along the assembly line to shake hands with workers. He climbed behind the wheel of a new red, four-wheel drive truck and drove it off the assembly line, carrying with him <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s two senators, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>. As he had done in other cities a day earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met privately with leaders of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s former campaign _ an organization that produced a two-to-one <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> victory over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s hybrid caucus system. `` I want them; I need them; I want them to be a part of not only a great campaign but what I hope will be a great administration,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He met twice with <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Furguson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state chairman, who voiced support for the Dukakis-Lloyd <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ticket. `` Our entire organization is ready to plug in and go,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. The candidate also met with the state's top Democrats, including <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>, one of the few black elected leaders who backed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the primaries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to 500 people outside another <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plant, where Buicks are assembled, cited the report on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement practices conducted for the administration by a commission headed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>. He said the report indicated the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had helped create a climate where `` honest and efficient military acquisition is impossible.'' `` In a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, we're not going to surrender our national security to greed and corruption,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. In the plant, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted warmly by workers and presented a maroon jacket with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> name and `` Duke for President'' embroidered on the back. `` We want good jobs and these are the kinds of jobs we want for the people of this country, to make our industrial base and manufacturing industries competitive again,'' he said. The rally was in the same town where another <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> auto assembly was closed within the past year, leaving more than 3,000 people out of work. Both <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and another primary rival, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, had traveled to that closed <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> plant for speeches last spring. Asked what hope he could offer the laid-off workers, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited his plan to spend half a billion dollars investing in economic development in distressed regions of the country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his criticism of the administration's handling of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts later in <LOCATION> Sturtevant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where he toured a plant that makes metal casings for auto transmissions and other machinery. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his criticism of the administration's handling of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contracts later in <LOCATION> Sturtevant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisc. </LOCATION>, where he toured a plant that makes metal casings for auto transmissions and other machinery, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to about 300 people in the parking lot of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> plant, where he said that bringing labor and management together will be a `` major challenge to me if I'm president.'' About 25 anti-abortion and other demonstrators chanted protest slogans for much of his speech.

<TEXT>
 `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>,'' the critically praised series dropped by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for low ratings, is moving next year to the <ORGANIZATION> Lifetime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, Lifetime announced Friday. `` Molly Dodd'' was nominated Thursday for three Emmy Awards, including <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for best lead actress in a comedy. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fili </PERSON>, Lifetime's senior vice president of programming, called `` Molly Dodd'' `` the perfect show for us.'' Lifetime is geared toward female viewers. `` Molly Dodd'' is a bittersweet comedy about a divorced woman in her late 30s living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We expect this show will flourish in its move from network to its new home on cable where the talent will have more creative freedom and less restrictions,'' said <PERSON> Fili </PERSON>. In January, Lifetime will begin airing the 26 episodes already produced and has contracted for 13 new episodes that will begin running in the spring. The acquisition marks the first time since the <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> continued production of `` Airwolf'' two years ago that cable has continued production on a show canceled by a network. Lifetime's purchase of `` Molly'' is significant in view of the decline in network ratings and higher cable viewership. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, the creator and executive producer of the show, said he was thrilled that the show would stay in production. `` Lifetime is doing something that could be very revolutionary, could signal a new age in television for the creative community,'' said <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>. `` It's another place to go, and there should be other places to go, because this is a show that a lot of people wanted to watch and the network said there just were n't enough people.'' <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> had been critical of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>'s taste in programming after <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> moved the show around the schedule and complained about its low ratings. But <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> avoided criticizing <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> anew. `` I think he's one of the most intelligent men in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> said, getting a big laugh from TV critics attending the news conference. `` I said some things when all this was going on at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> because I was very upset about what had happened, but it all had to do with the emotion of the moment,'' he said. <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> also produced `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. It was dropped after a season. An earlier <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> co-production, `` <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,'' became a cult hit in reruns on cable. It too received critical praise on the network, but was canceled due to low ratings. <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> said he had to be convinced that a move to cable was worthwhile, but is now sold on the idea. `` This could be the answer for people like me,'' he said. `` Maybe cable is exactly where we should be. ` Frank's Place' -LRB- on CBS -RRB- got nine Emmy nominations, but last week it was 72 -LRB- in the Nielsen rankings -RRB-. `` I do n't want ` <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>' to die, and this looks like genuine life to me.'' <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> said the show would be produced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and that production would resume in January. The show is unaffected by the writers' strike because the production company has an independent contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was shooting a movie in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and he had not talked to her but `` I think she feels the same way I do'' about moving the show to cable.

 An organization of Iranian guerrillas fighting to overthrow <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said Friday it had held two towns in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for three days this week and killed or wounded 40,000 troops loyal to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> is now withdrawing from the towns of <LOCATION> Islamadab </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Karand </ORGANIZATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Aladin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pouran </PERSON>, a representative of the year-old organization. In three days of fighting, the <ORGANIZATION> NLA </ORGANIZATION> forces caused 40,000 casualties, and shot down two F-4 Phantom jets and two Cobra helicopter gunships, <PERSON> Pouran </PERSON> told a news conference. `` Heavy fighting continued incessantly until Friday morning between <ORGANIZATION> NLA </ORGANIZATION> forces and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Revolutionary Guards at different points along the front, from the border region to the <LOCATION> Islamabad-Kermanshah </LOCATION> highway,'' <PERSON> Pouran </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> called for restraint by all parties in the conflict. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NLA </ORGANIZATION>, formed in June 1987 as the military arm of the <LOCATION> Mojaheddin </LOCATION>, operates with the support of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and seeks the violent overthrow of the Iranian government. `` Our view is that peace will require that both sides refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the other,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Once again, the spokesman sidestepped questions about <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` Both sides have indicated that they seek a negotiated settlement, but getting there is going to require patience and flexibility,'' he said. `` We have been in close contact with the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Secretary-General and with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to lend our support to this process, and will continue to do that.''

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision against addressing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> next week is a `` serious miscalculation'' that could hurt him among black voters, the president of the group said Friday. `` I believe it is a critical error on the part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign to not come and address this group,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` We did not offer the invitation because we needed someone to come fill up a slot.

The 5,000 largely middle class and affluent blacks gathering for the league's annual conference will hear from Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday night and from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Congressman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who sought the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plled away from the field during the primaries, is part of a Tuesday night panel discussion on the 1988 election. `` I would not care to characterize it as an insult,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's action. `` We believe it is important to anyone who in 1988 believes that he will occupy the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to recognize that the black vote is critical to that. Obviously the people who were advising the vice president and the vice president himself disagree with that.'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, did not return two phone calls seeking comment. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said the profile of the average league member _ characterized as a 34-to-54 year old college-educated black, earning at least $ 30,000 a year _ made the league a good forum for a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The league itself is non-partisan. `` You've got to appreciate the profile because if there are any black folks in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who just might be sensitive to giving an audience to the vice president, it would be a group with this profile,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` The fact that they do not have an appreciation for this profile not only sends a message to this group but it sends even a greater message to the group that does n't fit that profile. `` It's in his best interest to present his case to black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` The fact that he obviously feels he can get elected without it I think is a serious miscalculation on his part.''

 A human rights lawyer accused the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Friday of setting up Mariel Cuban detainees for unfair treatment with a proposal that immigration judges be allowed to ignore evidence of persecution in some asylum cases. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the proposal appears to be an effort to expedite denial of asylum to the Mariel Cubans, many of whom have criminal records in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under the proposed regulation, judges would not need to inquire into the nature of a `` well-founded fear of persecution'' in the home country of an asylum applicant who had committed a `` particularly serious crime'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the serious crimes include murder, drug trafficking, armed robbery and rape. But <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> said refugees with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convictions for burglary, weapons possession, simple assault and marijuana possession could be affected too. <PERSON> Helton </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asylum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. About 2,600 Cubans, mostly criminals and mental patients, sent by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in a 1980 boatlift from the port of Mariel are detained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Nearly 1,500 are being held in federal prisons, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The real target of this proposal seems to be the Cuban Marielitos who remain in immigration custody,'' said <PERSON> Helton </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to expedite the denial of any asylum applications filed by the Cubans, many of whom have criminal histories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so that they can be deported quickly back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' The proposal is `` absolutely not targeted at'' the <ORGANIZATION> Mariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubans </ORGANIZATION>, although `` it would have application to some Mariels,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a deputy assistant attorney general in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil division. The regulation was prompted by an 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> opinion, not by the prospect of Mariel Cubans seeking asylum, <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said. `` The basic purpose is the prevention of unnecessary delays in the removal of all aliens regardless of nationality who have committed particularly serious crimes,'' said <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>. The cases of the 2,600 Cubans are being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether to release them or to detain them. About 70 Cuban detainees have been served with deportation notices, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, a lawyer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> who has represented many of the Mariel Cubans. Filing an asylum application is one step to avoid being repatriated to a home country. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Dec. 31 that under an existing <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulation, asylum applicants are entitled to present their evidence and to have their claim of persecution considered by immigration judges in deportation and exclusion proceedings, despite the fact that the applicants may have serious criminal convictions. The new proposal, which is open for public comment until Aug. 26, would close that opportunity. The 11th circuit case, <PERSON> Arauz </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, involved a Nicaraguan man who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. He had been arrested aboard a fishing vessel carrying more than 4,000 pounds of marijuana. The proposal also would cover refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution who have participated in the persecution of others or who pose a danger to the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The proposal is part of a comprehensive rule-making which involves revamping asylum procedures in line with a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> versus <ORGANIZATION> Cardoza-Fonseca </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to complete the comprehensive rule-making later.

 With mixed feelings of warmth and caution, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Jews welcomed the first Israeli diplomats to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 21 years to <LOCATION> Sabbath </LOCATION> prayers at sundown Friday. `` Shalom!'' shouted the burly, bearded delegation head, <PERSON> Meron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, as he and the five other Israelis met a crowd of 60 Jews and reporters outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Choral Synagogue. The Soviet Jews replied with shouts of shalom, a Hebrew word that means both hello and peace. The diplomats, four of them Soviet-born, flew to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Thursday for a two-month visit. They are to inspect the former <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and review the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s processing of requests by Soviet Jews for Israeli visas. It is the first such mission to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1967, when the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> broke relations with the Jewish state to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territories in the 1967 Middle East War. Inside the synagogue, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 41, who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1957, chatted in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Shayevich </PERSON>. `` This is really special for us,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> told journalists. `` Every synagogue for us is the crucial point, the crossroads where the Jewish community meets.'' He and the other Israelis, wearing the traditional skullcap, the yarmulke, took seats for Sabbath prayers. Many of the Soviet Jews said they learned of the planned visit to the synagogue from radio newscasts on <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Several Soviet Jews outside the synagogue on central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arkhipova </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> told reporters Friday night that they want to emigrate A 28-year-old man who identified himself only as <PERSON> Arya </PERSON> said he had `` warm feelings'' toward the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> visitors, but was concerned they had come in part to enforce a new Israeli policy limiting the options of Jews who want to leave. The Israeli Cabinet ordered a change in procedure in June that would force most emigrating Soviet Jews to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Under current rules, most emigres can choose where they want to resettle, and most go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arya </PERSON> said he just received Soviet permission to emigrate with his wife and 2-year-old daughter, and might prefer some other country than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in which to settle. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernobylsky </PERSON>, a prominent refusenik, or Soviet Jew refused permission to emigrate, told a reporter he doubted the Israeli diplomats would push for freer emigration. `` They are afraid of Soviet authorities and want to please them,'' he said. <PERSON> Shayevich </PERSON>, who some Jews say is under the tutelage of the government, told reporters he believes most Soviet Jews who want to leave have already emigrated. He said the Soviet government has a legitimate right to force people to stay if they had access to classified material. From January to June, 6,017 Soviet Jews emigrated. Last year, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> allowed 8,011 Jews to leave. The rabbi said he hoped the Israeli mission would lead eventually to restoration of diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> says it wo n't restore ties until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws from the occupied lands and agrees to an international <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference.

 There were 107.9 million head of cattle on the nation's farms and ranches as of July 1, the lowest count since mid-year inventories were started in 1973, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The latest total was down 1 percent from 109.5 million head a year earlier and 4 percent fewer than the 112.2 million of two years ago. Although drought has forced some producers to thin out herds because of poor forage supplies and high feed costs, the cattle herd has been shrinking for six years. Last Jan. 1, for example, the inventory dropped to 99 million head, a 27-year low and the first time that the Jan. 1 count had been less than 100 million since 1961. Officials said the 1988 calf crop is expected to be about 40.2 million head, up fractionally from 1987 but down 2 percent from 1986. The July 1 inventory of 107.9 million head _ which includes calves and dairy cattle as well as beef stock _ included these categories, compared with the last two years, respectively: _ Beef cows, 33.8 million head, down 1 percent from both July 1, 1987, and 1986 _ Milk cows, 10.3 million, down 1 percent from last year and 6 percent below two years ago _ All heifers, 500 pounds and over, 16.5 million, down 3 percent from last year and 6 percent from two years ago _ Beef replacement heifers, 4.8 million, unchanged from both years _ Milk replacement heifers, 4.4 million, down 4 percent from 1987 and down 6 percent from 1986 _ Other heifers, 7.3 million, down 4 percent from 1987 and down 9 percent from 1986 _ Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 14.5 million, down 2 percent from last year and down 5 percent from 1986 _ Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.2 million, unchanged from both years _ Calves under 500 pounds, 30.7 million, down 1 percent from 1987 and down 5 percent from 1986

<TEXT>
 Farmers who have grain price support loans coming due on July 31 will have an option to extend them to Aug. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Officials said the action was taken as a result of a preliminary injunction issued July 21 by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaughlin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. However, they left the door open for a possible appeal of the court's order. The court order barred the secretary of agriculture from implementing notices issued by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to county offices concerning the extension of loans and whether or not certain commodities would be eligible for storage in the agency's farmer-owned reserve program. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedenbaugh </PERSON>, acting executive vice president of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said all terms and conditions of the individual contracts will remain the same. Producers who have reserve contracts, special storage loan contracts and 1985 and 1986 extended loan contracts will continue to earn storage payments through Aug. 31, he said. The payments for the additional month's storage will be made when farmers settle their loans. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bedenbaugh </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are `` examining possible courses of action which could be taken in this litigation.'' He said the one-month extension of all loans was `` to alleviate any confusion among producers and in the commodity markets'' that might have been caused by the court's injunction.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Friday that Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been slow to recognize the need for more child care, but he also said the vice president's proposal on the subject was `` a step in the right direction.'' That was a kinder verdict than Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave during a news conference while campaigning in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, `` I do n't know of anyone who is seriously concerned about child care who thinks that makes sense.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> flew back to his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to complete a three-day campaign swing, his first solo tour since receiving his nomination last week at the Democratic National Convention. With a rally and news conference in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, he was campaigning hard on the home turf of his Senate-race opponent, Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. He told reporters he was going `` full bore'' on both of his candidacies and intended to spend all the money he raised for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race on that contest, despite Republican complaints that it was unfair. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law allows <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to run for both offices at once. Earlier Friday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> visited a state-subsidized day care center at the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> campus, posing with pre-schoolers and listening to parents' and employees' questions about why there was not more federal day care help. One mother getting her degree in education told him that her `` whole eight years of education is more or less down the drain'' until her child is old enough to go to school, since she wo n't be able to afford day care once she leaves the campus program. `` We're beginning to make some headway. We're really beginning to see some attention given to this issue,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, citing his involvement last year in creating a commission to study children's issues in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters afterward that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had fought him last year when he earmarked $ 50 million for federal day care subsidies to local government. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 2.2 billion proposal amounted to a `` conversion.'' `` I think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal is a step in the right direction and I'm delighted to see them get aboard on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reviews any changes in tax law. `` They have not been very supportive of these kinds of efforts over the past eight years.'' Asked if he supported the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan's tax credits to mothers who stay home with their children, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> declined to comment, saying he was n't familiar with the details. He pointed out that Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., had drafted a competing plan with subsidies and standards for day care centers <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he supports the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats' legislation in principle. The <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> center, available for students and employees of the university, is heavily subsidized with parents paying part or none of the cost depending on their income. The center has an annual budget of $ 650,000 and there are 77 youngsters enrolled, said administrator <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Menninger </PERSON>. The most a parent pays is $ 440 a month, which is less than two-thirds the cost for care at the center which is just off Sunset Blvd. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> predicted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would eventually approve a blend of the different child care proposals, including some tax credits and some subsidies. Sen. and Mrs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who have three children and five grandchildren, spent about 15 minutes with the children, some of whom were frightened by the media commotion. Others seemed to enjoy the scene. The 67-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, dressed in a suit suitable for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, bounced a boy on his knee, telling him `` Ride-em, <PERSON> Cowboy </PERSON>.'' He also got close-up looks at a wide variety of plastic dinosaurs. On another subject, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> who has been widely reported as the next <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary if and when <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> leaves that job to take over as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he expected there would be little opposition to <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose nomination would have to be cleared by his committee. Though <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is still in his job and no nomination of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> has been announced, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke as if the changes had been put in motion. `` I think that's a good choice,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> served in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He was appointed to that job and served there a few months, made a lot of friends. I'm very pleased to see the choice. He's a man who has broad experience in the area and I think will bring a lot to the job.''

 A cancer patient who said he must smoke marijuana to avoid starvation was convicted Friday of possessing 7 -LCB- ounces of marijuana, but jurors fined him only $ 1 and ordered no jail time. The <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury followed the recommendation of Assistant County Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, who had urged them to show compassion. The maximum penalty that could have been levied was 90 days in jail and a $ 250 fine. The trial that began Thursday was the first time a cancer patient has mounted a medical defense against a marijuana charge, although people suffering from glaucoma and other disorders have done so, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeese </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 31, was a truck driver who weighed nearly 200 pounds in March 1987 when doctors detected a large tumor wrapped around his brain stem, said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Pillersdorf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' attorney. His weight dropped below 125 pounds by the time therapy concluded, he said.

 Sinhalese extremists set buses afire and attacked government buildings Friday, the first anniversary of a pact intended to end an ethnic war with Tamil rebels. Authorities said at least 15 people were killed. Military officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said at least 13 of the dead were Sinhalese militants shot by police during the attacks in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The officers can not be identified under briefing rules. Extremists killed a soldier in the <LOCATION> Hambantota </LOCATION> district of the south and a civilian was slain in an attack on a tavern, they said. Most shops, offices and businesses in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> closed Friday because the owners feared violence, police said. A round-the-clock curfew was imposed in the south after Sinhalese nationalists called for a general strike to protest the Indian-sponsored accord aimed at ending the Tamil war, which has taken more than 8,000 lives in five years. Residents of <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, a city about 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said by telephone that Indian soldiers had put a curfew on parts of the north and east to guard against attacks by Tamil separatist guerrillas. The main Tamil rebel group and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, extremists from the island's Sinhalese majority, oppose the peace agreement signed by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> last July. It offers Tamils limited autonomy. Sinhalese radicals say the deal gives Tamils too many concessions and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> say it is not enough. When the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> continued fighting, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent soldiers in October to enforce the agreement. At least 50,000 now are on the island. A firebomb wounded a railroad engineer as his train pulled into <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, a police officer said. He said Sinhalese extremists set at least eight government buses ablaze. Electricity was cut off in at least four southern towns after the extremists blew up electricity transformers Thursday night, officials said. Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> and control the government and military. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in trying to settle the Tamil war because it is the region's major power, is an overwhelmingly Hindu nation and has a <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> minority of 60 million in southern <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state, just across the <LOCATION> Palk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>.

 The scriptwriters' strike will delay <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>'s fall preview issue three weeks, and even then the weekly magazine's top-selling issue may not be up-to-date, the editor said Friday. `` This may be the year <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION> does a new-season issue and there's no new season,'' said Editor <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON>. The 21-week strike by scriptwriters has halted <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production and jeopardized the fall television season. Negotiators for the scriptwriters and the television and film producers engaged in contract talks this week under a news blackout. Last year's TV Guide fall preview issue sold more than 18 million copies. The magazine, based in suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, has a circulation of 16.4 million, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Julianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. The fall preview issue offers one-page glances at the networks' new programs, with photographs of key characters and comments on the story lines Delays in getting the photographs and information for the stories have pushed the publication from Sept. 10 to Oct. 1. `` We're going to do the best we can _ we're going up to the last minute,'' <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said. `` We could get caught.'' Television casts and crews are usually producing new episodes at this time, making it easy for photographers to get the pictures they need, <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said. But with production halted by the strike, magazine staff members have been forced to find props and set up many of the shots that would typically be taken in a studio, <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said. Things also have been difficult for the magazine's senior editor, <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> <PERSON> Callum </PERSON>, who writes all the show summaries for the preview section. <PERSON> Callum </PERSON> begins writing about new falls shows in the spring after watching the pilot episodes. For the preview issue, he reviews scripts made available by the networks, but this year there are no writers _ and no scripts _ to help him with his writing. Viewers are usually bombarded with 20 or more new shows at the beginning of the season, but <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said some of the shows slated for the preview issue may never make it to television this fall because of the strike. The magazine will be able to make changes in the preview issue up to its Sept. 7 deadline. After that, the new fall lineup of shows is set on paper, whether or not the programs ever make it on the air. In the meantime, the magazine's Sept. 3 issue is a `` survivor's guide'' offering `` the best you can do'' for fresh programming in September and October, <PERSON> Sendler </PERSON> said Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> have been on strike since March 7. Issues in the impasse are payments for reruns of one-hour television shows rebroadcast domestically and all shows rebroadcast overseas.

<HEAD>FCC Ordered To Reconsider Rules For `Indecent' Broadcasts</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> must reconsider an order that broadcasters can only air programs with `` indecent'' content from midnight to 6 a.m., a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The ruling said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> failed to make a case for those specific hours, but _ in a victory for the agency _ affirmed its right to regulate programming to protect children. The unanimous three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also upheld the commission's definition of indecent material on radio and television. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said after the ruling, `` I intend to respond promptly to the court's question regarding those specific times by recommending the initiation of a commission proceeding.'' The commission's midnight-6 a.m. policy, adopted in 1987, was a change from a 1978 policy which only allowed programs with indecent material to be aired on television or radio from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> made the switch because it believed many children were still awake between 10 p.m. and midnight. Broadcasters, program suppliers and public interest groups challenged the new time restraint, saying the programs with adult content could only be aired when most listeners were asleep. They said this violated the First Amendment by denying adults access to constitutionally protected material. The petitioners also challenged the definition of indecent programs as too vague. The court said that `` in view of the curtailment of broadcaster freedom and adult listener choice ... the commission failed to consider fairly and fully what time lines should be drawn.'' The judges said that in the three radio shows used as test cases, the commission cited population figures that estimated the number of teens in the total listening audience. There was no indication of the size of the predicted audience for the specific radio stations in question, the court said. `` More troubling, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> ventures no explanation why it takes teens aged 12-17 to be the relevant age group for channeling purposes,'' the court said. The judges noted that in 1976, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> was mainly interested in preventing children under 12 from seeing or hearing the indecent material. `` We agree the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s midnight advice, indeed its entire position on'' the time restriction `` was not adequately thought through,'' the judges said.'' `` Thus, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> must endeavor to determine what ... rule will most effectively promote parental _ as distinguished from government _ control.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said he was `` delighted that the court ... has unquestionably affirmed the commission's authority to regulate the broadcast of indecent material, permitting parents to control their children's access to sexually explicit programs.'' The indecency definition that was upheld was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> from a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. It defines indecent programming as: `` Exposure of children to language ... that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, praised the ruling. She commented, `` The case says it was n't a good idea to close down the window on indecency from 10 o clock to midnight. We think that limits speech important to the public.'' The ruling was written by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>. Concurring were Circuit Judges <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the imprisoned leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and his family were not the targets of an arson attack that destroyed their home, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s attorney asserted Friday Attorney <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> said he had `` an idea'' of what prompted the attack but that he had to honor <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s request that no statement be made. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was not the target, the family was not the target,'' <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> told a news conference after spending the night talking to youths in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, a black township oustide <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had sent a message from <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> saying there should be `` no prosecutions, no witchhunts'' for Thursday's attack on the Mandela home <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 70, is serving a life sentence after being convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. Ayob also disputed a claim by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a businessman from High Point, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who said he had been given power of attorney by the <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION> to protect their interests. The attorney said the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family would not file a complaint with police about the arson attack and would work with community leaders to try to bring peace and avoid reprisals. He called `` laughable'' a report that police were investigating the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' rival guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, may have been involved in the arson. Ayob would not respond to questions about reports by black journalists that teen-agers who guard the Mandela house had been involved in a dispute with students at a nearby high school over a girl. The reports said about 40 youths, including some wearing jackets from the high school, attacked the house after one or more students were beaten by members of the group guarding the home. <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> said the modest four-room bungalow, in which the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family has lived since the 1940s, would be rebuilt and the work was expected to take a few weeks. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, her youngest daughter <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON>, and two grandchildren who lived in the house were away at the time of the attack. Ayob challenged statements by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> who, after visiting <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in prison, announced that he had been given the power of attorney to represent the family's interests worldwide and to prevent concerts and other events from being staged in the Mandela name by people with no connection to the family. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> made the announcement last week outside the prison with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> standing beside him. Ayob read to the news conference a statement he said had been dictated by <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. It said in part: `` Mr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> does not represent the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family's interests in any way.'' It said that at the July 23 meeting with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had `` firmly rejected'' the suggestion that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> be given power of attorney, and said `` any matter related to the family would only be dealt with by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the main guerrilla organization fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-controlled government. <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> said he discussed the issue with Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> Thursday night, after her house burned down, and she agreed to the contents of the statement he released. However, American publicist <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a colleague of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had called him in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and asked him to announce on her behalf, `` It's nonsense what <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> said. Everything he said was exaggerated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, supporting <PERSON> Ayob </PERSON> and saying <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s `` claims are proved as false.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> has known the <ORGANIZATION> Mandelas </ORGANIZATION> for more than two years. He has paid for their eldest daughter, <PERSON> Zenani </PERSON>, and her husband to attend <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He said from his <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hotel room that Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zindzi </PERSON> were with him during the discussion with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in the prison cell and Ayob has no one to corroborate his statement purportedly from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` The family asked me to do something. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has asked me to stop the ripoff of the <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> family name. ... As long as the family wants me to do something about that I will do that with vigor.''

 A sailor who said he dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> because he feared for his life will retake the course that was revamped after the death of a recruit. Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON>, 27, an electronics technician at <LOCATION> Miramar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials made their offer last month, shortly after he talked to the news media about the school. Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died March 2 during a training exercise at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> barred instructors from touching students after an instructor was accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water, causing him to panic and literally die of fright, according to testimony in an investigative hearing. `` My command was n't aware of what I went through,'' <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were real sympathetic and helpful.'' <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON> said he dropped out of the school last summer, three days before graduation, after he nearly drowned during a training exercise called `` sharks and daisies.'' He said he decided to speak out about the experience after <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death. The day of his death, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked, climbed out of the training pool and shouted that he was quitting, but instructors pushed him back in the water where he collapsed and died. A pathologist said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> had a phobia of being dragged under water, which triggered heart failure followed by drowning. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shut down the school a few weeks after the recruit died. A curriculum review resulted in the ban against instructors touching students and abolished the `` sharks-and-daisies'' drill, during which instructors played the roles of panicked air-crash survivors and would randomly put head-holds on students who were trying to rescue them. The student was to pull the instructor under water to break the hold, then place him in a rescue carry. The changes also require students to immediately be removed from a drill if they ask to quit. In the past, instructors would force trainees to complete an exercise before allowing them to withdraw. <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON> said he did n't expect the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to go as far as it did in its curriculum changes. `` I think they're long overdue and they sound great to me,'' he said. <PERSON> Nazzaro </PERSON> said if he passes the course he can reclaim the helicopter anti-submarine warfare rating he lost when he dropped out of rescue swimmer training.

<HEAD>Boeing Running Behind on Delivery of New Presidential Jet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been notified that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is running behind schedule for delivery of the new Air Force One, the jet that carries the president. Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> said Friday that the manufacturer `` had set a goal a long time ago of trying to get delivery'' by Nov. 30. `` But it's a one-of-a-kind'' sort of plane, the spokesman said in a telephone interview. He said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials it was having `` technical difficulties with the installation of wiring bundles and the availability of parts associated with'' the interior wiring. <PERSON> Loughlin </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is going to announce soon `` a new delivery date,'' and administration officials hope the wide-bodied <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jet will be ready in time for some use by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, director of the military office, said presidential aides hope <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> can have the plane ready at least by Jan. 20, 1989, inauguration day. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, would then get to use the new aircraft to fly to their home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Asked if it appeared the aircraft would not be ready by mid-January, <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said, `` Not so far, but everybody's got their fingers crossed.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is building a new hangar kitchen to replace the one at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> that has been used so far to prepare in-flight meals for passengers of the presidential jet. Because the larger <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 will allow the seating of 93 people on the custom-made jet, compared to 69 seats on the existing <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> must have a hangar kitchen capable of turning out as many as 4,000 meals at a time for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and another <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that flies as its backup. The custom-made presidential jet has a private compartment for the chief executive as well as a flying office and separate compartments for aides, guests, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and traveling reporters. <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> acknowledged that it would be unlikely that <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and its traveling companion, the backup <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, would ever need as many as 4,000 meals. But he said that capability is based on a `` worst-case requirement,'' and that it represents the amount of food-serving capacity that would be necessary if 93 passengers aboard each aircraft made a seven-day trip and had three meals per day. <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> said the construction of an enlarged kitchen at the <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base hangar was necessitated by the need to keep a larger volume of meals ready for loading onto the planes. `` You can make the pre-packaged meals in about the same space, but it's storing them that's the problem,'' he said.

<HEAD>West Germany reduces number of low-level military flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is reducing the low-altitude military training flights over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by 2,000 hours a year. Public protests about low-altitude flights have increased because of several accidents involving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> jets on training missions. <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON>, the defense ministser, told reporters he had rescinded an order for the training of jet fighter pilots as bomber pilots, `` eliminating without replacement 1,000 hours of low-level flights.'' Another 1,000 hours of low-altitude training flights are to be moved to a training area at <LOCATION> Decimomannu </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Sardinia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said. Since March 31, five <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 jet fighters have crashed on training flights over West German territory, including three June 29. Fighter jets of the British, French and West German air forces also have crashed in the past four months. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> announced July 5, after a West German F-4 Phantom crashed, that he was making reduction of low-level training flights a priority. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, about 45,000 hours of flight training are carried out by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military units annually over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Military officials have said the flights are necessary to keep pilots at top readiness. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said he hopes to achieve further reductions in domestic flights by West German air force fighters. Training of West German pilots at <LOCATION> Goose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Labrador </LOCATION>, will be increased by about 1,000 hours to 5,000 hours a year in 1990 or 1991, <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> said. He also said he has been in contact with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials to urge them to take all possible measures to reduce the number of low-altitude flights.

 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is for a weaker defense.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> made the comment after a visiting West German conservative leader, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, said at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` Every American president will provide the same policy regardless of who wins'' the presidential election. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, speaking with reporters after a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said, `` The guidelines of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy will remain unchanged.'' However, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We have great differences with the Democratic nominee in terms of defense posture. `` He basically is for a weaker defense and cutting defense, and we are for a strong defense. He is for reducing commitments all around the world, it would seem. So I would simply ask that anyone take a pretty close look at Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' foreign policy and defense policies and they can judge for themselves.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was quick to respond. `` <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> must be consulting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> astrologer on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' position on defense,'' said senior campaign adviser <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is for a strong defense and a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and he is for strengthening alliances like <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the minister-president -LRB- governor -RRB- of <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> and head of the Bavarian branch of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing party, talked to reporters in English. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected Republican presidential nominee, walked up to reporters questioning <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and posed for pictures with the visiting leader. Asked what difference it would make to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> whether he or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> became the next president, he stressed his familiarity with the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` I understand the alliance, I have been part of strengthening the alliance, I have been working for the alliance.'' Asked specifically to comment on <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' view that the election would mean little difference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> `` is a good man and he's my friend. He can say anything he wants here. I do n't want to put him in a difficult position.''

 <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport has become the hub for arms shipments to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region, according to a book that goes on sale Monday. <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, a West German journalist and television writer, says in `` The Illegal German Weapons Business and Its International Entanglement'' that the national airline <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> carried military supplies to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as late as June. Arms and ammunition are brought to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> by foreign transport planes every two months, transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> cargo jets and flown to the gulf, he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport customs office, said Friday no illegal arms were passing through the airport. `` We control strategic goods coming in and passing through. There has never been a case of such illegal wares being transferred,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> accused West German security officials of `` silently tolerating'' illegal arms transfers. He said an Israeli cargo jet landed at the airport last Dec. 29 and customs police provided security while it was unloaded. The cargo included `` electronic spare parts and air-to-air rockets for U.S.-built Iranian air force F-14 and F-15 jet fighters,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. According to the author, the plane also carried supplies for Iranian Hawk air defense artillery batteries and about 80 TOW rockets, and the cargo was transferred to an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet. Citing investigations by Swedish customs officials, and statements from a West German weapons dealer identified as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Beermann </PERSON>, the writer said the weapons were being shipped by a syndicate of several European companies. He said many of the arms moved under false manifests, sometimes as industrial chemicals and hardware. Companies involved are located in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will keep providing aid to Palestinian Arabs through private relief groups while it seeks an explanation from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for abandoning a special development program on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` These projects enhance the well-being and economic development of the Palestinian people,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions this year are expected to total $ 7 million. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> announced on Thursday it was canceling the development program in a move to give more responsibility over the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-held territories to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. A Jordanian statement in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> said the kingdom was taking the step in `` response to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demands.'' The program, which exists largely on paper, is a $ 1.3 billion plan for which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contributed $ 5.5 million in 1986, $ 14 million in 1987 and $ 5.7 million this year. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has contributed about $ 20 million and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> a lesser amount. The plan had the enthusiastic support of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as a means of improving the `` quality of life'' on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and also had the endorsement of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not clear whether the fund would be canceled, turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or operated in some other way. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> avoided any criticism of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision. `` I do n't have any reaction other than to say that we're consulting with the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> regarding the announcement and how it intends to implement the decision,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said He said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> would take up the issue with <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> leaders when he is in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> also will visit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and has urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to meet with him. While King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision was widely interpreted as at least a partial withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was too early to make any analysis. `` I just do n't have any way to further evaluate the impact of the Jordanian decision, and that's why we're going to talk to them about how this decision is going to be implemented,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would keep making contributions if the fund were run by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said: `` Obviously not.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is counting on <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to support a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that would exclude the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> but include Palestinians in a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> have not endorsed the plan, but <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is expected to make a fifth peace-seeking trip to the region in the fall to solicit their support. `` We do n't interpret this announcement that we're talking about as any lessening of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s intention to remain actively involved in the peace process,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said.

 A ransom note left by the kidnapper of an ailing woman indicates the abduction may have been an act of revenge against her wealthy husband, a psychiatrist said. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, 72, was reported missing by her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, Tuesday night shortly before he found the note, which demanded an unspecified amount in ransom and instructed him not to notify police, authorities said. Police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippen </PERSON> said Friday that police would not be making any statements about the case until there is a major development. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> was last seen Tuesday afternoon when she held a bridge party at her <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> home. Her husband found the typewritten note inside the front door. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, 70, is president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s biggest utilities, and is a major stockholder in <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trustmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the state's second-largest financial institution.

His wealth has been estimated at more than $ 100 million. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON>, a psychiatrist called in to analyze the letter and profile the kidnapper, said the note listed several groups as `` being wronged.'' The psychiatrist refused to identify the groups or give further details. The kidnapper `` will tell later how much the family must pay,'' <PERSON> Galvez </PERSON> said. He said the letter promised Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> will be returned to her family if the note is followed. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> suffers from a chronic inflammation of the small intestine that requires daily medication, without which she could die, officials said. Mayor <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Danks </PERSON> said the note was `` very vague and difficult to comply with'' because it made no specific demands of where to send ransom money or how much to send. He said the kidnapper had made no further contact with the family.

 Leftist guerrillas sent a message to a sparsely attended peace conference Friday saying drug traffickers should included in the talks because they cause so many problems in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Neither the government nor any of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s six guerrilla groups was represented at the conference, which the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> sponsored. The government had threatened the rebels with arrest if appeared. Rebels demanded the peace conference in exchange for releasing a former presidential candidate, <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>. He was abducted May 29 by the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, and held for 53 days. Guerrillas and a representative of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> sent messages to the conference. About 60 people attended, including church officials, 20 congressmen and business leaders. The nation's smallest guerrilla group, the Workers' <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a message that drug traffickers should attend `` because they are the main factors of destabilization'' of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> Other guerrilla groups said they would not surrender their weapons as long as the army wages what the insurgents call a dirty war. Hundreds of people have disappeared and death squads have killed more than 800 leftists in three years. Guerrillas also demand that Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Samudio </PERSON> be fired as defense minister and replaced by a civilian. <PERSON> Cardenal </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> said in a speech the rebels must show sincerity in any negotiations arising from the peace conference and `` make some concrete gestures that demonstrate willingness to end bloodshed.'' A cease-fire negotiated with some guerrilla groups in 1982 collapsed over the next two years, with rebels and army blaming each other for truce violations. The army said the guerrillas tricked the government into peace negotiations to give themselves time to recuperate from military setbacks. Barco spokesman <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> said in a message to Friday's conference the boycott does not mean the government refuses to talk with the guerrillas He said talks should lead not to just `` living together with the guerrillas,'' but should have a goal of bringing the rebels `` into the legal political process.'' <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> is <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s adviser on talks dealings with guerrillas and has met several times with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest guerrilla group with an estimated 5,000-10 ,000 combatants In his message, <PERSON> Pardo </PERSON> asked the guerrillas to say what the government would have to do to get them to end 30 years of insurrection. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was released despite the government's refusal to agree to be host for the conference.

 An opposition alliance said Friday it has asked the military to stop officers from campaigning because it compromises the forthcoming presidential referendum. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> told a news conference the coalition delivered a letter to the military junta Tuesday protesting such activity. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of 16 political groups that formed the alliance to promote a `` no'' vote in the referendum. The government plans a yes-or-no ballot in October on a single candidate, who will be nominated at a meeting Aug. 30 of the army, navy, air force and national police commanders. President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72-year-old army commander who seized power in 1973 coup, is expected to be chosen. Several high-ranking officers who favor <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s nomination have been campaigning at public rallies and in military gatherings. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said that `` compromises the legitimacy of the -LRB- electoral -RRB- process.'' <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s Constitution charges the armed forces with ensuring the impartiality of elections. The coalition's letter, copies of which were given to reporters Friday, said `` a significant number of officers, almost all of them from the army, have begun to openly carry out an ostensible political-electoral activity in favor of a ` yes' vote.'' It said the officers also were calling on troops in barracks speeches to support the candidacy of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, `` whom they descibe as the ` supreme leader' or the ` chieftan of the armed forces, with a rhetoric similar to ... that of fascist and other dictatorial regimes.'' The referendum will be the first presidential ballot since a Marxist, <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, won the 1970 electoin. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> overthrew him in September 1973 and <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died in the coup. If a majority votes for the candidate, he will begin an eight-year term in March 1989. If he is rejected, a <LOCATION> Pinochet </LOCATION> is to remain in power until a free election in 1990.

 A federal appellate court panel ruled 2-1 Friday that the nation's space agency must release the audio tapes of the ill-fated Challenger shuttle flight. The ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here affirmed a lower court decision that the tapes should be made public under the Freedom of Information Act. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had refused to give up the tapes, saying release would invade the privacy of families of the seven astronauts who died in the Jan. 28, 1986 disaster. The judges said the tapes can not be held back under a FOIA exemption that permits withholding of `` personnel and medical files and similar files'' that constitute `` a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> cited that exemption in refusing to release the taes, even though it made public written transcripts of the astronauts' conversations <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the tapes contain no new information on the flight. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in the majority opinion that the court had to decide whether the sound of the human voice, communicating non-personal information, should be considered a `` similar file'' that could be withheld. The court concluded, `` a file is not to be considered ` similar' unless at a minimum it contains personal information _ information somehow related to an individual's life `` To call the sound of a human voice ` personal information' distorts the plain meaning and common understanding of the phrase ... As such, the tape recording of the voices of the astronauts ... without more, does not constitute a ` similar file''' that could be withheld <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended that the exemption be designed to protect individuals from injury and embarrassment resulting from unnecessary disclosure of personal information. `` To accept <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s ... argument would be to hold that every tape recording of audible human utterances, regardless of its content, is invariably a similar file because every person's voice is essentially unique,'' the ruling said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> concurred in the opinion. In a dissent, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> argued <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should have a chance to show that the tapes would invade the privacy of the astronauts' families. He said the court could not make such a determination based on the record as it now exists. `` I find it inconceivable that the sound and inflection of a person's voice during the last seconds of his or her life is not information that somehow relates to an individual's life,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said. `` Whatever insights can be gleaned from their voices, whatever inferences can be drawn about their thoughts and feelings at the very moment of their deaths, they are not to be found in that transcript; if they are anywhere, they are in the tape.''

 The government suspended a state-run news program Friday, a newspaper reported, in a strange twist in the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' crackdown on the Nicaraguan press. The Radio Sandino news show `` En Directo'' was suspended for 48 hours for violating communications law, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique published Friday in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. The private news show `` Fabuloso Siete'' said the suspension was ordered because of `` strong criticism'' by the government program of one of the deputy directors of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>. A Radio Sandino newswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the suspension stemmed from a commentary made Thursday by one of the broadcasters of `` En Directo.'' The suspension of a state-run program may represent an effort to project an image of fairness in the government's series of broadcast and newspaper closures. It was the first action against a state-run news organization. The crackdown began after government opponents held a big demonstration July 10 outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Police battled protesters and arrested about 40 people. The next day, the government complained of media coverage and ordered <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> closed. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> reopened Wednesday after its 15-day suspension, but the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station was closed indefinitely. A private news show, `` <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Despertar </LOCATION>,'' was also shut down indefinitely. Another private show, `` El Noticiero,'' broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION>, returned to the air this week after a 48-hour suspension. Also Friday, <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> reported that a group of family members blocked a road Thursday leading to <LOCATION> Masachapa </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, to protest recruitment of youths into military service. The newspaper said the demonstration `` was manipulated by certain individuals.'' La Prensa showed a photograph in its Thursday night edition of special police forces shoving women. The two-year mandatory military service has been bitterly opposed by many Nicaraguans.

 President <PERSON> Zine </PERSON> <PERSON> el </PERSON> <PERSON> Abidine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> opened a congress of the governing party Friday, the first since President-for-Life <PERSON> Habib </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> was ousted nine months ago. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told 2,000 delegates representing the 1.5 million members of the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> they must adapt to a new democratic spirit. `` Only democracy can restore to the citizen his dignity, to the people their sovereignty and to the country its rightful place in the world,'' he said. Changes undertaken since the bloodless Nov. 7 coup are irreversible and will lead to a society of `` rights, liberties and pluralism,'' the president said. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 52, said at the time of the coup that <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> was senile. <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> will be 85 next month and remains under house arrest in a villa at Mornag outside <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. He had ruled ruled this North African nation since its independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> 31 years ago. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a former interior minister, has promised to open the political system, which was monopolized by <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Destourian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party's name was changed earlier this year to the Constitutional Democratic Rally. He told the congress: `` The life of the party, its rules and its programs have repercussions on all public affairs and all aspects of life in our country.'' Representatives of the three legal opposition parties were invited to the opening session of the congress, which ends Sunday. Opposition leaders have said they will be watching to see if steps are taken to separate the power of the party from that of the state. As in the past, the chief of state also is the president of the governing party and the prime minister is the secretary-general. Opposition leaders noted that <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> appointed 125 of the 200 members of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with the others elected by party members. Officials of <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>'s party said up to 80 percent of the delegates are new and this is the first congress they have attended.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Injunction Against Drug-Testing Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge issued a permanent injunction Friday against the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s drug-testing program, under which the agency would test 1,800 employees who are in sensitive law enforcement posts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> initially issued a preliminary injunction, saying mandatory random drug testing can not be justified because the department does not consider drug use to be widespread at the agency. `` It is impossible to argue that mandatory random urinalysis drug testing serves the purpose of deterring illegal drug use by trusted and apparently law-abiding employees,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said in a 14-page opinion granting the preliminary injunction. The judge said the 42 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who sued in an attempt to block the program show `` a strong likelihood of success'' on their claim that compulsory random urinalysis drug testing is an unreasonable search and seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment The government had asserted a critical interest in the security of sensitive and classified law enforcement information and in the integrity and public image of the department. Yet `` given the absence of a drug problem at the Department, it is difficult to see how security of sensitive information, or the integrity and public image of the Department would be much served'' by drug testing, said the judge. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> noted that employees also might embezzle, obstruct justice or accept bribes, but that `` no one could seriously argue that, absent any grounds to suspect misconduct,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would be justified in tapping the employee's telephone, censoring his mail or searching his house. `` Something more than unfounded fears must justify an intrusive search,'' <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> said. `` Even though a relaxed ` reasonableness' standard applies to a search by the government as an employer, such a search must be for a non-investigatory and work-related purpose ... Referring to previous cases, <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> noted that individualized suspicion is `` usually a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan announced late last month, the agency would have started testing in as soon as 60 days. Seven percent of a group of 1,800 employees in positions deemed sensitive would be tested annually. After issuing the preliminary injunction, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought, and was granted, a permanent injunction. The government will ask the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> next week for a stay of the permanent injunction so that the department can proceed with the program, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. It can be more difficult to obtain a stay of a preliminary injunction because the legal question presented in that instance is whether a district judge abused his discretion, which is quite broad. The review of a permanent injunction would examine the merits of the constitutional arguments in the case, a prospect favored by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> had argued Thursday to <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> that `` the whole world is watching,'' including leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel and Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> attorney general, who is representing 42 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who filed sued to stop the program, said the agency `` clearly does not understand the difference between ends and means.''

 At least nine people died of cholera or gastroenteritis in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> on Friday, raising July's death toll from the two diseases to 191, a city health official said.

The city health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 1,027 new cases of the diseases were reported Friday in the city. Meanwhile, in the northern Indian state of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>, 157 people have died in the gastroenteritis and cholera epidemic that has broken out in at least 30 of the state's 57 districts, newspapers said Friday. The deaths raised the number of victims nationwide to 618 since monsoon rains started in late June. Officials blame the epidemic on the contamination of the water supply by rainfall flowing through sewage and uncollected garbage.

<HEAD>New Program To Help Children With Serious Disabilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office announced Friday a new federal program aimed at helping children with serious disabilities to receive additional benefits for care in the home. The idea behind the program to be administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is to allow such children to be with their parents in instances where the family income is too high to qualify these adults for home care expenses under the Supplemental Security Income program. Such care previously has been available to these children only in hospitals, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press office said this had the effect of discouraging parents from `` keeping their families at home.'' The program was developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a part of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, in response to a request that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made last March to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief, which he heads. The problem was brought to the vice president's attention by the family of <PERSON> Kaileigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, a 2-year-old <LOCATION> Methuen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, girl born with Downs Syndrome compounded by heart and respiratory problems. <PERSON> Kaileigh </PERSON>, who was hospitalized for most of her first year of life, was able to return home under a Medicaid program for children, which pays for home care when that care costs no more than institutional care. `` However, when <PERSON> Kaileigh </PERSON> left the hospital, she was notable to retain the Supplemental Security Income payment she had been using for personal needs such as diapers, aspirin and other non-prescription drugs,'' the press office said in a statement. The new program involves states to seek waivers for normal home and community-based care. This would permit, in <PERSON> Kaileigh </PERSON>'s case, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Medicaid program with matching federal funds to reimburse families for extra non-prescription drugs and medical supplies that children could receive free at the hospital. `` Not only will this plan help keep families together by facilitating home care of disabled children and eliminating an incentive to keep them in hospitals, but it is anticipated that states will be able to reduce the total cost of such care by reducing the need for institutionalization,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement.

 A professor convicted of killing and dismembering a teen-age prostitute with a chain saw was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison by a judge who said the educator was `` a Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Franc </PERSON>, 58, whose secret life as a homosexual voyeur was disclosed during his trial, coughed slightly but remained impassive as Superior Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> imposed the maximum sentence. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> described the murder of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, 18, and the dismemberment of his body with a chain saw as `` hideous, cruel and callous.'' Franc was accused of shooting <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, a runaway from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, chopping up the body and distributing it across 200 miles of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Franc said a transient named <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> committed the crime. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was never found. `` Dr. Franc, the one thing that becomes very clear to me is you are two different people,'' said the judge. `` You're the scholar to your colleagues. Your students talk about you as if you were the second coming as a teacher. But none of them talk about what was going on in the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> area of your life.'' Franc, who taught at <ORGANIZATION> Fresno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> until his arrest last August, had maintained an apartment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, some 200 miles away, where he paid young men to pose for nude photographs, his attorney has said. `` An analogy has to be drawn to Dr. <PERSON> Jekyll </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>,'' said the judge. He imposed the sentence after Franc's sister, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Waiters </PERSON>, a social worker from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, made an impassioned plea for her brother, describing him as a brilliant, bilingual teacher who inspired his students. `` I ask, I beg of you, Judge <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, do not let this mind go to waste in prison,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Waiters </PERSON> said in a trembling voice. `` He has so much to offer,'' she said. `` To shut him away and snuff out his creativity and productivity would be a terrible waste to society.'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said he hoped Franc would use the time in prison to help uneducated inmates improve themselves. `` I hope you do something beneficial with the rest of your life,'' he said. `` I think it's a shame it had to come to this. But these are your acts, no one else's acts.'' Franc, a native of DePere, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, was arrested after a chain saw he had rented was returned with bits of flesh and blood in it. `` Even if the only thing you did was watch someone else kill <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>, what type of person could go and rent a chain saw knowing it would be used to cut up a body?'' the judge asked Franc. `` There's no question that's exactly what you did.'' Deputy Public Defender <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiserman </PERSON> lost a bid for a new trial and reduction of the first-degree murder conviction. The judge said he felt the jury's verdict was proper even if Franc had only aided and abetted in the murder. He conceded that what actually happened was never clear and he could not conclude positively that Franc pulled the trigger to kill <PERSON> Nute </PERSON>. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said Franc `` ought to feel lucky that he does n't go to the gas chamber'' because special circumstances were not involved in the case. He said the pleas for leniency based on Franc's status as a college professor `` smacks to me of class distinction.'' <PERSON> Kaiserman </PERSON> said Franc will appeal his conviction.

<HEAD>Singapore Proposes Elected President, Keeping Parliamentary System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An official government report proposed Friday that <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> have an elected president who would act as custodian and not as chief executive, and that the parliamentary system be kept intact. The first deputy prime minister, <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chok </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, said in presenting the suggested government reforms to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>: `` The president will not be an executive president. He will only have a custodial role in two areas _ safeguarding our financial reserves and the integrity of our public service.'' <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> said the president should not have power to initiate policies or make executive decisions. The president currently has no special powers but is ceremonial head of the state. He must assent to any bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before it becomes law. The recommendations, drawn up by senior ministers, said the parliamentary system of government should not be altered. The prime minister and his Cabinet should govern the nation. On critical issues, they would still make the decisions but would have to seek the president's concurrence. If the president did not go along, the government could take the issue to the people. Parliament now elects the president for a four-year term. Under the changes, the people would directly elect the president for a six-year term. <PERSON> Sinnathamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajaratnam </PERSON>, senior minister in the office of longtime Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, indicated on July 22 that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> could be chosen president. `` As far as I know, they -LRB- ministers -RRB- have decided <PERSON> Goh </PERSON> should become the next prime minister the moment Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> steps down,'' <PERSON> Rajaratnam </PERSON> was quoted as telling reporters. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> will be 65 years old in September.

She also was told not to discuss the matter because it might hinder his rescue. But years later she learned from the Central Intelligence Agency that her husband was on a top secret mission over <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. That news angered her. `` I feel like I was lied to lots of time,'' she said. `` I feel like they withheld information.'' <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who had gone to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in search of her husband in 1973, cried throughout the service.

<HEAD>Deadline Extended For Completing Deal With Bass Group</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal thrift institution regulators said Friday they have extended the deadline for completing a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> to take over one of the nation's largest savings and loan associations. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it expected to wrap up negotiations with the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, Texas-based Bass group for acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, by Sept. 1. The bank board had announced on April 21 that it had granted exclusive negotiating rights to Bass until July 5, but later extended that to Aug. 1. According to the agency's statement, `` then as now ... the extension was granted because of the substantial progress made in the negotiations to that date.'' The ailing <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the second largest thrift holding company in the nation, has been a candidate for a government rescue for nearly a year When the deal is finally completed, it is likely to set a record as the largest rescue of a savings institution. According to a source familiar with the negotiations, the cost to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits in S & amp; Ls up to $ 100,000, would be roughly $ 1.3 billion to $ 2 billion. But, the source said, little or none of the assistance would be in cash. Most of it would come in the form of promissory notes from <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> or in guarantees against the risk of certain kinds of future losses. One of the factors apparently snagging the deal is the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s concern that the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> assistance would be subject to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 11 percent corporate income tax. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislature has scheduled a hearing Aug. 8 on a bill that would make it clear the tax does not apply. `` These have been complex negotiations, and the staff has worked out most of the economic terms,'' said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the bank board. `` However, there are other details to work out and documents to complete, and we as a board need time to carefully review the final recommendation from our staff.''

 Actress <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, who lost her right breast to cancer four years ago, said Friday the illness has returned but she will fight it with radiation therapy and willpower. <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, 52, said she learned this week she has a localized malignancy in her lymph nodes, but it is not spreading. She will undergo five weeks of radiation treatment. `` I was absolutely terrified again'' and her husband, tough guy actor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>, was `` shocked and fearful'' when told the diagnosis, she said during a news conference. The cancer was discovered when <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> sought treatment for what she thought was a strained shoulder. Instead, it turned out to be swollen lymph glands pressing on nerves above her right collar bone, she said. <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said she will also use a technique called visualization to battle the illness. `` I visualize my cancer as fish eggs, and three times a day I will visualize my piranha fish destroying, literally gnashing their teeth and destroying my cancer,'' she said. `` That's a very good technique because it stops you feeling like a victim.'' Miss <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> wrote a best-selling book called `` Life Wish'' about her 1984 bout with cancer and announced her new book, `` Life Lines,'' will appear in March. She declined to reveal the contents, calling it `` somewhat explosive.'' She also is scheduled to be host of a syndicated television talk show this winter, she said.

 The military deployed thousands of troops to guard against violence in a march Friday that marked the 1975 killing by security forces of 14 student demonstrators. About 600 students walked peacefully from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> campus to the downtown site where the 14 were killed on July 30, 1975. The marchers, many of them masked and carrying wooden staves or iron bars, placed banners and a wreath of evergreen branches and yellow roses at the site and sang a revolutionary song before returning to campus. Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>, the defense minister, told a news conference military intelligence had expected about 70 armed guerrillas among the marchers. He said leftist rebels battling the U.S.-backed government are infiltrating labor, student and peasant unions. At a separate news conference, a new alliance of peasants, students and leftist workers called the Bread, Land, Work and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> accused the armed forces of killing one of its leaders, <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON>. The government had called the alliance a guerrilla front. <PERSON> Orellana </PERSON> died Thursday after he was hit by a car in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, also leaders of the group, said the car had followed him for days and that he was run over intentionally. Armed forces officials were not available for comment on the allegation. After a July 21 rally by students and workers that turned violent, authorities were apprehensive about Friday's march. Police broke up the July 21 march with tear gas and gunfire. At least nine vehicles were burned in that demonstration. Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, head of the armed forces press office, said thousands of troops were mobilized Friday, including all <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> units in the capital. He said the 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> and air force paratroopers were put on alert. Police with assault rifles were posted throughout the capital near dawn. Loaded troop trucks patrolled downtown and two helicopters hovered over the marchers. `` We do n't cry for the martyrs of July 30th, we imitate them with combative struggle,'' the marchers chanted. `` Yankee invader, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> will be your tomb.'' The only incident occurred when soldiers tried to prevent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, doing work for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION>, from photographing a water cannon. They tried to handcuff him, then threw him to the ground before other journalists came to his aid and identified him. The soldiers then let <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> go.

 Convicted cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> told reporters Friday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is responsible for the cocaine problem and that he allowed himself to be captured because he opposes drug trafficking. Eight Bolivian journalists were allowed to meet with <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. He was arrested 10 days ago at his ranch 350 miles east of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. `` I hold the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration totally responsible for the great advance of this -LRB- drug -RRB- affliction against humanity because it had the obligation to delineate an efficient policy to confront the problem,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> told the reporters. They quoted him as saying, `` Without taking credit away from the police, I facilitated my capture precisely because I could not continue to carry the guilt of traffickers on my shoulders. That is why I decided to come and face the situation that awaited me and clear up my situation.'' He added: `` I am not the king of cocaine, but rather the king of the fight against cocaine. I have always fought to keep the price of cocaine high to save my people and humanity from the brutal effects of trafficking.'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, 57, was greeted with shouts of `` Long live the king!'' by inmates when he arrived at the La Paz prison Tuesday from another jail. He is serving a 15-year prison sentence imposed this year after he was convicted, in absentia, of dealing with illegal drugs. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1980. He was accused of conspiring to ship 854 pounds of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininistration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> dealt in tons of cocaine. `` He could be considered one of the pioneers involved in manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>. The prisoner also told the reporters that the cocaine trade has a strong influence in the world of politics, but he did not give any names of politicians who might have connections with drug traffickers. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, an impoverished country with a population of 6.7 million, produces at least a third of the cocaine that reaches <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European markets, according to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. It is estimated that about 350,000 Bolivians depend for their livelihood on cultivating coca leaves, processing them to be turned into cocaine or trafficking.

<HEAD>States Along Mississippi Disagree Over Duck Hunting Limits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Representatives from 14 states along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> disagreed Friday on how to restrict hunting to ease pressure on a duck population crippled by years of habitat destruction. Droughts this year and last added to the problem, which wildlife services and hunting organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have battled for years, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, chief of the game division of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flyway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents three Canadian provinces and a corridor of states stretching to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, is meeting to decide on season and bag limit recommendations it will present on Aug. 3 to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Less than a decade ago many states had seasons of 50 days or more. Last year, seasons averaged about 40 days in the flyway. The so-called upper flyway committee of the northern states Friday decided to go along with federal suggestions for a 30-day season, eding Jan. 1, and a four-duck bag limit. The lower flyway committee of the South went along with the 30-day season but wanted to continue the point system on the number of ducks taken _ each duck worth so many points with the point limit at 100 a day. For example, a Mallard would be worth 35 points. The real sticking point is the season's end. `` There is no way I can go for a January 1st date,'' said <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, chairman of the lower flyway committee. `` In north <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> if you do n't get the right weather you have no duck hunting until Christmas. You're talking about a week's season. His panel agreed, proposing an ending date of Jan. 15. Both committees were to report Saturday to the full council for a compromise. Federal wildlife experts say the flight population of ducks is expected to be 66 million this year, the lowest since the record of 1985 when 62 million were estimated to have moved through the flyway. Drought conditions have been a problem in the nesting grounds of the Canadian prairies for much of the decade, according to a federal report handed out at the council session. `` Moreover, agriculture activities continue to remove nesting and brood breeding habitat from the landscape,'' said the report. `` The outlook for a rapid return to better breeding conditions and much improved duck population is not good.'' Upper flyway panel states are <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. The southern states in the council are <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>.

 A convoy of 44 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activists delivered several tons of food, medicine and clothing to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government Friday and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> praised them at a public ceremony. `` These people are representatives of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who do n't want war, they want peace,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said to about 200 people who gathered in <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>. Wounded Nicaraguan soldiers watched the ceremony and children mobilized by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chanted: `` Let's go to war, carry the bullets!'' The Veterans Peace Convoy, sponsored by a Washington-based coalition of six activist groups, journeyed across <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for two weeks after a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Customs officials said the group, which includes many veterans, would violate a 1985 economic embargo if they donated their vehicles, as they plan to do. Humanitarian aid is allowed under the embargo. `` While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sends arms to the -LRB- rebel -RRB- Contras to murder our children, he tried also to obstruct this caravan,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` He said they carried goods that threatened the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had a child bring him a box of the goods and took out a baby bottle. `` Look at the weapons they brought,'' he said, holding it up. `` This is what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not want to arrive.'' He screwed the top on the bottle. `` The weapon is ready to fire,'' he announced. `` All it needs is milk.'' Convoy member <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> spoke out against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding for the rebels, known as Contras, who have been trying to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government for nearly seven years. `` This money that is sent to cause death here is being taken away from our children,'' he said. `` Our taxes should n't be used to kill Nicaraguans. It's unjust, immoral.'' The activists were given military T-shirts and Sandinista army hats. The ceremony ended with the Sandinista anthem, which proclaims: `` We fight against the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, enemies of humanity.'' A convoy spokesman said the supplies would go to three Sandinista organizations representing children, workers and women. He also said 18 of the 20 vehicles would be left in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with party organizations, including labor unions. The operations of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the government are closely intertwined in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. When the veterans crossed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border, they were told they faced fines of up to $ 50,000 each and 10 years in prison if they did not bring the vehicles back within 30 days. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday that no decision had been made on whether to file charges against convoy members. He said the case was under active review by the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. In June, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials stopped the original convoy of 38 vehicles from crossing into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. About 100 convoy participants drove to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to demonstrate against the decision, circling around the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and in front of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for three days. Eight members of the group were arrested July 9 when they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> bridge crossing at <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The convoy finally crossed the border July 14. The Sandinista newspaper <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said thousands of people greeted the convoy when it crossed the Honduran border Wednesday into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Two environmental protesters came down from their treetop perches into the waiting arms of sheriff's deputies Friday after professional climbers scaled a tree and cut loose one man's food and water. The tree-sitters had gone out on a limb in an attempt to stop construction of a logging road and to prevent the taking of timber in the remote section of the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The forest is in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s coastal mountains. `` It's inevitable,'' a protester who identified himself as <PERSON> Bald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said after he rappelled down a rope from his perch 80 feet up a charred Douglas fir. `` Obviously, they're not going to let us stop a $ 1 million road.'' He and the deputies traded good-natured jibes during the 90 minutes between their arrival and the arrests. A woman also came down from her plywood perch lashed to a trunk after watching two tree climbers who perform at timber carnivals scale the other protester's tree and cut loose the small platform holding his food and water. Authorities identified the tree-sitters as <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinnott </PERSON>, 28, of nearby Cave Junction, and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Elke </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Novato </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Deputies arrested a third person on a ridge overlooking the site He was identified as <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haun </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. All three were charged with trespassing. The environmental group Earth First! is fighting <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plans to extend a gravel road nearly a mile to allow salvage logging. The area was burned last summer in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s biggest forest fire in 50 years, a 96,500-acre blaze The timber industry contends the dead trees will otherwise go to waste. Opponents argue that building roads and logging will promote erosion that will damage salmon and steelhead spawning beds in tributaries of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> failed in a bid to get a court order stopping the road and the logging. <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> County Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnado </PERSON> sent deputies Friday to remove the protesters. The trees were cut down immediately after their arrest. He said one tree-sitting protester escaped before dawn today while deputies camped below. The three tree-sitters had taken the places of three who had spent eight days in the trees before one of them was surprised and arrested Wednesday evening while taking a break on the ground. The sheriff said deputies would be on 24-hour guard to keep other protesters out of the trees.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency Saturday blamed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for blocking progress at this week's Cambodian peace talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said little was accomplished at the meeting, which ended Thursday. It characterized <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s stance at the talks as `` indeed disappointing.'' The agency also said the Hanoi-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> `` had neither new ideas nor sincerity for the solution.'' The talks brought together for the first time <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s leaders and rebels from a three-party coalition, but they reached no agreements on a solution to the nine-year conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The sides agreed to set up a working group for further discussions. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said the talks led to some general progress, but the strongest guerrilla faction, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, called that assertion `` a shameless lie.'' Cambodian Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> blamed lack of progress on the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In its commentary, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> tried to take the initiative by holding news conferences and putting forth a seven-point peace proposal. However, the news agency charged that `` their basic stand on three key issues did not change at all.'' The commentary said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> refused to set a definite timetable for rapid withdrawal of its troops, continued to insist on disarming the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and ousting it from the resistance coalition, and refused to dissolve the current <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to withdraw its estimated 120,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990, but it also demands assurances the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will not return to power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled from 1975-78, and are accused of killing more than a million people in a reign of terror while trying to turn <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> into a primitive agrarian society. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the main supplier of arms and funds to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. It also strongly supports the three-party resistance coalition.

 An oceanographer's study released Friday says the medical-type waste washing ashore on northeastern beaches was probably dumped near the mouth of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in mid-June. The waste, including syringes, vials of blood and what appeared to be hospital or clinic equipment, began appearing on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in early July and in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> later in the month It resulted in periodic beach closings. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, two large beaches reopened to swimmers Friday after authorities reported that only a small number of syringes and other debris had washed ashore. But about 30 beaches along a 10-mile stretch from <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> to Rye on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> were closed to swimmers because of syringes washing up, and a popular <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach was closed because of sewage. Heavy rain in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area this week prompted officials to close beaches and ban shellfishing in some areas. The rain poured more than 400 million gallons of dirty storm water into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and neighboring streams. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> oceanographer <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> said the medical-type waste sightings in northeastern states are consistent with a release in the V-shaped section of ocean leading to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on June 11-16. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said he was sending copies of the report to Govs. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and urging them to crack down on waste dumping. `` It seems clear from this excellent scientific detective work that our beaches are being fouled by wastes from other states,'' <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> said in a statement accompanying the report. <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> said his study was based on meteorological data from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said he used the wind and current data to both track the waste backward from where it was found and forward from potential sources. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> was reopened because the amount of medical waste found, including nine syringes, was not considered significant. Although authorities refer to the problem as medical waste, they say many of the syringes could have come from individual diabetics or drug users. The waste has not been linked to any hospital or clinic. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a popular <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> bathing spot, was closed Friday after sewage debris was seen floating in the water. The beach, along a four mile stretch of western <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, will remain closed until health inspectors can ensure that the water quality is safe, according to <ORGANIZATION> Nassau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Domash </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Anglicans Seek Compromise on Issue of Woman Bishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A compromise shaped up from private discussions at the Lambeth Conference Friday on the issue of consecrating the first women bishop in the Anglican church. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, head of the Anglican communion, has said that although all Anglican churches probably would accept women priests, a woman bishop could split the communion. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> church and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> church are considering consecrating women bishops. The 525 bishops representing 70 million Anglicans in 164 countries will debate the issue Monday at the Lambeth Conference. A compromise resolution drafted Friday by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Tuam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, urges the conference to respect differences of opinion. It says the conference recognizes `` the serious hurt which would result from the questioning of the validity of the episcopal acts of a woman bishop, and likewise the hurt experienced by those whose conscience would be offended by the ordination of a woman to the episcopate. `` The church needs to exercise sensitivity, patience and pastoral care toward all concerned. `` While addressing the issue we have tried to stress the deep hurt that will be involved both ways among those who are offended by it and by those who do not feel it goes far enough.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, introduced a resolution saying women should not be consecrated as bishops `` for the avoidance of further impairment of communion both within and between the churches.'' Monday's debate will come at the start of the last week of the three-week conference. This is the first Lambeth Conference to be held in 10 years. Each of the 27 Anglican churches worldwide is self-governing but they look to the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for guidance and <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is the world Anglican leader. The last <ORGANIZATION> Lambeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 evaded the issue of women priests by saying all the member churches should respect each other's decisions. The question of a woman bishop did not arise at that time. According to conference statistics, some 1,200 women have been admitted to the priesthood by a minority of the Anglican churches, most of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Opponents say the concept of woman priests does not exist in Bible teaching. They also say that bishops are considered the successors of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s Apostles, who were men, and if a woman bishop is consecrated some churches might leave the communion on grounds she could not be in communion with the other bishops.

 A pipe bomb exploded early Friday in a mailbox at <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, just hours after a similar bomb was discovered in the county courthouse at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, about 200 miles to the north, authorities said. No one was injured in the Salem explosion, and damage was minor, police said. The bomb found in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse was removed safely and detonated by police explosives experts. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, police said eight sticks of dynamite were found Thursday in a city park, but were not wired to explode, police said. `` I have no idea if there is a connection, or if it is a copycat thing,'' said <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>. Since early July, a variety of explosive devices have been planted in four <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> communities. No arrests have been made, and investigators have established no connection among the incidents. The bomb that detonated about 12:45 a.m. at <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> was the second to explode in the state in a week. An exploding bomb destroyed a door at a Loogootee school the night of July 22, causing about $ 500 damage but injuring no one. In the first <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> incident on July 5, 13 dynamite time bombs were discovered scattered around the city, prompting the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> to send an investigative team from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, that he does not believe the two <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> incidents are related. Investigators also discount the possibility of a link with the explosion at <LOCATION> Loogootee </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>. In South Bend, the investigation is being handled by city and county authorities. On Wednesday a section of pipe wired to a battery and timing device, but containing no explosives, was found on a city street. `` We are not discounting the theory that the incidents are connected,'' said sheriff's Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. The courthouse bomb was found around 8 p.m. by a cleaning worker in a basement restroom, said Sheriff <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>. Police evacuated six employees who had remained after office hours and routed traffic away from the courthouse. The bomb was removed by a remote-operated pulley and exploded at a gravel pit outside the city, police said. The dynamite used in the original <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> bombs was traced to a theft of dynamite last month from a crushed stone quarry in English, about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, investigators say. Investigators said the bombs were improperly wired. Three of the bombs ignited, but did not explode, and produced only smoke and small fires. The <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> each have offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

 The movie `` Cry Freedom'' opened in more than 30 South African theaters Friday with the censor's approval, but police said it threatened public safety and seized the copies seven hours later. They cited two bombs, anonymous phone threats and violent scenes in the movie as evidence that it was dangerous. Movie-goers at the Northcliff Theater in a rich white <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb arrived to find posters being taken down and police ready to confiscate the film. `` Cry Freedom'' was replaced by `` I Was A Teen-Age Vampire.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>, who directed the movie, said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>: `` I never believed they would show it. ... The overall reason for making the film was to tell people the truth about apartheid, and about how it struck both black and white South Africans.'' <PERSON> Nomphelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndabula </PERSON>, 19, emerged from a theater in tears. `` I was nearly heartbroken,'' she said. `` The people, especially whites, must see the film. They will see that the black man must have rights. They will see that blacks are people.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said of the police action: `` We at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> condemn the actions of the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. However, we applaud the courage of <ORGANIZATION> UIP </ORGANIZATION>, the film's overseas distributor, and local theater owners throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> who agreed to play the film despite the controversy and pressure.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumpel </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying, `` We abhor any censorship, wherever found in the world, and are appalled by the actions of the South African government.'' <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON> is a guild member. The <ORGANIZATION> Publication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ruled Friday morning, for the second time, that the film could be shown. It said the movie, which depicts the death in detention in 1977 of young black consciousness leader <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, was biased against police but did not endanger race relations or state security. Gen. <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, the police commissioner, declared in a statement Friday evening that the film `` endangers the safety of the public, the maintenance of public order, and will delay the termination of the state of emergency'' imposed on June 12, 1986. Minister of Information <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said the government decided to override the board because the censors could not judge `` the situation on the streets.'' `` The security forces are portrayed in such a negative light that their public image would be seriously undermined,'' he said. `` Whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth, as opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to exploitation and repression.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said those portrayals were not accurate. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system establishes a society in which the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate residential districtes, schools, health services and recreation areas. The movie, directed by <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON> in neighboring <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, is based on two books by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a white newspaper editor who befriended <PERSON> Biko </PERSON> and fled the country after <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> is banned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and it is illegal to quote him, as actor <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> does in portraying him, but <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> did not mention that point in ordering the copies confiscated under emergency regulations. Explosions, but no injuries, were reported at two theaters showing `` Cry Freedom.'' The blast at the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> theater in downtown <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> occurred soon after police evacuated a multiracial crowd of 300 and the other was at Kings Cinema in <LOCATION> Alexandra </LOCATION>, a black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Theaters in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the largest black township near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, reported receiving anonymous bomb threats. The censorship board approved the film without restrictions in November. It was to open in April but distributors withdrew it, asking for assurances no one would be prosecuted for showing the film. The government made no promises. <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, home affairs minister, ordered the board this week to review its decision. The censors held a hearing Thursday and announced Friday morning the movie could be shown with an age restriction of 19. Showings began half an hour later. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> told a news conference the movie was intended as an anti-South <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> propaganda instrument, and `` We do n't need that sort of internal disturbance and excitement from people like <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>.'' Police reported threats and violence at one theater but did not name it. There were no reports of such disturbances from journalists who joined audiences around the country. `` I do n't think people will go out and riot because it's about events we all know about,'' said a black youth at the Kine Theater in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He would not give his name. The audience of 200, most of them black teen-agers, jumped forward in their seats and hissed during the scene at the end in which white policemen open fire on marching <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> schoolchildren in 1976. Sobs also could be heard. People sat with hands in front of their mouths. The hissing grew when the camera showed patches of blood on the children's crisp, white school shirts. Several blacks sang softly along with the soundtrack of `` God Bless <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' which many blacks consider to be their national anthem. It ends with the shout, `` Amandla!'' the Zulu word for power. Many viewers joined the shout, then the audience filed out without waiting for the credits.

<HEAD>Government Closes Visa Loophole For Tennis Stars, Golfers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Canadian government closed a loophole Friday that allowed South African tennis stars, golfers and other athletes to compete in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> despite a <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> ban on sporting links with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in the future, individuals traveling on South African passports and seeking entry into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to participate in a sports event will be denied visas. The change means that South African tennis players <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christo </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Rensburg </PERSON>, scheduled to compete in next week's Canadian Open tennis tournament in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, will be denied visas The minister told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week that he intended to close the loophole in a 1977 agreement that encourages <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> countries to combat apartheid by discouraging contact or competition with athletes from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> reacted to that announcement by saying sports in his country had been fully integrated for years. `` Isolating individual South African sportsmen and women can make no positive contribution towards change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. Opposition members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> pointed out that the agreement was effective against sports teams from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but individuals were entering the country on business visas. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said his action `` is fully in keeping with the major role the Canadian government has played in the international struggle against apartheid.'' Next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> committee of foreign ministers on <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> will meet in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to review the fight against apartheid, although no new sanctions are expected. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> is chairman of the eight-member committee.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Light Source At Bottom Of Pacific</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 There is light at the bottom of the deep dark seas, scientists say they have discovered off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. A group of scientists headed by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> oceanographers said they photographed the ocean-bottom light at hydrothermal vents 180 miles off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. The vents, openings along the ridges where the plates of the Earth's surface meet, spew out 650-degree water that has picked up minerals in the seabed. The light confirms a hypothesis that <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON>, 34, a graduate student in oceanography in a joint Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> program, has been working on for two years. The discovery also ends the long-held scientific belief that there is no light at the ocean bottoms, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, 46, <ORGANIZATION> UW </ORGANIZATION> professor of oceanography and lead scientist for the dive. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON>, after whom the light has been named the `` Van Dover Glow,'' began her research in the summer of 1986 on live shrimp that crowded together around <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> hot springs feeding on bacteria. The creatures lack normal shrimp eyes. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> said she noticed large organs beneath their shells that had no lenses, but otherwise looked like eyes. Further study proved the organs were light-sensitive, although they could not form images. `` If hot springs glow, then the shrimp would be able to use the organs to lead them to the glow, and hence, to food,'' Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> hypothesized. Tuesday, during the research submersible <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON>'s final 2,200-meter dive, which is nearly 1.4 miles below sea level, the scientists said they finally proved the hypothesis. Submarine pilot <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> held the vessel steady enough against strong currents for a camera to take 20-second exposures of the hot springs. When processed, the images showed light coming from two different hot springs, the scientists said. The university announced the findings before the scientists could publish them in any journal where they would be subject to peer review. Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> said scientists do not yet know what produces the light, but it could be because the minerals in the water heat up so much they glow or it could be due to a chemical reaction. The light could offer some new possibilities to theories of evolution of living creatures, Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> said. `` The thought that there could be photosynthesis -LRB- using light to produce food -RRB- down there is an entirely new idea,'' she said. `` There has been a lot of thought on the origin of life and how deep-sea life may have played in it.'' The <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> is scheduled to make another dive in four weeks, and <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said either he or Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> will be aboard. The two are considering experiments for that trip including identifying the color of the light, its wavelength and measuring how far it penetrates through the water, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> refused Friday to give her fingerprints to police, who said they have new evidence in the investigation of how she handled donations for her dying son's liver transplants <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutors have been looking into Mrs. DeSillers' handling of more than $ 689,000 donated for her 7-year-old son <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, who died in April 1987 awaiting his fourth liver transplant <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerwens </PERSON> said new developments from the investigation prompted his department to issue a search warrant for the finger and palm prints of Mrs. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> and several others.

Mrs. DeSillers' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, filed a motion in <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Friday, saying issuance of a search warrant for the woman's fingerprints is `` an invasion of her body.''

The 22 countries met at <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s invitation to create a `` zone of peace and cooperation'' in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The concept involves keeping the region free of military bases and nuclear arms in accordance with a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution. The countries voted to `` condemn the abhorrent policy of the racist regime of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the continued illegal occupation and colonial domination of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, South African acts of aggression against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and other neighboring states.'' By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

 A lawyer who won acquittal two weeks ago for a suspected guerrilla leader was found shot to death on an oceanside highway near <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. It said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 45, was killed Thursday morning and his body was recovered hours later, with no identification. Police said he was beaten and was shot seven times. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a member of a laywers' group accused by the government of having ties to the leftist Shining Path guerrillas, successfully defended <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morote </PERSON> against terrorism charges and won his acquittal. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Crespo </PERSON>, blamed a `` repressive instrument of the government'' for the killing. A group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, after an official slain by the Maoist-oriented Shining Path last year, called <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspapers and claimed responsibility for the death, reporters said.

 Hungarian leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, ending a 30-hour visit to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, said Friday that reforms in his country will not include loosening <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, premier and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Western capital is necessary to help finance economic progress in his country but <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is not prepared for a political system with more than one party. `` This is not timely today in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' he told a news conference. `` I've seen countries in the world having a multiparty system and still having no democracy.'' Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved economic and political reforms that include the creation of a `` socialist market economy'' and legalizing the framework for a pluralist party system. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the reforms will not undermine the goals of communism. `` We want a socialist system that works better,'' he said. `` If a theory is carried out in a mistaken way, this does n't necessarily mean the system is not working.'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who has acknowledged the failure of austerity measures he pursued after becoming premier in June 1987, said joint business ventures between Hungarian industries and foreign corporations are a key to overcoming the nation's economic stagnation. `` But I would n't like the Hungarian government to engage in doing business, that's up to businessmen,'' he said. After a 55-minute meeting with Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> leader `` agreed 100 percent with all the ideas I put forward.'' There was no comment from <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also met hydroelectric, atomic energy and telecommunications company executives to discuss possible joint ventures. He refused to meet with Hungarian-Canadian human rights activists angry at <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s resettlement plans that include the elimination of about 7,000 villages populated mainly by ethnic Hungarians. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has sent a protest letter to the Romanian government and added: `` As for the refugees -LRB- coming from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> -RRB-, we accept all those who ask for the right to stay with us in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> on Friday found the Honduran government guilty in the 1981 disappearance of a student in police custody and ordered it to pay damages to the man's family. A government spokesman said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> will comply with the order, the first verdict handed down by the court. The decision in the case of <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Manfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, 35, a university student leader, came after an eight-month trial. The court is an agency of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the capital of neighboring <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Its seven international jurists are handling other cases of Central American citizens who disappeared while in custody or suffered other human rights abuses. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' independent <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> claims 150 people have disappeared in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> during the past eight years, and another 800 have been slain for political motives. <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>, a leftist, was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> when police arrested him Sept. 8, 1981, during the rightist military government of Gen. <PERSON> Policapo </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> He has not been heard from since. Student and labor activists protested his disappearance at the time and several armed groups briefly invaded radio stations, newspapers, news agencies and other media to press demands for an investigation. <PERSON> Lisando </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>, a spokesman for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON>, told reporters: `` <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>'s family will be -LRB- compensated -RRB- by the state because <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> faithfully complies with obligations under international agreements.'' <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON> refused to say how much the compensation will be. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Custodio </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he was satisfied with the court's decision and hoped it will mark a new stage in respect for human rights in the region. `` Let us hope this case constitutes a starting point for wider investigations on abuses of human life in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> had denied the charges against it, but two key witnesses in the case were shot to death in the Central American nation in January in what human rights advocates claim was an effort by death squads to silence their critics.

 Folk singer <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> were sentenced to 15 days in jail Friday on disorderly conduct charges stemming from a racially charged demonstration over an alleged rape. <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> Police Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON> also found 10 others guilty of disorderly conduct for disrupting traffic during an April 4 demonstration near the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. The protesters claim racism in the investigation of a claim by <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, a black Wappingers Falls teen-ager, that she was abducted and raped by six white men last November. Two defendants were acquitted after the three-day, non-jury trial. One of those acquitted, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, had tears running down his face as he said he wanted to join the others as they were taken directly to jail. As he was led out of court, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a minister who also is the subject of state and federal investigations into his financial dealings, raised his fist and shouted, `` Tell <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to straighten this out!'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and two other <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> advisers, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> lawyers <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, have accused <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of racism because he appointed the state attorney general, rather than a prosecutor of their choosing, to look into the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> case. A handful of demonstrators in court briefly chanted `` No justice, no peace'' following the sentencing. The defendants, who all got 15 days in jail, were led away to begin serving their sentences immediately at the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, who represented all the defendants except <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, called the decision a `` political hit.'' `` It's clear the Constitution does not apply to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON> and any other people who support the elimination of racism and discrimination and particularly those who support <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said after the sentencing he was searching for a judge that he could ask to grant bail Friday evening pending appeal of the demonstrators' convictions. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> had argued that the defendants were exercising their constitutional right to free speech in the demonstration. Assistant <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> focused his case on whether the demonstrators ignored repeated warnings by police to disperse when they tried to block traffic. He said the demonstrators could have gotten off with fines if they had not insisted on a trial. State Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> has said his inquiry will probably end without the arrest of any suspects because Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family will not cooperate, on the advice of <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>.

 Higher humidity Friday gave firefighters the upper hand against a 3,000-acre forest fire that had destroyed 15 homes on the western edge of the city, but it remained the top-priority fire in the nation. `` We're very confident today,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON>, fire incident commander. He said the fire was 90 percent contained by afternoon. Only a wisp of smoke was visible during the afternoon, drifting with light wind. `` If the weather holds we're pretty confident that no other structures will be lost,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> said much of Friday was spent strengthening fire containment lines. Firefighters said they hoped to contain the arson blaze by early Saturday and control it by Sunday. That was the first time since the fire started Tuesday that firefighters had given an estimate of when they might get a handle on the blaze in the forested <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` It's looking a lot more positive than it has,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. Hundreds of people had evacuated their homes from several subdivisions in and around the forest, and all but 125 people were allowed to return home by Friday evening. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ickler </PERSON>, who left his home on Wednesday, said he did n't know what to expect when he returned Friday. The fire burned to within a few feet of his house, but it was not damaged. `` You feel like doing a cartwheel to see your home standing,'' he said. `` The emotions really run.'' Fire crews in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where about 93,000 acres of forest has burned, took the calculated risk Friday of setting their own fires in dead timber and brush to rob major fires of fuel paths to building complexes. Park officials said the south entrance to the park will reopen Sunday because the danger of fire reaching buildings around the Old Faithful geyser had been significantly reduced. Fires fed by drought-dried fields and forests also blackened regions of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. But all of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s fires had been tamed by Friday, officials said. Humidity of 40 percent to 50 percent was expected to slow the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> fire, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. `` Last night firefighters were able to work on that line that they've been trying to complete in the southeast along Highway 44,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said Friday. Crews working by hand finished burning all the fuel between the edge of the fire and the fire line. Flames jumped the highway at one point but only about 20 acres burned on the other side before the fire was extinguished, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxler </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The blaze licking into housing developments in hills along the western edge of this city of 50,000 people was the top priority fire in the nation, <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> said. `` That basically means that when resources are requested for this fire we will receive first priority,'' he said. Members of volunteer fire departments from around the state saved 100 houses Thursday with an estimated value of $ 3.7 million, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. Those departments had brought 65 fire trucks to the area to pump water onto threatened houses. A local businessman and his father have started a fund for the firefighters, saying they should be rewarded for their work. `` Firefighters are really risking their lives to protect structures as well as they can,'' <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> said. `` One house had the aluminum window sills melted out of it, and firemen were still able to save the house.'' In addition, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopters carried hundreds of loads of water to dump on buildings in the path of the fire. Considering that the fire spread over 600 more acres of housing areas Thursday, firefighters did well to lose only eight houses that day, said <PERSON> Waxler </PERSON>. The fire also had destroyed 40 outbuildings and more than 40 vehicles. Elsewhere, 10 families driven from their cabins in two developments in a mountainous area northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, because of the 4,600-acre <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulch </PERSON> fire were allowed to return home Friday night. More crews joined firefighters on the lines Friday, raising the number of firefighters to more than 970. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> revised the number of acres burned from 95,000 down to about 93,000 after aerial infrared mapping in the 2.2 million acre park, which is the size of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> combined. On the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire, which forced the closure of the park's <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and threatened buildings in the complex, officials got part way through a planned 300-acre burnout designed to put a quarter-mile buffer around the village. Heli-torches _ flame throwers on helicopters _ were used to set burnouts on the northeast flank of the 8,800-acre North Fork fire, which threatened the large hotel and services complex surrounding the Old Faithful geyser. `` We're happy with the burnout so far,'' said fire spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` Once we get the northeast head of the fire dealt with, it can go north, away from Old Faithful.''

 The high heels, bunny tails and figure-shaping costumes that transformed cocktail-serving into a sexual fantasy will be just a memory Saturday, when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> closes. The <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in a Lansing hotel was filled to its 250-patron capacity on Friday night for one last party, and 60 people ended up standing outside. `` I want to grab a cottontail,'' said 42-year-old <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. `` This is the first and last time I'll be here, so it's worth a wait,'' said <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, who had never been to the Lansing club but had fond memories of visits to the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> more than a dozen years ago. `` The food was great, the atmosphere was great. It was a place to go to meet executive-type husband material,'' she said. Inside, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavorsky </PERSON>, a quiet man of `` around 60,'' sat alone at the end of the bar, watching the camera crews and shaking his head. <PERSON> Tavorsky </PERSON> said he'd been a three-times-a-week patron for the past four years and could n't remember a time when it was as crowded. `` A week ago there were n't 20 people hre,'' he said. `` This is something.'' Outside in a hallway, bunny <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> _ even on the last night they obeyed the rules about revealing their last names _ was taking a snapshot of the waiting crowd while bunny <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION> posed for with a beaming man who tipped her $ 10 and whispered his hotel room number. <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION> just rolled her eyes. `` We get a lot of this,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Rochelle </ORGANIZATION>, a bunny for two years, said the last week had been tough on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s last nine bunnies, though tips were good. `` There's few girls, so it's been difficult to take care of the quantity of people,'' she said. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> trappings _ oversized posters of magazine covers and other memorabilia _ were to be auctioned for charity. The custom-fit bunny costumes, however, will not be on the auction block, said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomcsin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Those go back to <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> opened the first <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1960 and the clubs had their heyday in the 1970s, when there were 22 around the world. The company-owned clubs were closed in 1986, and the three remaining franchise contracts _ with hotels in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Neb </ORGANIZATION>.; and <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION> _ were not renewed this year, <PERSON> Tomcsin </PERSON> said. Thriving clubs remain in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tomcsin </PERSON> said the company plans more overseas operations. <PERSON> Tomcsin </PERSON> said she has been surprised by the media attention the Lansing closing received. `` We just had a big deal with the last of the company-owned clubs,'' she said. `` That was different. We had been around for 26 years. We were very established. The Lansing club opened in'82 _ you ca n't really compare.'' <PERSON> Tomscin </PERSON> said the media attention shows the Playboy philosophy had an impact on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We were more than just a fad,'' she said. `` We had become an important part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture. Writer <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON>, who once took a job as a bunny to write an expose, offered a different perspective. `` I think that <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> clubs were based on sexual repression of men and economic, kind of, oppression of women and I'm glad to say both things are ending,'' <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> said in an interview with ABC News. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Lansing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> said the closing announcement boosted business at the club, which scrapped the key cards and let in the general public in 1987. `` Business has increased four or five times,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> general manager <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. `` I think a lot of people realize it's the end of a bit of Americana.'

 The newly merged Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday elected a former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> commando, <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, as its first leader. <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, 47, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since 1983, faced a tough fight to restore the flagging fortunes of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s centrist, third-ranking political movement. Its ratings have slumped in acrimony over the merger, which was made final last March. <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beith </PERSON>, by 41,401 votes to 16,202, in a 72 percent turnout by the party membership after a lackluster campaign. Both men formerly belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> said after his election that the new party had three years _ until to the next election _ to supplant the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as the only prospect of providing a viable alternative to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives. `` I do n't underestimate the scale of the task,'' <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON> said in a television interview. `` But if I did n't believe we could do that I would n't be doing this job.'' The Liberals precipitated the merger after their electoral alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed at the last election in June 1987 to break the power grip of the Conservatives and Labor.. Social Democratic leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a former foreign secretary, refused to merge and has maintained a breakaway faction as a separate party, thus splitting the already minority centrist vote <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, who did not run for the leadership of the new party, blamed the alliance's disappointing showing in 1987 partly on having two leaders. The alliance took 22.5 percent of the vote, down from one-fourth at the previous general election in 1983. The centrists' ratings in the latest poll, by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> last week, were down to 7 percent for the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 3 percent for <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s faction. <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Yeovil </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, served in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s elite, undercover <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and later as a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> captain in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, before turning diplomat.

 Two gunmen wearing hardhats, masks and sunglasses pistol-whipped a guard and stole more than $ 300,000 from an armored car outside a bank, authorities said.

While the new administration estimate released Thursday is higher, it is still below the more gloomy projections earlier this year by many private economists, who were forecasting a deficit of $ 160 billion or worse. Those economists have been busy revising their own figures, and some now say the administration's new deficit forecast for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 may actually be too pessimistic.

 A critical launch pad test-firing of the space shuttle Discovery's main engines was delayed three more days Friday and it seemed almost certain the first post-Challenger shuttle flight would slip into October. The postponement of the firing from Monday until Thursday, the third delay in a week, came while the launch team was pumping propellant into Discovery's huge external fuel tank, the first time a shuttle had been fueled since Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986. Once the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen started to flow, engineers' worst fears were realized. Pumps, lines and sensors not used in 2 -LCB- years began to fail.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nickelodeon </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION>'' service knows its audience is the TV generation, so it will expand its lineup this fall to include more old comedies and a new but old-style cartoon series from animator <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> Show'' comes to the cable channel's night-time lineup of nostalgia, which already includes such classics as `` Mr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>,'' `` My Three Sons,'' `` The <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> Show'' and `` Make Room for Daddy.'' Nickelodeon is also adding two more contemporary comedy showcases. Beginning Sept. 12, viewers can see `` The Best of ` Saturday Night Live'' and `` SCTV'' back-to-back nightly, 10-11 p.m. EDT. `` ` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION>' is targeting the new American family. Our demographics tell us that both kids and their parents are watching. We're not sure who is dragging whom to the set _ the mom who loves ` <PERSON> Donna </PERSON>' and remembers it or the kid who just discovered ` Mr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>,''' Nickelodeon Vice President <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> told a meeting of television critics. `` We've decided we've become a <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> with a beer and a fridge thrown in for good measure,'' she said. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, who also appeared at the presentation to TV critics, said his half-hour cartoon `` Tattertown'' would be an homage to the old-style animation of the 1920s and'30s. The series is set in a village inhabited by cartoon characters. `` We'll have characters sitting in bars or in parks wondering why did n't they make it; they could have been as big as <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON>, but they did n't have an organization behind them,'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said. The concept sounds something like the wildly successful feature-length animated film `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' which is set in ` <LOCATION> Toon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said he created the concept for `` Tattertown'' back in high school, but added, `` if it does sound like it -LRB- ` <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>' -RRB-, that's fine.'' For `` Tattertown,'' <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said he will create new characters, where `` Roger Rabbit'' featured cameos by already famous cartoon characters. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> did n't escape questions about his network cartoon show, `` Mighty Mouse,'' and the charge by conservative media critic Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> that Mighty Mouse snorted cocaine in one episode. <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> said the mouse was sniffing flower petals, but later cut those seconds from the episode to quiet the controversy. `` When an adult makes a statement enough times, the kids are going to believe it, and I did n't want it to become an issues at school _ did he or did n't he?'' said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, adding he has a 10-year-old son. He said if it had been an adult cartoon, he would have resisted any changes, but in this case, `` my first concern was with the kids.'' `` <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION>'' will also have its own satirical news show, `` Global Village,'' which boasts a similarly satirical promo, a takeoff on the currently popular up-close, cinema verite commercials. The `` Global Village'' motto is, `` If we do n't cover it, it does n't matter.'' As far day-time <PERSON> Nickelodeon </PERSON>, which features kids' programming, the cable channel plans to add the new show `` Kids Court,'' in which kids decide such issues as whether to turn in a friend for cheating on a test, and who should have to fix a broken portable stereo. There's also `` Eureka's Castle,'' a show aimed at pre-schoolers' problems, such as being afraid of the dark or having to make a telephone call Kids will also get to vote in a <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION> poll on who should be president after a series of reports on the campaign by a kid reporter. Nickelodeon announced it is developing a kids' news show, but it will probably be a few years before it gets on the air <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Networks </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION>, also announced some changes for its music video channel VH-1. That channel, aimed at older viewers, is going this fall to a half-hour format rather than radio-like continuous music. Each half hour, viewers will get an entertainment news update, a video, a comedy short, another video, then a `` time capsule'' look back at a moment in history before the half hour concludes with more videos.

 Madison Avenue's forecasters say the writers' strike is unlikely to have much effect on television network standings in the fall Executives of two major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising agencies predict that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will keep a tight grip on first place in the Nielsen ratings. <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s largest agency, said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS would be neck-and-neck for second place. `` It's unlikely the standings will change from our original forecasts, even given the fact there will be cut-and-paste schedules in the fall,'' she said by telephone from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The pattern of network viewing is pretty hard to shake.'' <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, executive vice president and director of national broadcast for <PERSON> McCann-Erickson </PERSON>, also sees tough competition for second place. `` <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will remain the No. 1 network,'' he said. `` If anything, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> may have a leg up because of the promotion time available in ` War and Remembrance' to promote its new schedule. I think <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> will postpone its new shows until after ` War and Remembrance' in November.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> plans to telecast the first 18 hours of <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Wouk </PERSON>'s `` War and Remembrance'' miniseries in seven parts over 11 days in mid-November. It advanced the showing because of a program shortage caused by the writers strike. Both agencies published reports on the fall season as originally planned by the networks. Although <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> was more optimistic about the end of the strike, both executives looked for a return to work that would enable the networks to get their new shows on by late November or early December. `` I ca n't make any predictions about individual shows until the strike's over,'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` All bets are off until then.'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> had forecast in the <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> report that despite vigorous competition from cable, videocassettes, <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> the networks would lose only a small share of their audience. He said the audience would drop to about 71 percent this year from 72 percent in 1987. `` It's impossible to make any forecast at this time,'' he said, `` but I would say ` War and Remembrance' and the Olympics and World Series on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will tend to increase viewing. But repeats of old shows and series that were never meant to be on the air, like <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s ` The Hardy Boys,'' would tend to reduce viewing. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that the clients of her agency had already made their network advertising purchases based on the original fall schedules. She said the delay in starting the fall schedule could alter the performances of individual programs forecast in her report. The <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compton </ORGANIZATION> report sees <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest'' and `` Dear John'' as the three hottest new shows of the fall. It also forecast a `` very good'' chance for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' and `` Almost Grown'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and `` Tattinger's. It offered little hope for such long shots as `` <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Knight Watch'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Dirty Dancing'' and `` Close to Home.'' <PERSON> McCann-Erickson </PERSON> predicted `` smash hits'' for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest'' and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>.'' It gave `` passing grades'' to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' `` Baby Boom'' and `` Tattinger's.'' `` Roseanne,'' from the same people who make `` The Cosby Show,'' stars comedienne <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> as a blue collar woman juggling her husband, kids, home and a job. `` Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of `` The Golden Girls,'' stars <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> as a widower with three grown children who has now become an eligible bachelor.

<TEXT>
 For many retired Americans, the temptations are growing stronger to venture back into the labor force. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 14 years, and new young workers are scarce because of the low birth rates that prevailed in this country in the 1960s and early 1970s. Students of population trends say the situation will almost certainly grow more acute over the next few years. Retail stores, restaurant chains, supermarkets and many other types of businesses are looking to the retired as one source of help for their labor-shortage problem. What's more, even in an era where reported inflation is relatively low, many retirees may find that they want or need some extra income. The match seems perfect. However, says a leading advisory firm on business and financial affairs, retirees are well advised to do some reckoning before they go out in quest of a new paycheck. `` Social Security beneficiaries who want to rejoin the work force should calculate carefully before making the move,'' says <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Babson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Report </ORGANIZATION>, published in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. As the firm points out, <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> recipients under age 70 who earn money from a job lose $ 1 in benefits for every $ 2 of wages they receive above specified limits. At the same time, they must pay income taxes and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> taxes on their earnings from the job. `` A working beneficiary could conceivably lose 65 percent or more of his or her added income,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Babson </PERSON> says. Of course, the decision to work or not to work in a person's later years may be influenced by emotional factors as well as financial ones When a leading graduate business school asked recently at what age the members of a reunion class would like to retire, a very large percentage of those who filled out the questionnaire checked `` never.'' Still, it is a sensible idea to figure out beforehand whether taking a job in your retirement years is going to make you enough take-home money to justify the effort. This year, Social Security recipients between ages 65 and 70 begin to lose benefits after their wage and salary earnings exceed $ 8,400. For those under 65, the cutoff point is $ 6,120 `` If a retiree goes back to work at a salary significantly above the limit, he should request that benefits be suspended,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Babson </PERSON>'s analysts advise. That goes especially for workers 65 to 70 years old, they add, since passing up current benefits will increase the Social Security payments they are eligible to receive later on. All this raises the question of whether the limits on recipients' earnings serve a useful purpose. Says <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Babson </LOCATION>: `` In the 1930s, when the Social Security system originated, the earnings test -LRB- limit -RRB- was included as a way of encouraging older workers to leave the work force to free jobs for younger people. `` In recent years the age distribution of the population has shifted dramatically. Today fewer young workers are entering the work force, and labor shortages are a problem in many cities. `` Although 20 or so bills seeking the elimination of earnings limits have been filed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, this legislation is not considered a high-priority item.''

 From <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s back porch, fields of corn stretch away toward the horizon, a healthy-looking green. But the stalks have no ears. The rains came too late in <LOCATION> Barry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Day by day, as they endure the worst drought of their lifetime, the young farm couple try not to dwell on their worries, especially in front of their two small children. But 4-year-old <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> knows something is wrong. `` There's not a prayer <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> says that he does n't ask for rain,'' <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> says sadly, but with a mother's proud smile. `` He says, ` If there's anything up there, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, let it pour!''' And some rain has come. When a pair of storms roared through in mid-July and dumped 2 inches of rain _ more than farmers here had seen in several months _ the cornstalks shot up a foot in four days. The rain boosted morale. But the Chases know it did not arrive soon enough for most of the 350 acres of corn they farm with <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> Had the skies opened up two weeks earlier, it might have done some good. The two generations of Chases, who live less than a mile apart off a gravel road, will see underdeveloped ears on most plants and none at all on others. Some stalks never made it out of the ground. The soybeans and hay now have a chance at survival _ but only if the rain continues. The helplessness the family feels has taken its toll. `` I've never really thought about doing anything else but farming,'' says <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>, 28, as he relaxes on the living-room couch, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> and 2 -LCB- - year-old <PERSON> Abby </PERSON> wrestling at his feet `` But a year like this one kind of makes you wonder.'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> has been helping his father on the farm ever since he can remember. Now he is a partner. His 30-year-old sister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, lives with her husband and two young children, and his 26-year-old brother, <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON>, works for an insurance company. They both live within an hour's drive of the farm and come over often to help out. `` For me, it just felt right to stay in farming,'' <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> says. But he has felt the temptation to trade in 90-hour weeks of endless chores for a 40-hour week at a factory and more time with his family. It's a temptation he resists. Some days he does n't get to see his daughter at all. She's sleeping when he leaves at 4:30 a.m. to milk the cows, and she's been tucked in for the night by the time he gets home at 9:30 Sometimes, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> must `` baby-sit'' the irrigation system through the night to make sure nothing goes wrong and no water is wasted. `` I probably spend more time with my father than with <PERSON> Dena </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>, who has his father's thick blond hair, fair skin and football player's physique. He and <PERSON> Dena </PERSON>, a pretty brunette, met in high school and were married eight years ago. They are expecting their third child in January. Their 115-year-old, five-bedroom farmhouse needs paint, and the rickety stairs out back need fixing. But inside, bunches of dried flowers hang from the ceiling, and art and ornaments grace the walls. The same attention to detail can be seen in <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>'s home, right down to the flagpole and Old Glory outside. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> find time together when they can. <PERSON> Dena </PERSON>, 27, sometimes packs lunches and takes the children out to where <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> is working in the fields, and they share a picnic. During spring planting, the children spent long hours with their parents in the cab of a tractor. Neither <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> nor his father can find the words to explain fully the sense of pride they feel in owning and cultivating land. But the pride seems to more than make up for the stress that, even in good times, accompanies it. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> beams as he watches <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> play with a miniature <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> tractor in his sandbox. `` He does everything his dad does,'' <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> says. The farming operation is based at <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s home. As cows graze outside, a computer terminal inside shows the changing prices corn, soybeans and other commodities on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's a lot of stress involved when your business is based at home,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> says. `` It seems salesmen always pull in when you're halfway through your meal. ... That's probably why vacations are so important to us.'' It's also probably why <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> plan to build a home nearby, `` but not on this road,'' when they're ready to retire. That's when <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dena </PERSON> will move into their house. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> believe their son and daughter-in-law will build a better, but not necessarily bigger farm when they take over. `` We see something different in their generation _ they have different priorities,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> says. `` Maybe seeing our parents come through the Depression, we thought bigger was better. But they do n't _ maybe after witnessing all the hard times we've had.'' This year will surely stick in their memories. The drought's final impact will not be known until the harvest is finished in late fall. Much still depends on whether the rain continues. `` All we can do,'' says <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, `` is wait and hope.''

 Finding a reliable auto mechanic, a big problem for many people while at home, can be even more taxing while traveling. While honest service stations can be found, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> warns that there are some unscrupulous shops that overcharge for repairs and recommend unnecessary work, especially when dealing with motorists from another state, warns the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> urge having the car checked out by a local mechanic before embarking on a vacation or other trip, just to head off any developing problems. In particular, have the mechanic check the cooling system, brakes, fan and power belts and tires, since these are the most common items that break down. Make sure the spare tire is fully inflated too, and have the mechanic check for proper wheel alignment and balance. Both <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION> and AAA remind motorists to stay with their cars while stopping at unfamiliar service stations. If someone needs to use the bathroom or walk the dog, take turns, they advise. Check your water and oil levels each morning before starting out, as well as the tire pressure. Properly inflated tires can prevent accidents, increase tread life and stretch out gas mileage, reports the Tire Industry Safety Council. The <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> advises motorists to be suspicious of any attendant who seems to go out of his way to inspect the car while pumping gas. <ORGANIZATION> Geico </ORGANIZATION> warns that occasionally an attendant will create a problem by cutting a fan belt or splashing some oil on the shock absorbers to make it appear there is a leak. To avoid problems: If the car does break down, get a written estimate explaining exactly what is to be done before any work starts, and get a signed receipt for the work. If the car is not disabled, consider getting a second opinion on the problem and the cost of repairs. Make certain any old parts are actually replaced, not merely cleaned and put back in the car. Ask for the removed items, take them home with you and have a mechanic inspect them to see if they really needed to be replaced. If a repair shop refuses to provide a written estimate or to return replaced parts, have the work done somewhere else, even if the car has to be towed, <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> says. Check with a local AAA office for recommendations. Local Better Business Bureaus and consumer affairs offices can help with warnings about shops that have generated many complaints.

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> is so single-minded about his religious beliefs that he welcomes ridicule and willingly risks physical abuse to preach the Gospel where and whenever he sees the need, whether it's in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant or on a crowded city street. He even has a mini-sermon on his telephone answering machine. `` The Bible says repent ye, therefore, and be converted that your sins be blotted out,'' begins the taped message to those who phone his rented home in this western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mountain town. Strode, 40, is a dark-haired, powerfully built man, a skilled machinist and a non-stop talker. For the past three months, he has been mostly talking about the controversy which erupted last spring when his sons began preaching on their elementary school playground, calling their teachers and classmates `` whoremongers'' and `` fornicators,'' among other things. Strode says he sees his actions, and those of his children, as the living testimony and witness of `` totally saved Christians.'' Others in the community see the <LOCATION> Strodes </LOCATION> as the most frustrating and infuriating people they've ever encountered. They describe the father as a know-it-all zealot who likes to spout scripture and loves the attention his actions, and those of his children, bring to the family. `` The media has made a big deal out of the <LOCATION> Strodes </LOCATION> and it has gone to their heads,'' asserts <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>, an area resident. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON> ruefully recalls the day last spring at <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, when she attempted to present Strode with a parents' petition. It asked Strode to restrain his sons, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, 11, and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 5, who were attracting hordes of reporters with their preaching and screeching on the school grounds. `` He simply would n't listen,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Mahan </PERSON>, who has a child at the school. `` We only wanted him to control his children and have them quit disrupting the school, but he just laughed and called me a ` Jezebel' and a lot worse.'' She paused, then added, `` I'll tell you one thing: nobody wants anything to do with him anymore, or those kids either.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, managing editor of The <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>'s daily newspaper, says the <LOCATION> Strodes </LOCATION> have upset practically everyone in the community. `` It's not the fact that the Strodes preach that upsets people,'' he added. `` It's where they do it and how they do it and what they call people. For example, the teachers really got upset after the boys started calling them whores and fornicators, as you might imagine.'' The Strodes appear to have little or no support even among fundamentalist Christians locally, he said. Strode himself, who swears by the King <PERSON> James </PERSON> version of the Bible and calls everything else `` trash,'' readily acknowledges that he has become a pariah among Marion's 3,000 residents. `` A guy came at me with a crowbar the other night, while me and another preacher was preaching from the back of a pickup truck down at the Pizza Hut parking lot,'' he said. `` They're trying to run us out of town. `` I was laid off from my job in May. The bosses at the plant deny it, but I know it was because of my preaching. Now, nobody will give me a job, even though I have 20 years of experience and there's a need for machinists in this area.'' He also says the Rev. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, pastor of <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where his family has attended for the past 18 months, recently asked him not to come back. `` He said we were hurting the church,'' Strode said. `` Can you believe that? Here I am living a good Christian life and preaching the Gospel and they ask me and my kids not to come back.'' Castle has said publicly that his congregation is taking flak because of the Strodes' actions. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, the assistant pastor, said Strode repeatedly refused requests to tone down his preaching style, especially his tendency to call passersby names. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> is a very tough case,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` It's a real shame about those kids but I feel the church not only went the extra mile with Strode, but three extra miles; it's just that he seems to think differently from most other people.'' Strode, who has been on several television and radio talk shows in recent weeks, says he is beginning to believe <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> is a `` bad'' community. `` The world is a wicked place,'' he said as he sat in his living room. `` It's plain to see. The same thing happened to us up in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, before we came down here.'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, his 27-year-old wife and mother of <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and daughter Pepper, says she fully supports the preachings of her husband and sons. She also says her husband and sons, who literally scream when they preach, are loving and soft-spoken at home. `` It's just that they have to change, sort of fill themselves with anger, when they're preaching,'' she said. `` It's like they have to hate the world to be able to see the wickedness that's everywhere around us. Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON> says her children get their religious convictions and preaching style from their father, who was `` saved'' eight years ago while watching television back home in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, a hamlet near <LOCATION> Chambersburg </LOCATION>. Recalling the incident, she said, `` It was late one night and he was turning the dial, looking for something to watch. He found what he thought was a horror show but it turned out to be the Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> VanImpe </PERSON>, an evangelist from <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who's known as the ` living Bible' because he can recite the entire New Testament. `` After hearing VanImpe, my husband got a Bible and began reading it day and night. In about two weeks he was totally saved.''

 Mrs. <PERSON> Strode </PERSON>, who said she met her husband in a <LOCATION> Chambersburg </LOCATION> barroom when she was 15 and married him a year later, acknowledges she resisted the Lord for years after her husband and children were converted. `` I even left one time, for 18 months, because I could n't take the constant preaching anymore,'' she said. `` During that time I lived like a whore, with seven or eight different men. I was trying to see what the world had to offer but I realized it did n't have anything for me, and I came back to my family. A few months after that I was saved.'' The family moved from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in January 1987. `` Everything we had was piled up on top of a flatbed truck,'' she said. `` We looked like ol' <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Clampett </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hillbillies </LOCATION> when we hit town.'' Strode and his wife are natives of the <LOCATION> Chambersburg </LOCATION> area, just north of the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> line. `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> quit school in the 12th grade because she was pregnant with our second child, but I'm a high school graduate,'' he said. He said he went to high school in <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, living in a children's home after his mother's death when he was 14. He spent two years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and served a four-year machinist's apprenticeship, he said. `` I used to be a drunken fornicator, but I always worked and made good money.'' Strode says he came to <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> after hearing a taped sermon by <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>. `` Things were n't going so good in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> for us and I really liked <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>'s preaching,'' he said. `` But now I'm not so sure that he's really, truly saved.'' In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Strode was twice arrested while preaching, charged with disturbing the peace, and he in turn accused <LOCATION> Chambersburg </LOCATION> officials in a suit of violating his First Amendment rights. The charges and the suit were eventually dropped, with the city agreeing to pay his lawyer's fees. Will there be more trouble when public school starts up again, on Aug. 22? `` We may send the kids to school or we may try and teach them at home, if we can get together the money for the books and so forth,'' he said. Asked what their response will be should the Strode children resume their preaching on school grounds this fall, <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> school officials would say only that they intend to enforce school regulations to the letter. Those rules say children must go directly into the school when they arrive. The Strode boys refused to go inside immediately, instead preaching outside until the bell rang. `` Frankly, I'm afraid they might suspend my kids, like they did last spring, and then try to take them away from me,'' Strode says. `` I love my kids and that's something I could never allow to happen. `` Who knows? We're in the process of building a house. Maybe we'll just sell it and move away. Somebody probably would buy it in a minute, just to get rid of us.'' If the Strodes do leave <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Chambersburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, he hopes they do n't return to his community. `` Strode's a terribly disrupitve influence,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He used to go up and down our main street, screaming at the top of his voice, calling people whores and whoremongers and so forth. `` It's much quieter here since the <PERSON> Strodes </PERSON> left the area and, frankly, we hope they never return.''

<HEAD>Giant Drugstore Chain Files For Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOROTHY GAST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Revco D.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to pay the huge debt incurred in its 1986 leveraged buyout has forced the giant drugstore chain into federal bankruptcy protection, and illustrated the potential risks to companies and investors involved in such transactions. Revco D.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 2,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drugstores in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, Southeast and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, filed for protection from creditors Thursday, just over a month after failing to make a $ 46 million interest payment to holders of bonds issued to finance the $ 1.5 billion buyout, the largest ever to fail. Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, told a news conference that holders of $ 400 million in junk bonds accelerated the payment schedule after <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> missed the interest payment June 15. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued to fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or sale of its assets. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout foundered as increased competition and sluggish cash flow crippled the company's ability to cover its obligations. Against a tide of new discount operations and supermarkets adding pharmacies, <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> tried to slash prices and move beyond drugs to big-ticket items like small appliances. Lately, as those efforts faltered, it refocused on its core drugstore business. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>, which has annual sales of $ 2.3 billion, fills more than 65 million prescriptions a year. `` <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s leveraged buyout did n't work out, and hundreds more have,'' Sells said. `` Junk bonds have been the best investment on Wall Street ... but if you'd only invested in one junk bond you'd be pretty unhappy if it was <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>.'' D.S. Partners of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> owns controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>, Sells said. When the drugstore chain missed its June 15 interest payment, bondholders established a steering committee that contacted the company. Proposed talks over having <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> turn over stock to satisfy the debt broke down before they even started, Sells said. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> has been `` husbanding'' cash the past few days to meet its payroll and to pay venders who sell to the company after Thursday's Chapter 11 filing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s two largest venders reacted well to news of the bankruptcy filing, Sells said. He said the reorganization might disrupt shipments from a vender or two, but he does not expect much change in day-to-day operations. The company does not play to lay off any of its 28,000 employees because of Chapter 11 and has received court permission to continue payments of salary and benefits, Sells said. The Chapter 11 filing includes <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>; its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> ANAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and most of its subsidiary operations. <ORGANIZATION> Insta-Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is not included, the company said. The filing allows <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> to obtain new credit and invoices for goods and services, and requires the company to submit to bankruptcy court a reorganization plan restructuring the company's debt

<TEXT>
 A partnership bidding $ 2.46 billion to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may have to raise its offer to satisfy shareholders, some industry analysts say. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that its board would meet Aug. 8 to consider the $ 64 a share bid made by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based limited partnership. Wall Street indicated it believed bids for the apparel and home furnishings manufacturing and retailing company. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock soared $ 13.37 -LCB- a share to close at $ 67.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s best known brand names include <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog clothes, <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> and Converse shoes and <PERSON> Broyhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> said it already owned 8.7 percent, or 3.14 million, of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 38.4 million outstanding shares. City Capital listed its principals as <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>. They are respectively the chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION> Danaher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based manufacturer of automotive and industrial products and vinyl building materials. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, a securities analyst in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office of <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lemon </LOCATION>, expressed confidence in the Raleses ability to attract financial backing for what looks to be a highly-leveraged bid for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>. City Capital said it did not have financing commitments for the proposed buyout, but said it was confident of being able to arrange them. The partnership said that if it succeeded in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>, it planned to sell the apparel business and was considering the sale of parts of its general retail merchandising and footwear manufacturing and retailing businesses. But City Capital left open the possibility that it might reach `` a different conclusion as to which of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- assets might be retained or sold'' after a review of the company's assets, operations and policies. In a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> also said it might increase its offer based on a further review of information about the target company. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said he believed <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> was worth more than the City Capital offer. `` I think a fair value is somewhere around $ 67,'' he said. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, who said <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s footwear and furniture segments were its most valuable divisions, said the company likely would want to remain independent. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Newhard </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying he would be surprised if <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> was receptive to the offer, even if <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> offered to keep <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> management intact Day said recent actions by <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> were defensive moves designed to boost the price of its stock and make a takeover attempt more expensive. The company announced earlier this month it was considering selling its apparel manufacturing group as part of a restructuring that began in 1985. `` I think it's a real question whether <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> is interested,'' Day said. `` I would doubt it.'' In addition to its manufacturing operations, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> operates 201 retail locations in 15 states, including home-improvement centers, general merchandise discount stores, men's specialty apparel shops and specialty department stores. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 3.34 billion last year, with the apparel group contributing about 24 percent. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s performance `` has n't done as well as it could in recent years'' and its stock price had languished.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose against most major currencies in modest trading today but traders predicted fear of central bank intervention would limit the currency's upswing. Gold prices fell slightly. Foreign exchange dealers said end-of-the-month commercial requirements and technical short-covering nudged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency up in early trading. The dealers said dollar demand stemmed largely from corporate customers who needed to cover their commercial obligations before the end of the month. Some market operators were covering short-dollar positions, or buying dollars to fulfill agreements to sell them, ahead of the weekend as well, they said. Italian traders, however, predicted the market would not see a significant rise in the dollars this session because fear of central bank intervention inspired some caution. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7170, compared with $ 1.7225 Thursday. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.8764 West German marks, up from 1.8645; 1.5615 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3280 French francs, up from 6.2885; 2.1088 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0920; 1,386.00 Italian lire, up from 1,370.50; 1.2100 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2086 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, whose business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to close at 132.53. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 131.92 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 432.10 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 433. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 432.70 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 432.25, down from $ 432.50 late Thursday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid price of $ 434.48, up from Thursday's closing bid price of $ 433.78. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.82 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $ 6.79.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar dipped slightly in afternoon trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today but closed higher at 132.53 yen, while stocks continued to rise. The dollar, which opened trading at 132.60 yen, finished 0.43 yen higher than Thursday's close of 132.10 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 57.52-point winner Thursday, gained another 115.54 points, or 0.42 percent, to finish the day's trading at 27,911.63. After opening slightly above the 28,000 mark, the most widely followed barometer on the exchange remained higher than 28,000 through most of the morning session, but edged down in afternoon dealings. It was the first time the index exceeded 28,000 points since July 15. The Nikkei has fluctuated at the mid - and low-27 ,000 level over the past two The market was helped in part by an overnight gain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, traders said. Financials such as banks closed higher, led by <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. Also among gainers were heavy industrials such as Ishikawajima-Harima, <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> and Shipbuilding. Electricals fell back after early gains as some investors took profits. `` It has been an established pattern that if market opens higher, it declines because of profit-taking,'' said a broker at a major securities firm who would not be quoted by name. `` But the environment is good and the dollar seems stable for some time.'' Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's strength to reduced concern about growing inflation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency rose 1.05 yen to close at 132.60 yen.

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are promising to iron out <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> differences over a $ 6 billion drought-relief package in a quick flurry of action next week and speed the measure on to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk. `` My opinion is that the president would accept this bill as it is passed today, although there have been some things he objects to,'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., said Thursday after 94-0 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passage of the bill The House had approved its version 368-29 a few hours earlier after scaling back a plan to increase milk price supports, a proposal widely criticized as excessively favoring the dairy industry. The revised version would impose a temporary increase for three months next year. Milk price supports previously had been scheduled to decrease on Jan. 1. Senators tightened up a similarly controversial benefit in their bill that would allow companies that make ethanol for fuel to buy corn from government surplus bins at what could shape up as a substantial discount. However, there were still warnings that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was flirting with budget trouble by inserting special benefits for constituents back home into the measure. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, urged by <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, acted to cap the price tag of its bill at $ 5.8 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had no comparably firm figure. Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, said latest estimates put the cost of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure at between $ 5.85 billion and $ 6.55 billion. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> warned that running over a $ 5.8 billion ceiling calculated under the Gramm-Rudman budget law would set off nasty fiscal and political repercussions. At the heart of the bill are provisions that would provide disaster payments to farmers equal to 65 percent of losses beyond 35 percent of expected harvest. Many dairy and livestock producers would become eligible for benefits under an expanded government feed aid program. Farmers especially hard hit by the drought would get supplemental payments under both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills. A number of other points remain to be resolved when lawmakers meet in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee next week. The House version requires farmers to buy federal crop insurance for each of the next two years if they are to be eligible for disaster payments this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version does not contain such a provision, which is opposed by both the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and a wide array of major crop producer groups. Both bills would cancel a 50-cent cut in the milk price-support level scheduled for Jan. 1 but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version would go beyond that. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision would raise the price-support level from April through June 1989 by 50 cents, to $ 11.10 cents for each 100 pounds of milk. Dairy-state lawmakers wanted even more, pushing for a permanent increase. `` This is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent,'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., said in opposing the measure He said it was unfair to provide such aid to dairymen and not also to cattle, sheep and poultry producers, who must pay the same increased feed costs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, voted 217-181 for the temporary increase, a compromise sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>. House conferees are going to be looking hard at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision that would allow the nation's ethanol makers to purchase surplus grain from government bins at 110 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition Much of the government corn was acquired long before the drought pushed up prices. Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, D-S.D., sponsored the measure, but offered a compromise amendment to end the program in September 1989 and cap the amount of corn that could be used at 16 million bushels. By <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>'s calcuation the price break for ethanol makers would be about 10 cents a bushel, although that includes transportation costs and other factors. He said the measure is aimed at helping small ethanol producers, but it also would be a boon to the <ORGANIZATION> Archer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daniels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, which produces the lion's share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ethanol House debate began with Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., complaining that a temperature control project to encourage salmon spawning in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> dam had been placed in the bill He demanded to know who `` wants this pork garbage in the bill.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said that the project, a favorite of Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., was intended to assure consumers an adequate supply of food <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., told reporters later that he had tried to keep so-called pork barrel projects out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill `` but some wends its way through despite the tightest security.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says the federal deficit will be $ 5.6 billion higher than it predicted back in February, with the government's red ink now estimated to total $ 152.3 billion this fiscal year. While the new administration estimate announced Thursday is higher, it is still below the more gloomy projections earlier this year by many private economists, who were forecasting a deficit of $ 160 billion or worse. Those economists have been busy revising their own figures, and some now say the administration's new deficit forecast for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 may actually be too pessimistic. As the year began, the administration predicted the overall economy as measured by the gross national product would expand at a sluggish 2.4 percent rate. The new budget has boosted that GNP estimate to 3 percent. The higher growth this year has helped push the unemployment rate down to a 14-year-low of 5.3 percent. More people working means more tax revenues for Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Tax revenues are expected to be $ 4.2 billion higher than the administration's February projection, according to the new report. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, said he is now predicting the 1988 deficit will total $ 145 billion based on the gains in tax revenues which have already occurred. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he is forecasting a deficit this year of $ 151 billion, slightly lower than the administration's estimate. The administration is calling for the deficit in the next fiscal year to decline to $ 140.1 billion, an estimate that private economists say is generally in line with their own forecasts. That deficit estimate is $ 5.9 billion below the $ 146 billion level which would trigger automatic spending cuts as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. However, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> warned that the $ 5.9 billion cushion did not leave much room for error, especially given a lengthy list of spending measures <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering in an election year. The measure with the highest price tag is a drought-relief package for farmers, which <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> estimated would cost the government between $ 4.3 billion and $ 6.6 billion. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> supports drought relief but is opposed to using `` the plight of the farmers as an opportunity to make a Christmas tree out of that bill'' by loading it up with other farm assistance that has little to do with drought relief. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also listed as potential budget-busters measures to step up the battle against illegal drugs and provide more aid the hungry and homeless. He said if all the proposals were enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it would increase spending between $ 6.4 billion and $ 8.7 billion, enough even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the automatic spending cuts. `` We ca n't do all the things that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has on its list right now,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told reporters at a White House briefing. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., agreed that the administration's mid-session review points up the need for lawmakers to make tough choices in coming weeks `` All of the urgent needs of the nation can not be funded at the levels most of us would support in less difficult times,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he doubted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would risk triggering the across-the-board spending cuts, especially since they would take effect only weeks before the November election. `` I think <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is trying to hold people's feet to the fire so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does n't go crazy with the drought bill, but it would snow in July before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would allow across-the-board spending cuts to go into effect,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said that last year, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> faced similar budget problems, it found a way to keep within the deficit targets by pushing $ 5 billion in spending from September to October, the start of a new fiscal year. He said if necessary, lawmakers would resort to similar budgetary tricks this year to escape mandatory spending cuts. The administration's mid-session budget review projected that the budget deficit would decline steadily in coming years. It forecast a 1990 deficit, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accepts its proposals on further spending cuts, of $ 102.3 billion, declining to $ 85.4 billion in 1991, $ 64.9 billion in 1992 and $ 34.2 billion in 1993, the year the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law calls for the budget to be brought finally into balance.

<HEAD>Takeshita Calls on Parliament to Reform Tax System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s legislators Friday that tax reform is the most important domestic issue facing the nation, and urged them to approve the first major overhaul of the tax system since it was set up by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation forces in 1950 In a speech before the Japanese parliament, the Diet, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> delivered a strong appeal for passage of a tax reform package he has pinpointed as a top item on his political agenda. `` There is an urgent need to rectify -LRB- distortions of the present tax system -RRB- to institute a new tax system that is fair, simple and acceptable to the people,'' he said. Tax reform has been long awaited by the average Japanese salary-earner who bears a heavy direct tax burden, compared to self-employed individuals and other categories of taxpayers who are eligible for substantial tax breaks. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said that if his package is approved taxpayers will win an unprecedented amount in tax cuts totaling 5.6 trillion yen, the equivalent of $ 43 billion, for fiscal 1988 ending next March. But a shadow already looms over the tax reform plan. Opposition parties refused to open Diet proceedings until the prime minister's ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> agreed to substantial tax cuts. They are also demanding the government scrap plans to introduce an indirect consumption tax of 3 percent on goods and services next April. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> indicated he was prepared to compromise: `` It is important that the tax burden be passed along smoothly and justly, and the administration will work to create the right environment for this.'' Earlier Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> approved six tax bills making up <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s reform package due for debate in the Diet in upcoming weeks. The new plan calls for reducing the 12 brackets in the progressive income tax system, with rates ranging from 10.5 percent to 60 percent, to five brackets ranging from 10 to 50 percent. Residential taxes would also be reduced and corporate taxes would drop from 42 percent to 37.5 percent. Eight categories of goods and services have been earmarked as non-taxable, including medical care, education costs and capital gains from land transactions. The 70-day extraordinary Diet session opened Tuesday after a one-week delay and after an agreement by the ruling party to investigate two recent developments: the role of a government submarine in a marine disaster last Saturday and the recent disclosure of unethical stock deals that reaped massive profits for government officials, including a <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> aide. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> opened his speech with an apology over the collision between a military submarine and a leisure vessel that claimed 30 civilian lives. He also alluded to the legal but shady stock purchases in which selected individuals were offered shares of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a real estate firm, prior to their release for over-the-counter dealings. `` We must always be mindful of political ethics and self-discipline in government service ... and it is imperative that we continually fulfill our responsibilities without even a hint of impropriety,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. The scandal involves more than a dozen prominent political and business leaders suspected of earning huge profits by obtaining the unlisted shares and then selling them after they were released on the market. To date, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> have admitted their aides at the time earned profits. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, however, it generally known that aides act on behalf of the politicians they serve.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Rises From Previous Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> posted a current account surplus of $ 6.43 billion in June, up 11 percent from the previous month but down 14 percent from the same month last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday. In May, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus totaled $ 5.79 billion, while in June 1987 it registered $ 7.5 billion. The current account is the broadest measure of a country's commerce, measuring trade in goods and services as well as other capital flows Ministry officials said imports continued to rise sharply during the month. But they said exports also increased, continuing the double-digit rise that began last November despite the higher value of the Japanese yen. The officials said demand remained strong for Japanese products in other countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy has been doing very well and that is one of the major reasons for this increase, despite the yen's appreciation,'' one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity A higher yen makes Japanese products more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas. The officials said demand remained especially high for Japanese items such as automobiles, steel, semiconductors and business machines. Japanese imports have been growing because of strong domestic demand resulting from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current economic expansion and because of the higher yen, which tends to reduce the cost of foreign products. Growth of imports of non-ferrous metals, lumber and steel was particularly strong during the month, the officials said. Record numbers of Japanese tourists traveling overseas, taking advantage of the yen's appreciation, helped reduce the current account surplus, the officials said. The portion of the current account measuring flows of money related to tourism, shipping, insurance, banking and commodity services showed a record deficit of $ 737 million during the month, they said. In May, the figure was $ 612 million, and in June 1987 it was $ 251 million.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> said he expects the price of oil to rise in coming weeks because of the possibility of an end to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war, according to a report published Friday. Statements by <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, who heads the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, were published in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was in the emirates for discussions on the oil market situation with U.A.E. leaders in advance of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> pricing committee meeting in <LOCATION> Lausanne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Aug. 3. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> as saying the world market `` looks forward to positive results'' from the pricing committee. It said he expressed his expectation of an increase in oil prices over the coming weeks. In <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s view, the paper said, prices have been improving because of the prospects of a peaceful end to the nearly 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. That settlement would lead to a positive impact on the oil market and oil prices, the paper further quoted <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> as saying. But it said he could not predict whether prices would increase beyond the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark of $ 18 a barrel. The pricing committee, whose members are oil ministers of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, was meeting in wake of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s decision to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution to end its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> has toured <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states seeking assurances about compliance with the cartel's production quotas to help stabilize oil prices around the $ 18 benchmark. Because of the war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to accept its OPEC-decreed quota and produces almost double what it is assigned. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is widely accused of discounting prices to market its crude oil under the wartime conditions. That could change if the war came to an end, fueling hopes that prices could rise. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member states have also violated the cartel's production and pricing rules In June, the U.A.E. said it would ignore its <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil production quota of 948,000 barrels and produce about 1.5 million barrels per day. <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> has conferred with U.A.E. Oil Minister <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON> and with U.A.E. President <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Nahyan </PERSON> to whom he delivered a message from the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> president and <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> oil minister, <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>. The official Emirates news agency <ORGANIZATION> WAM </ORGANIZATION> reported after the meetings Thursday that <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> affirmed his nation's support for `` unity and cohesion'' within <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Japan's First-Half Automobile Exports Down 5.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exports of four-wheeled automobiles fell 5.1 percent during the first six months of this year from the same period of 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The association attributed the decline to the Japanese yen's appreciation, which makes Japanese products less competitive abroad Japanese car exports have been declining for two years. The last time auto exports grew from year-earlier levels was in the first half of 1986, when a 5.2-percent increase was reported. Expanding production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Japanese car makers was another factor for the sustained fall in exports, the <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> report said. Exports of four-wheeled autos totaled 3.1 million in the first half, the association said. Auto exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slid 17.5 percent to 1.3 million vehicles, accounting for 40.8 percent of the total shipments to overseas markets. A total of 721,459 vehicles were exported to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, down 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Those to Southeast and Northeast Asian countries, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, dipped 0.4 percent to 219,954 vehicles.

<HEAD>Japan's Unemployment Rate Reaches 67-Month Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High demand for workers resulting from rapid economic growth pushed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate down to 2.4 percent in June, its lowest level in 67 months, the government announced Friday. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for June was 0.1 percentage point lower than in May and 0.6 percentage points below the previous year's level, the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Many companies were eager to hire new workers because of the economy's continuing expansion,'' an agency official said. The number of job holders during the month totaled nearly 61.1 million, equaling the record set in May, the agency said. The number represented an increase of 1.1 million jobs from June 1987. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a sizable number of workers had left their jobs voluntarily during the month. The number of jobs increased in virtually all sectors except for agriculture, which experienced a drop of 1.4 percent, or 70,000 jobs, from the previous year, the agency said. Agency officials said the last time an unemployment rate of 2.4 percent was registered was in November 1982. A record low of 1.0 percent was set on three occasions: November 1968, November 1969 and March 1971. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate would be higher if it were calculated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European methods. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, armed forces personnel and people who work more than one hour in the last week of the month, when statistics are tabulated, are counted as employed. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, military personnel are not considered part of the labor force, and those who work less than 15 hours a week are considered unemployed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today a planned $ 660 million leveraged buyout of its chemicals business has fallen through. The announcement came a day after sources disclosed new concerns about the segment's environmental liabilities that jeopardized the planned sale of the business to a group led by its management. British businessman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> had counted on the sale of the business to help finance his $ 1.8 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> was going to sell the business segment, he would have retained responsibility for its past environmental liabilities. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in chemicals industry buyouts, was to be an equity partner with management. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said it is now free to consider other offers for the business. `` We have received a number of inquiries relating to this transaction over a period of several months,'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said this morning by telephone from <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' headquarters in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` We have not pursued those inquiries because of our undertaking to give exclusivity to the management group,'' he said. `` It is our intention to seek purchasers of a serious nature immediately, and that is already under way.'' We do not expect any difficulty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, who prevailed June 1 in a bitter takeover battle against <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' former top management, declined today to say whether he intends to sell the chemicals group as an entity or in pieces. He said Thursday that discussions about the chemicals buyout were continuing. But those last-ditch efforts proved fruitless. One official at <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, who would not speak for attribution, said managers of the chemicals segment were being told that a financial consultant to the deal had raised new concerns about the extent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' environmental liabilities. That apparently created differences over the agreed purchase price. Breaking up the chemicals group would be a blow to the nearly 2,700 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> employees who were expected to keep their jobs after the buyout. The <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> company also has major interests in construction materials, which <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> wanted as an addition to his international construction operations. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON>, slated to move from <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer to president and chief executive of the new company, on Thursday referred questions to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION>. A Wall Street securities analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> said he was not surprised by the reports that environmental issues were at the root of the problem, although he said he was unaware of the snag. `` The company does n't know what the liabilities are. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> gets around to these plent sites one at a time, and until they get around to some of these places, you do n't know,'' he said, speaking on condition he not be named. The analyst said <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> `` is a smart guy and usually he sets these deals so that the environmental liabilities are covered. He's been careful about that because it's sucn an open-ended thing.'' Selling the chemicals businesses in pieces `` would take longer, but they might get a better price,'' he said. In the battle against the <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> group, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' former top management argued in court documents that with environmental liabilities of $ 200 million over the next decade, the chemicals business could not survive without cash from the construction materials business. <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON> has estimated the segment's sales would grow from about $ 600 million in 1987 to $ 1 billion in the 1990s. It had operating profits of around $ 40 million last year.

 Should Americans be advising the Japanese on how to take over American companies? The issue raised a rumpus among Americans in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> recently after the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> sponsored well-attended courses for Japanese businessmen on how to acquire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Representatives of several state offices complained that such seminars were against the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, and both of the sponsors had to defend the seminars. `` To have a seminar here in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a three-hour seminar, and not touch on the subject of hostile takeovers would be incomplete,'' answered <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, adding that the Chamber was not promoting hostile takeovers. The debate over Japanese takeovers is gaining momentum both here and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as Japanese investors expand their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests beyond government securities and real estate. Just last week, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest securities house, bought a 20 percent stake in <LOCATION> Wasserstein </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hottest merger-and-acquisition firms. Speakers at the Japanese seminars described how to target <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies for acquisition, how to prepare proxy statements for the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, and ways to avoid antagonizing American employees and customers of the companies they are taking over. Also covered were such subjects as how to conduct friendly, neutral or hostile takeovers. An accountant told the businessmen how to spot companies in trouble, a businessman told them how to recognize and avoid bluffs by American companies, and another participant advised the Japanese that they often paid more for American companies than necessary. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s representative office in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said the state offices association `` has no business teaching Japanese how to take over an American company, whether or not it wants to be taken over.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the 39 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states with offices in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to promote trade and investment in their states, sent out a letter saying it does not censor speeches of experts who appear at such seminars. The association does not `` in any way promote hostile takeovers by Japanese companies in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, and data substantiates that this is not even a primary or common form of Japanese investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the letter said. The course was first offered in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, attended by more than 100 persons, many of them Japanese businessmen. Following objections over a portion of the course that dwelt on hostile takeovers, the course was modified and offered again in early July in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, drawing more than 150 businessmen, most of them Japanese. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said mergers and acquisitions are a fact of life in American business, and the seminars were designed to make the Japanese better informed. The controversy placed the Chamber in an awkward situation, because it wants to guide the Japanese in investing their surplus cash in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and thus to stave off protectionist sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and many American companies have welcomed Japanese investment, as long as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> management is left intact, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consultants are active in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> advising the Japanese on takeover prospects. So far, Japanese companies have been content to play the role of `` white knights'' who rescue companies from unwanted invaders. However, participants at the seminars urged the Japanese to be more aggressive and seek out companies that might be ripe for mergers. <PERSON> Mie </PERSON> <PERSON> Teno </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Invest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, told the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> seminar that mergers and acquisitions are a good way to get into business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> quickly and without a lot of startup costs. Compared with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where takeovers are commonplace and even the biggest corporations are targets, there are few takeovers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Japanese companies tend to hold large blocks of each other's stock permanently, creating alliances and making it difficult to mount a hostile takeover attempt. <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> said Japanese companies have a paternalistic feeling toward their employees and believe that selling part of their company is like selling a member of the family. `` Not only would this not happen in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, government and businesses would work together to prevent it,'' the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> representative said. According to <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Japanese companies concluded 469 mergers and acquisitions in 1987, and 451 in 1986. Of those mergers, more than 200 each year were outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Last year, for the first time, foreign takeovers by Japanese companies exceeded domestic takeovers. Only about 22 foreign companies in 1986 and 25 in 1987 were able to acquire Japanese companies, according to an investment broker who asked that he not be identified. The first foreign hostile takeover bid against a major Japanese firm ended in failure last year when <ORGANIZATION> Trafalgar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> sold the shares they had acquired in the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Minebea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese government had decided that much of <ORGANIZATION> Minebea </ORGANIZATION>'s business was defense-related and should not be sold to an outsider.

 The stock market moved sharply higher in moderate trading today as gains in the bond market buoyed investor enthusiasm for equities. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 33.60 to 2,115.93 at midafternoon. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 12 to 5 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 984 issues up, 413 down and 484 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 133.36 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. The Dow opened higher and advanced in a measured manner, piercing the 2,100 level at midday. `` We'll see if this market can hang on,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandenberg </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the gains reflected fresh strength in the bond market In addition, investors continued to react favorably to comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who indicated Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has n't changed monetary policy recently. `` Those comments encouraged people to believe interest rates are not going to go up any further and maybe even go down,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. With the spotlight off interest rates, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said investors were able to turn their attention to the flood of positive corporate earnings reports that have been pouring in over the past few weeks `` We've had very good earnings, but most of the stocks did not participate last week'' because of fear that higher interest rates would dilute corporate profits down the road, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. Much of the day's activity centered on blue-chip issues. Strategies to capture quarterly dividends also accounted for a fair share of overall volume. Technology issues, often a leading force in the stock market, were showing strength. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 | at 125 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million common shares, was up 1 ~ at 23 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was up ~ at 45 -LCB- amid rumors the company may sell its household products division for as much as $ 2 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, which was unchanged at 15, was the most active issue with 22 million shares changing hands as traders moved to capture the utility's quarterly dividend.

<HEAD>Dukakis Allies With Management In Fighting Hostile Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> made a hostile bid to seize <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> engineered passage of a state anti-takeover law and signed it with fanfare on a <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> softball fied. When <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to review the $ 6.6 billion purchase, which included <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s Basement, the discount store where the governor buys his suits. On the campaign trail, the Democratic presidential nominee has said `` merger-mania'' is `` tearing companies apart as if they were erector sets.'' And he has called for tougher enforcement of federal antitrust laws and regulations to protect management against takeover artists seeking to make a fast buck. In a state where sharks circle regularly around corporate giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, portrayed as a liberal by his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents, has forged an alliance with management in attacking corporate raiders. `` He's very concerned about hostile takeovers that lead to protracted battles, cost jobs, might result in paying greenmail and do n't create new economic value,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Rosabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanter </PERSON>. `` However, he's very well aware that there are a large number of mergers and acquisitions and some takeovers that replace weak management with stronger management or result in combinations that do create new economic value,'' the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser said this past week. Wall Street analysts acknowledge some trepidation among potential buyers over a possible <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency. Some fear he will try to curb takeovers; others worry that a recession will dampen the merger wave, as it did after last year's stock market crash. With the future uncertain, merger activity has spurted in recent months. `` There is some basis to say that were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win, then antitrust enforcement would be more vigorous than under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Administration,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabuss </PERSON>, senior vice president for mergers at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But I do n't think <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be Draconian on this. He tends to be middle-of-the-road is my impression.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on the record supporting measures to curb hostile takeovers, including: _ A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., to force raiders to make their efforts more _ Outlawing greenmail, the premium paid by a company to buy back stock from a raider who agrees to drop a takeover bid _ Reducing the 10-day period in which a company can acquire a block of another company's stock without disclosing whether it intends to mount a takeover _ Stricter enforcement of antitrust and insider trading laws _ Barring firms from using pension fund surpluses to repay debts incurred during takeover financing `` I do n't want to stop mergers and acquisitions in this country,'' the candidate told <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine in an interview appearing in the Aug. 8 issue. `` But you've got a lot of responsible business people who would suggest that there are reasonable rules of the game, beginning with antitrust policy that you can believe in.'' In high-tech <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has tried to discourage hostile takeovers that force companies relying on long-term research and development to focus on boosting short-term profits to defend against raiders. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' anti-takeover law followed <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s failed bid for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, in which the personal care giant paid $ 558 million to buy back 9.2 million shares of stock. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> currently is involved in a legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to gain control of the company and sell it to the highest bidder. In February, when <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> came under siege from the <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> co-sponsored legislation giving corporate directors the right to consider the interests of workers, the community and the economy in weighing a takeover. The bill died in committee after the takeover attempt failed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also commissioned a panel from government, business, labor and academia to assess <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' anti-takeover law, similar to ones passed in about 20 other states, and report to him by October. Under the state law, the voting rrs acquiring 20 percent of a company can be suspended for up to 50 days so management and shareholders can evaluate the bid. Opponents maintain that anti-takeover laws strip power from stockholders and allow incumbenights of investot management to perpetuate inefficiency by failing to respond to market forces. `` If they fall short, there's nobody there to snap at their heels and say, ` Improve your performance or we can make more money for the shareholders,''' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lufkin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` They do n't feel the pressure to compete.'' <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>, who supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential bid, said anti-takeover legislation has made strange bedfellows of Democratic politicians like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and typically conservative company management `` I think -LRB- Democratic legislators' -RRB- hearts are with the work force in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, but they are passing laws and giving speeches that essentially protect m <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s history, has benefited more than half a million people since its inception in 1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the countryside.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was higher against major currencies in European markets Friday in expectation of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and despite heavy intervention by central banks. Gold and silver rose. The dollar was bolstered because `` all the signs point to a higher interest rate environment'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefamovicz </PERSON>, a corporate advisor at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. He and other dealers said the market interpreted remarks Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> to mean monetary authorities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are worried about inflationary pressures. In particular, they pointed to <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s comment that he found the 4.1 percent inflation rate in the second quarter, as indicated by the gross national product deflator, `` a bit surprising.'' Dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said repeated dollar sales by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Nederlandsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> could not contain the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's strength Both the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italy </ORGANIZATION> and the Swiss monetary authorities also confirmed their intervention. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7105, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.7225 Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday rates, included: 1.8750 West German marks, up from 1.8645; 1.5615 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3202 French francs, up from 6.2885; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0920; 1,377.75 Italian lire, up from 1,370.50; 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2086. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 132.53. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.05 yen. The spot price of gold rose on technical factors, although trading was generally quiet, traders in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> said. Dealers said that after gold broke through the $ 435 level in the European afternoon, the outlook for the price improved. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 435.25 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 433. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid of $ 436.50 compared with $ 432.50 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid price of $ 434.48, up from Thursday's closing bid price of $ 433.78. Later, silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.81 a troy ounce, up from Thursday's $ 6.79.

 The stock market moved sharply higher in moderate trading today as fears of higher interest rates abated, whetting investors' appetite for equities. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 36.27 at 2,118.60 an hour before the closing bell. Gainers outnumbered losers by roughly 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,110 issues up, 358 down and 456 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 159.65 million shares as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The Dow opened higher and advanced in a measured manner, piercing the 2,100 level at midday. Analysts said the gains reflected fresh strength in the bond market. In addition, investors continued to react favorably to comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who indicated Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has n't changed monetary policy recently. `` Those comments encouraged people to believe interest rates are not going to go up any further and maybe even go down,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, chief technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. With the spotlight off interest rates, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said investors were able to turn their attention to the flood of positive corporate earnings reports that have been pouring in over the past few weeks `` We've had very good earnings, but most of the stocks did not participate last week'' because of fear that higher interest rates would dilute corporate profits down the road, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said. Much of the day's activity centered on blue-chip issues. Strategies to capture quarterly dividends also accounted for a fair share of overall volume. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 ~ at 125 |; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million common shares, was up 2 at 23 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 at 45 | amid rumors the company may sell its household products division for as much as $ <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, which was unchanged at 15, was the most active issue with 22 million shares changing hands as traders moved to capture the utility's quarterly dividend. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 2.25 to 152.65. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index stood at 305.39, up 1.76.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Soar Their Limits; Corn Leads Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and sobyean futures scored their first major advance in more than two weeks Friday, closing sharply higher in a rebound sparked by a basketful of bullish factors. `` Mr. Excitement jumped in here today,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Most corn and soybean futures soared their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel while the limitless August soybean contract gained more than 34 cents. After more than a week of generally falling prices across the board, an overnight increase in cash corn prices spurred some hedge-type buying of corn futures by commercial grain dealers and processors, analysts said. The depressed soybean market also attracted bargain hunters while wheat gained on news of a 400,000-metric-ton sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to reduce for next year the portion of the acreage wheat growers must set aside to qualify for federal price supports. A rumor later in the day that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for corn prompted further buying of corn futures. A soybean production estimate of 1.56 billion bushels by meatpacker <ORGANIZATION> Conagra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest estimate of 1.65 billion bushels, added further support to the soybeans, analysts said And private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain this weekend in the drought-stricken Farm Belt lent strength across the board. At the close, wheat was 10 cents to 17 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.68 a bushel; corn was 6 cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 2.75 a bushel; oats were 7 cents to the limit 15 cents higher with September at $ 2.71 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 9 -LCB- cents to 34 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 7.76 a bushel.

 The stock market advanced broadly today as fears of higher interest rates abated and a vibrant technical rally took hold. Analysts said much of the day's gains reflected fresh strength in the credit markets, where bond prices rose and interest rates declined. Stock prices opened higher and advanced in a measured manner throughout the session. Analysts said computer-triggered buy programs helped boost the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials beyond the 2,100 mark, a key pscyhological barrier, at about midday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday announced the collapse of a $ 660 million deal to sell its chemicals division to a management-led group. The sale would have helped British construction magnate <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> finance his $ 1.8 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> said he was optimistic other buyers could be found for the chemicals business. The announcement came a day after sources said that recent concerns about the chemical segment's environmental liabilities were jeopardizing the agreement for <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> to sell the operations to managers and their outside partner. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> and his takeover partners, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> bank, had agreed to remain responsible for the environmental liabilities after the leveraged buyout. <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> expressed confidence Friday that a sale can be arranged with other parties. `` We have received a number of inquiries relating to this transaction over a period of several months,'' he said by telephone from <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` We have not pursued those inquiries because of our undertaking to give exclusivity to the management group. It is our intention to seek purchasers of a serious nature immediately, and that is already under way. We do not expect any difficulty.'' <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> gave the managers the exclusive right to negotiate for the business. The managers will now have to compete with outside bidders if they are to salvage their plan. Asked what killed the management-led buyout, <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> `` you should ask <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>. We have a signed contract and are prepared to honor it.'' <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, head of The Sterling Group of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is a chemicals industry financier. He was an equity partner with the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> managers and was announced as the chairman of the new <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>'s office on Friday referred all questions to <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> president and chief operating officer who was to become president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, was out of his office Friday and not expected back until Monday, a secretary said. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that discussions were continuing, in an apparent last-ditch effort to save the chemicals buyout. After bitter resistance in federal court, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' former top management conceded defeat and agreed June 1 to sell the company for $ 61 per share to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shearon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> wanted <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> in order to add its construction materials business to his international construction operations.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Market Firm In Aftermath Of Revco Filing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first big failure of a leveraged buyout failed to stir the junk-bond market Friday, and analysts predicted the bankruptcy filing by drugstore chain <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> D.S. Inc. would concern few holders of other high-risk corporate bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>, which announced its filing Thursday, is the only major company to seek protection from its creditors after going private in a junk-bond financed buyout. `` Many people had expected it -LRB- the Chapter 11 filing -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waill </PERSON>, managing director and junk bond analyst at <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There had been a general understanding from investors that this was risky ...'' The <LOCATION> Twinsburg </LOCATION>, Ohio-based company failed to make a June interest payment on about $ 700 million in outstanding debt that was used to go private 19 months ago. The company sought protection from creditors after talks with bondholders broke down. `` There was no ripple effect,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, director of high-yield bond research for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. As a result, traders said, prices of most junk bonds remained fairly firm in the secondary market Friday, including some of <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s securities. Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk notes commonly issued to fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or sale of its assets. Some traders and analysts even predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> bonds might rebound after the chain files its reoganization plan with the bankruptcy court and gets back on its feet financially. All of <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s debt had been considered speculative grade, or `` junk,'' a category assigned by the big credit-rating services for companies considered more likely to default on their bonds due to a variety of reasons, including tough economic conditions in a particular industry. Junk bond yields are generally three - to four percentage points higher than comparable <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to compensate for their low rating, making them attractive to some investors The majority of junk bond buyers are large sophisticated institutional investors, rather than individuals, who diversify their portfolios enough to compensate for future risks. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s problem resulted from the heavy debt load incurred as a result of its leveraged buyout in December 1986. The company listed its total debt as $ 1.5 billion in the bankruptcy filing. Chairman Boake A. Sells said Thursday that the company's investment adviser planned to propose a recapitalization that would have swapped equity in <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> for debt, but he said discussions with major bondholders broke down even before the plan was proposed Sells maintained that most of <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,000 drug stores were profitable but that the company was not generating enough cash to both operate its business and make millions of dollars in annual interset payments. <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> is the only leveraged buyout company that has failed to meet its obligations to bondholders, according to <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessol </PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In all of 1987 there was a record $ 9 billion in corporate defaults, she said.

 Oil prices made slight gains Friday in light trading dominated mostly by technical factors. Traders said activity was slowed in advance of the weekend and in anticipation of a possible meeting next week of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s pricing committee. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for September delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade, gained 16 cents to settle at $ 16.31 a barrel. Among refined products, the August contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline attracted the most activity on its last day of trading. The contract lost .21 cent to settle at 51.74 cents per gallon, while prices for later months advanced slightly. The August contract for heating oil, which also expired, gained .32 cent to 44.66 cents per gallon. `` You have a market that's tired of being news generated ... and is trading flat,'' explained <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fired a broker Friday and <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it suspended one in connection with a widening probe of possibly fraudulent trading based on advance leaks of Business Week articles. Another firm, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, disclosed that up to three former brokers may have traded improperly on advance knowledge of the information as well. And R.R. <ORGANIZATION> Donnelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, one of the companies that prints Business Week, said federal authorities had subpoenaed lists of its employees at two printing plants near the offices where the affected brokers worked. The moves came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it had fired a broker because of suspicious trades surrounding stocks touted in Business Week. <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> said it had dismissed <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a broker in its 33-member office in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after it detected questionable trading by him. The firm said it had notified the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that enforces securities laws. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Costiglio </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, 28, had worked for the firm for about 3 -LCB- years. Executives at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> office referred all queries about <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Costiglio </PERSON>, who said he did not know the whereabouts of the broker. Directory assistance said there was no listing for a <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said the broker it suspended worked in the firm's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, where 10 brokers are based. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> declined to disclose the broker's identity or career history. `` The suspension was the result of an internal investigation which we conducted,'' she said. `` We've notified the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation is continuing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that an undisclosed number of ex-brokers in the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, office of <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> acquired last December, `` may have accepted and executed trades based on advance knowledge of articles that were published in Business Week.'' A source at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least one and possibly three brokers were involved, but said their whereabouts were not clear. The statement said the questionable trades occured prior to the acquisition and the brokers are no longer with the company. It said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> had been notified but provided no further details. The disclosures widened to four the number of brokerages involved since Business Week, the nation's leading business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million, said last week it was investigating whether stock trading was occuring based on leaks of its unpublished `` Inside Wall Street'' columns. Evidence uncovered so far suggests that workers who print Business Week shared information about the market-moving columns with brokers before the magazine was available to the public. Two of the four plants that publish Business Week are in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>. Business Week officials have said there is no indication that any of the magazine's editorial staff is involved. Lawyers likened the situation to the securities fraud case brought against former <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, who sold tips about his impending stock columns to broker <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>. Both were convicted for trading based on stolen confidential information. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had fired broker <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> from its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office after investigating a pattern of suspicious trading he conducted on stocks featured in `` Inside Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> did not return phone calls to his home in <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lyme </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, seeking comment. People familiar with <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s internal probe, who spoke on condition they not be identified, also said a second broker in the firm's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was under investigation but no disciplinary action had been taken against him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s secretary said he was unavailable for comment Business Week, published by <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said on July 21 that its legal counsel was examining the entire operation for possible leaks. The magazine has retained a high-powered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> detective agency, <ORGANIZATION> Kroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, to assist its investigation. <PERSON> Kroll </PERSON> has been involved in several major securities probes, particularly those involving insider trading, proxy fights and hostile takeovers. Business Week ackowledged it was investigating possible leaks after Dow Jones Professional Investor Report made the initial disclosure about possible misuse of information in the column. Professional Investor Report said its analysis of 20 stocks mentioned in the column had found at least eight rose sharply the day the magazines came off the presses but before they were available to the public. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the major stock exchanges also are investigating the matter. <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>, which operates the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION> plants, said that it was conducting its own investigation into possible leaks and that anyone accused of wrongdong faced disciplinary action. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Donnelley </PERSON>, said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had subpoenaed lists of employee names and addresses at the two plants and that the firm's own investigators had intervewed more than 21 workers.

<HEAD>Giant Japanese Bond Issue Helps Fill Triple-A Void</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Japanese have invaded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets in a big way again. In Samurai style, <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> issued $ 500 million in 10-year notes _ one of the largest foreign bond issues ever floated in this country, according to its underwriters. The July 19 issue was snapped up by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutional investors hungry for old-fashioned, triple-A bonds, even if they are n't American With a dwindling number of triple-A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate bonds now on the market, analysts say there's plenty of room for `` Yankee bonds'' issued by foreign governments and companies to raise capital _ most of which also carry the top rating. `` Yankee bonds'' are issued in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by foreign entities and regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't see any kind of volume that ca n't be absorbed,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickelson </PERSON>, a senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There have n't been enough -LRB- triple-A -RRB- issues to really saturate the market.'' In recent years, a number of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks that had enjoyed triple-A ratings were stripped of them by the credit-rating agencies after they took steep losses on loans to developing countries. Some big oil companies were similarly downgraded after the world oil price slide in 1985. Even more recently, the surge in corporate takeover activity in this country has brought downgraded ratings for some blue-chip companies that piled up their debt to pay for big acquisitions. `` Dwindling ranks, no question about that,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the number of triple-A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s is one of the top rating agencies, along with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. There are currently 13 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies with triple-A ratings from both <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's, <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> noted, down from 18 in 1981. The survivors include <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and some of the regional telephone companies. There's a peculiar irony here. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial giants, like <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, lost their triple-A imprimaturs largely as a result of competition from Japanese companies. Now, Japanese conglomerates like <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> are jumping into the triple-A void with big bond issues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Like <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, other foreign companies have been raising capital in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with big bond issues. Earlier this month, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 300 million in 10-year notes in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. And the governments of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> recently issued what <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Nickelson </PERSON> calls `` real barn-burners'' _ 40 - and 50-year bonds that fetched high prices Conservative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors `` love the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> bond market,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreicher </PERSON>, an international economist and bond strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. Many of the foreign bonds offer investors high-quality, regulated securities which still sell for less than <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues, <PERSON> Kreicher </PERSON> explained. He noted that the `` Yankee'' market has grown from $ 3.7 billion in 1985 to a projected $ 6.8 billion this year. What makes the <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> issue noteworthy is the size of the company as well as the magnitude of the sale. The Japanese utility can be considered the biggest company in the world, with a stock market value of around $ 300 billion. That's equivalent to the combined market values of these giants: <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- both rated triple-A -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, according to the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> sale was `` a museum-piece issue,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a senior partner in the <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, the lead underwriter of the issue. `` It's such a strong entity ... It's hard to extricate it from the Japanese economy.'' The giant utility had been part of the Japanese government until April 1985, when the government sold 25 percent of its shares to the public. Other state-owned Japanese companies that are on the drawing boards to be privatized in the near future _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ also are strong candidates for bond issues in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market.

 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the target of a pair of unsolicited takeover bids, said Friday its board has authorized management to evaluate the possibility of selling all or parts of the company and other options. The publishing and information services concern said the board gave those instructions as it voted to oppose a tender offer from a group led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> that values the company at $ 1.9 billion. The board called the bid inadequate. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said its board authorized management to explore a variety of alternatives, including another version of its proposed restructuring that has been tied up in court, a merger or the sale of all or parts of the company. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said it had discussed with unidentified third parties `` their interest in a possible acquisition of all or part of the company'' but that no negotiations occurred. The company said it had provided confidential information to one third party and might provide information to others, and said it could engage in negotiations in the future. But at the same time, the company said the board reaffirmed its intention for a vigorous appeal of a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decision that blocked implementation of its restructuring plan. The company said the appeal would be heard Aug. 15. The announcement of the board's rejection of the $ 75-a-share tender offer launched last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> came as no surprise. British entrepreneur <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> already indicated he was prepared to offer $ 80 a share under certain conditions for all of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s 25.9 million shares, or about $ 2.06 billion. On Wall Street, traders anticipated that the bidding for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> might go higher. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> rose 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 84.62 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, a media analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he thought <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s top priority was to pursue its restructuring. If the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow the company to proceed with the current restructuring plan, <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said the company might then have to seek outside help to sweeten its restructuring plan or find a friendly buyer. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, who follows the publishing business for <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the board appeared to have told management to `` come up with a reasonable alternative.'' `` This forces <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> management to respond to legitimate offers,'' he said. <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> said management might well find `` the course of least resistance would be to find suitable buyer for the whole company.'' <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> repeated his estimate that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> might be worth about $ 85 a share, while <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> said it could be worth about $ 90 a share. In its statement, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said its board rejected the latest <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> offer at a meeting on Thursday, and would recommend to <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shareholders that they not tender their shares under terms of that offer. A call was placed to the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but its spokesman was said to be unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said its board was notified about <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s proposal, but `` determined to review that proposal in due course in light of the company's other alternatives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 9.1 percent stake in <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION>, proposed in mid-May to pay $ 64 a share for the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock it did not already own. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> subsequently proposed a restructuring that would pay shareholders a special dividend and split the company into two separate entities, a publishing company and an information services concern. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> challenged the restructuring plan in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which blocked <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> from putting it into effect. Bass also sweetened its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>, first to $ 73 a share and then to $ 75 a share and launched a tender offer at the higher price on July 18. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s proposal contained several conditions, including <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s dropping the restructuring plan. <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> heads, is the largest printer in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, owns the <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION> there and publishes scientific journals. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> has said he wants to make his company one of the world's largest communications concerns and has spent $ 1 billion making smaller acquisitions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the past year He failed in a bid last year to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Florida-based publishing, insurance and theme park concern.

 The federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they are examining an apparently bogus claim of a large investment in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that triggered a sharp rise in the price of the company's stock. Securities experts said the filing by an unknown <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> man from a fictitious <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> address of a 6.1 percent stock acquisition in the soft drink bottler and movie theater operator raises questions about <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> guidelines. `` It's very disconcerting,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities lawyer. `` The system is designed to provide for very speedy dissemination, which is highly desirable to let the public know when someone takes a position. But the incident certainly shows that can be taken advantage of by someone.'' General Cinema, based in <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, received a brown manila envelope with no return address and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> postmark late Thursday morning. Inside was a copy of a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> from a <PERSON> Kile </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnasen </PERSON> of 15 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and a copy of a partial 13-D form, required whenever an investor holds more than 5 percent of a stock. The man said he used `` personal funds'' to acquire 2.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> worth about $ 61 million. But <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> directory information showed no one named <PERSON> Johnasen </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police told the company there is no Apple Street in the city, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Farwell </PERSON> said. `` We thought it was hoax when it arrived here,'' he said. `` The copy that was made, the fact that it was n't a completed 13-D, made us feel it was a hoax.'' But shortly after 2 p.m. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> carried the report of the filing with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on its financial wires. Before the company could react, the stock, which opened at $ 20.87 -LCB- a share, rose to a high of $ 23.25 before closing at $ 21.75. The stock was unchanged Friday. `` It's a serious matter,'' <PERSON> Farwell </PERSON> said. `` People are making investment decisions. You want them made on accurate information.'' SEC filings are not reviewed before being made public. Balancing the need to ensure the authenticity of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 annual filings with the public's right to quickly learn about major stock acquisitions is difficult, securities experts said. `` When a messenger walks in with a filing, how do you know the messenger did n't print it up in his basement?'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator now working as a white-collar crime and securities lawyer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Filings occur all the time,'' he said. `` How do you check each one? It's a very difficult process.'' <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON> said false filings are `` not uncommon,'' but typically involve misrepresentation of facts and not outright fiction. Form 13-D filings sometimes are the first sign of a takeover bid and can influence stock trading heavily. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said the commission was examining the General Cinema filing. `` If a filing comes in to the commission it's received by a clerk through the mail,'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said. `` Clerks are not really securities analysts. The commission holds all respondents responsible for the accuracy.'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> had asked the exchange to review the incident `` and we'll certainly cooperate. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the securities lawyer, called on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to review its guidelines and impose safeguards. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the securities bar should think hard about how safeguards could be implemented without impeding the speed and efficiency of the system,'' he said. `` In retrospect we're fortunate this has n't happened more often.

 The dollar rose broadly against major currencies Friday in anticipation of higher interest rates and continued strong economic growth and despite central bank intervention. Gold prices also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at a bid of $ 436 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 432.75 late Thursday. Analysts said the dollar reached its highs for the week against some currencies, after falling in early trading as central banks intervened to suppress its rise. `` For awhile it was working. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and other central banks stepped away for some reason and the dollar bounced right back up,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Dealers here and in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said repeated dollar sales by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> could not contain the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's strength Dollar buying has persisted in recent days on the assumption that interest rates are heading higher and that economic growth is continuing strong, analysts said. Interest rates in the financial markets rose earlier this week on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was moving to tighten credit to stem a rise in inflation. Higher interest rates increase the value of dollar-denominated investments. The dollar was bolstered because `` all the signs point to a higher interest rate environment'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefamovicz </PERSON>, a corporate advisor at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 132.53 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.05 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 133.145 yen from 132.55 yen late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.7105, down from $ 1.7225 Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.7090 from late Thursday's $ 1.7215. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Thursday, included: 1.87985 West German marks, up from 1.86615; 1.56325 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.3355 French francs, up from 6.2875; 1,384.50 Italian lire, up from 1,377.75; and 1.21055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.20785.

 The stock market climbed sharply Friday in a robust rally that surprised traders and lured institutional investors from the sidelines. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed at 2,128.73, up 46.40 points in its largest one-day advance since June 8, when the index rose 48.36. The Dow average's gain on the week totaled 67.74 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 15 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,178 issues up, 329 down and 470 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 192.34 million shares, up from 154.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 217.91 million shares. The market's advance steadily gained momentum and breadth throughout the session, peppered with computer-triggered buying activity. The Dow average's push above the 2,100 level at midday helped lure money from the institutional investors who had been reluctant to participate. The rally `` took most traders by surprise,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, noting that many had expected `` it would be a typical summer day.'' Pointing to volume higher than the anemic levels seen earlier in the week as well as broad overall increases in stock prices, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the rally was `` healthier than -LRB- those -RRB- we've seen recently.'' The Dow average climbed more than 28 points in the previous session, but the advance mostly was confined to blue chip and technology issues. `` This was encouraging market behavior -LRB- that -RRB- suggests we could break out of the malaise,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. Analysts attributed the advance to fresh strength in the dollar and continued favorable reaction to comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who indicated Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has n't changed credit policy recently The comments served to `` quiet some fears that have been reflected in bond prices,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. With the spotlight off interest rates, investors were able to turn attention to the positive corporate earnings reports pouring in over the past few weeks. Investors had been reluctant to react to the favorable reports for fear that higher interest rates would dilute corporate profits down the road. Analysts were optimistic that the market could build on gains in the coming week. `` I love to see a rally on a Friday in the summer, because a lot of people are n't here to participate, and hopefully the decision makers will come back Monday and further the rally,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 125 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which said it would realign certain departments in its domestic oil and gas subsidiary, rose 2 to 48 -LCB-. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> was up ~ at 84 | The publisher said it was exploring options after rejecting a $ 75-a-share bid from the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Union Carbide, which withdrew a planned offering of 15 million common shares, rose 1 ~ to 23 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> gained ~ at 45 | amid rumors the company may sell its household products division for as much as $ 2 billion Public Service of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, down -LRB- at 14 ~, was the most active issue with nearly 23 million shares changing hands as traders moved to capture the utility's quarterly dividend As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 47.7 billion, or 1.80 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index climbed 2.95 to 153.35. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials gained 6.68 to 313.98, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 6.00 at 272.02.

<HEAD>Tokyo's Rollercoaster Stock Market Spooks U.S. Traders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock dealers have been faced for some time with an emotional dilemma over the Japanese equities market _ envy and fear. Riding <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s post-war economic boom, the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market soared both before and after October's bloody stock market collapse. While traders here might be green with envy over that market's stellar performance, many maintain that a crack is inevitable. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market's recent volatility has only served to heighten concerns that trace back more than a year. `` It's like dealing with <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There's a great amount of paranoia. We know it's going to crack, we just do n't know when.'' During the week ended July 22, the key Nikkei 225-share index suffered its biggest single-day drop ever and a net loss of 590 points for the week. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market recouped in the past week, with the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index gaining a net 610 points despite signals that Japanese economic growth might be flagging. The Japanese government reported that its index of leading indicators measured 40 in May, the first time in 17 months the index sank below 50, which is considered the base number indicating an expanding economy. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, editor and publisher of the Professional Tape Reader newsletter in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, sees fissures in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s stock market irrespective of what's going on the economy Among those problems are a technical weakening of certain issues and the psychological inability among investors to acknowlege any downside potential, both of which could spark a `` serious'' downward move within the next 18 months, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. The Nikkei index plowed beyond its pre-crash high even after shell-shocked foreigners sold some $ 21 billion in Japanese securities in October and November last year. Although the broader Japanese market has not advanced as impressively as the Nikkei, `` nobody can concede it will go down,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. `` Some are talking about 35,000'' in the Nikkei index, which closed the week at the 27,900 level, he said. Indeed, <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karino </PERSON>, general manager of foreign stock trading at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market `` is going into a golden age _ it's going to be the ` nifty'90s,''' he said, predicting further advances for at least three or four more years Here at home, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had traded as high as 2,722 last August, finished the week up 67.74 at 2,128.73. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index gained 3.80 to 153.35; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 0.02 to 387.33, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index edged up 0.07 to 306.18. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 163.98 million shares a day, against 150.13 million the week before. <PERSON> Karino </PERSON> explained that Japanese fund managers, who are faced with low interest rates at home, have little choice but to invest in equities. Wall Street, he says in contrast, `` is in a recession because most investors would like to keep their money in cash.'' American traders complain bitterly that the Japanese market is `` rigged,'' since large corporations typically own big stakes in each other that they do not sell. In addition, they say that Japanese government involvement in the market would preclude any sharp downward spike. `` They have a vested interest in trying to kite the market higher,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. `` But there always comes a point where enough is enough, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is reaching that point.'' Some have criticized the Japanese market as being driven by rumors, while traders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more apt to take a formalized, technical approach stocks, buying and selling based on company performances and fundamental economic data. `` Perhaps we're a little wiser,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. `` We've seen 1929 and know what happens after that.'' In the short term, however, a selloff in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can be positive for domestic markets. Japanese investors who dump stocks in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> are likely to put that money into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks and bonds. American traders probably are overreacting when they point to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the epicenter of the next international economic cataclysm. `` But on the other side, the Japanese are just so complacent about their market _ they think it can continue to go up, so it's like these two investor classes are living in two totally different worlds,'' one analyst said Experts say the Japanese market is characterized by two extremes _ foreigners who fear they are about to fall through a trap door, and Japanese who think it can go on forever.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Soar Their Limits; Commodities Advance
Broadly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and sobyean futures scored their first major advance in more than two weeks Friday and many other commodity markets followed suit, reversing a trend of generally falling prices. But a surprising government report showing the nation's cattle herd to be larger than many experts had predicted was expected to bring a sharp drop in cattle futures prices next week. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed Friday ahead of that report. On other exchanges, sugar, coffee and precious metals futures all rebounded; stock-interest futures advanced sharply; and most energy futures gained. A basketful of bullish factors sparked a buying binge in grain and soybean pits of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mr. Excitement jumped in here today,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst with G.H. <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Most corn and soybean futures soared their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel while the limitless August soybean contract gained more than 34 cents. An overnight increase in cash corn prices spurred some hedge-type buying of corn futures by commerical grain dealers and processors, analysts said. A rumor later in the day that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for corn prompted further buying of corn futures. The depressed soybean market attracted bargain hunters early in the session. Then meatpacker <ORGANIZATION> Conagra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> released a prediction that this year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean production would total 1.56 billion bushels, compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest estimate of 1.65 billion bushels, which added further support to the soybean market, <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. Wheat prices advanced on news of new export sales and on the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to reduce from the current 10 percent the portion of their acreage that wheat growers must set aside to qualify for federal price supports. `` There had been a lot of talk of it going down to 5 percent, so that got the wheat market off to a good start,'' <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON> said. Private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain this weekend in the drought-stricken Farm Belt lent strength across the board, analysts said. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued several forecasts predicting warm and dry conditions in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next weekend, a mixed precipitation picture in the Farm Belt during August and above-normal rainfall in the region in September and October. Wheat settled 10 cents to 18 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.68 \ a bushel; corn was 6 \ cents to 10 cents higher with September at $ 2.75 a bushel; oats were 7 cents to the limit 15 cents higher with September at $ 2.71 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 34 -LCB- cents higher with August at $ 7.76 a Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s semi-annual cattle inventory report, which was widely expected to show about a 2 percent reduction from a year ago in the nation's cattle herd. But the report showed the cattle herd to be down only 1 percent, at 107.9 million head, basically because of a 1988 calf crop that was larger than expected. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said the estimated calf crop of 40.2 million head indicated the bovine birth rate during the first half of the year was the third-highest in the past 17 years. `` That's where the biggest part of the surprise came in,'' he said. Prices of cattle for delivery next year have generally been rising on the assumption that this year's drought will cut into next year's cattle supply. But analysts predicted prices of 1989 cattle futures would plunge on Monday because of the large calf number. Live cattle were .15 cent to .55 cent higher with August at 66.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 79.45 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent lower to .60 cent higher with August at 43.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .43 cent lower to .65 cent higher with August at 30.52 cents a pound. Sugar and coffee futures rebounded from three days of sharp declines in mostly technical buying on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. September coffee settled .93 cent higher at $ 1.2472 a pound; October sugar was .72 cent higher at 11.54 cents a pound. The inflationary implications of rising commodity prices, combined with a drop in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond interest rates gave precious metals futures a boost on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Gold settled $ 3.50 to $ 4.10 higher with August at $ 436.10 a troy ounce; silver was 9.5 cents to 10.2 cents higher with September at $ 6.855 a troy ounce. The decline in interest rates also helped trigger a sharp rise in stock-index futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 6.40 points higher at 273.25. Energy futures prices made slight gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in light trading dominated mostly by technical factors. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 16 cents to 21 cents higher with September at $ 16.31 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent to .40 cent higher with August at 44.66 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .21 cent lower to .87 cent higher with August at 51.74 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has bought an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The sales, equal to about 14.7 million bushels, were handled by two companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 tons. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the sales were part of an authorzed 2 million tons of wheat announced April 5 under the Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, and some left over from an earlier authorization Although no selling prices or other details were announced, recent wheat prices at farm points have averaged around $ 3.46 per bushel, indicating a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm value of about $ 50 million. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices rose Friday, bolstered by the dollar's resilient rise against other major currencies. The gains were greatest in longer-term issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond rose about -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, dropped to 9.21 percent from 9.26 percent late Thursday. Analysts said bond prices got a lift from the advancing dollar, which defied the efforts of some central banks to drive the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower by selling dollars in the open market. The dollar rose to 133.14 Japanese yen in late trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 132.55 yen late Thursday. `` I think you had to be impressed,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, president of Capital Insight, an investment firm in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` This was a very good day for the bond market.'' A falling dollar, on the other hand, tends to erode the value of dollar-denominated investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds. Bond values also drew support, analysts said, from indications by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> that the central bank was not changing its credit policy. `` Reserve data shows the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not really tightened -LRB- credit -RRB- and that was confirmed by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Won </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Norwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a bank holding company in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman testified before a congressional committee Thursday. Tighter monetary policy tends to push interest rates up, driving bond prices lower. Earlier this week, bond prices fell as interest rates rose amid speculation the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was tightening credit to restrain rising inflation, which devalues fixed-income securities such as bonds and notes. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues gained 1-16 point to -LRB- point, intermediate maturities rose 5-32 point to 9-32 point, and 20-year issues advanced about -RRB- point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.08 to 1,136.72. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged up 0.34 to 282.17. Three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, declined 3 basis points to a discounted rate of 6.94 percent and a yield of 7.15 percent. Six-month bills slipped 1 basis point to a discounted rate of 7.12 percent and a yield of 7.48 percent, while one-year bills fell 6 basis points to 7.33 percent to yield 7.86 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discounted rate is the interest rate the market uses to price bills. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 7 13-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds, Dollar, Farm Prices All Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Stocks and bonds strengthened sharply Friday in rallies stemming partly from the dollar's appreciation against foreign currencies, counteracting fear of higher inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 46.40 points to 2,128.73, the largest one-day advance since a 48.36-point gain June 8. Broader market barometers also rose strongly. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue rose more than $ 3 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 9.21 percent from 9.26 percent late Thursday. Market economists attributed part of the advances to a jump in the dollar's value in foreign exchange trading, which increases overseas demand for securities denominated in dollars and lessens the prospect of sharply higher domestic inflation, a constant source of concern to investors. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency gained more than a West German pfennig to 1.87985 marks and nearly a half Japanese yen to 133.145 yen. The gains came despite central-bank dollar selling to slow its appreciating value. In other economic news Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the prices farmers received for raw products this month rose 3.6 percent from June, reflecting the drought's devastating effect on crop and livestock production. The department's said higher prices for corn, soybeans and eggs contributed most to the July increase. Lower prices for oranges, cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities. Department projections earlier this month showed 1988 grain production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year. Heat and drought have dried pastures and forced producers to thin herds to cut down on rising feed costs.

 Television is teaching Britons to love the once little-known sport of football, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sporting goods companies are cashing in on a craze for everything from uniforms to T-shirts, badges and fluffy toys bearing <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> team logos. `` The market here is a six-year-old market,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maconie </PERSON>, whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, handles licensing, publishing and marketing for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` It was created with television.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Channel 4 television began broadcasting weekly highlights of <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> games in 1982, calling the program `` American Football'' to distinguish it from soccer, called simply `` football'' here. Audiences have tripled to around 3 million viewers each week, the TV station's studies say. Many British fans have gone beyond armchair-quarterbacking. More than 100 teams have sprung up in the country, a league has been formed sponsored by Budweiser beer, and several magazines dedicated to the imported sport are being published. As the game has caught on, sales of American football paraphernalia have taken off. Last year, <PERSON> Maconie </PERSON> sold more than $ 43 million worth of NFL-licensed products, a 15 percent increase over the previous year. He expects a similar climb this year. `` We started with zero in 1982, so we've obviously had some very dramatic growth,'' said <PERSON> Maconie </PERSON>, who worked to put football on TV here. The growth has attracted some of the top names in American sporting goods to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. They have been helped by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which staged an `` American Football Equipment Exhibition'' to coincide with a pre-season <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> game Sunday at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Wembley Stadium between the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolphins </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers, dubbed `` The American Bowl.'' The British market for football items `` is here to stay, there's no question about that,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which distributes products made by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rawlings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> Standing at his booth decorated with samples of team shirts, footballs and shoulderpads, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said sales of playing equipment have leveled off as the sport has become more established. But, he said, sales of souvenir-type items, especially to youngsters, `` is a side of the business which has been very big.'' `` They, having seen their fathers and big brothers play, now want to play themselves. That market can develop well,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bye </PERSON>, an official with the <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION>, a team in the Budweiser league, was hoping to find a good deal on helmets at the trade fair. `` Each player takes 300 pounds -LRB- about $ 500 -RRB- or more to kit each year,'' he said. `` You have a squad of 50 players, that's a lot of money.'' Bye added that he was hoping to find higher quality goods for his team. `` I believe that the existing stuff marketed to the general public in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> at the moment is n't of high enough quality,'' Bye said. `` The stuff in the States is very good. We could sell some of that over here.'' Teddy Craze, whose Fast Lane Sports distributes for Champion Products of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, says his sales of uniforms and various NFL-licensed items have gone up by 300 percent in one year. `` There's really a good hard core'' of fans hungry for American-made football goods, he said, `` and this is really developing very strongly.'' Another British firm, <ORGANIZATION> Woolgrove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imports </ORGANIZATION>, recently began distributing products made by <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, Ill. Product manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, his sales booth crammed with <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> footballs and other football paraphernalia, agreed that the televised <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> highlights created a market that did not exist before. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> pre-season contests staged at <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> the past three summers also have sparked a lot of interest _ and sales. `` I think it's probably the best marketing system we have, in fact, to have the top teams coming over here and showing how the game is properly played,'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said. `` And it's a big spinoff in the market.''

<HEAD>Boeing Announces Aircraft Orders Estimated At Up To $790 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it had received orders for 12 commercial jets, with a total value estimated at up to $ 790 million, from a Canadian and an Australian airline. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that an Australian leasing group, <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, had converted options on six <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> powered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 aircraft into firm orders. But <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> aerospace company had not been able to confirm that deal yet with <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION> order goes through, it would give <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> its fourth straight record year in dollar value for commercial jet orders. <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION> had taken the options in October when it placed a firm order for six 757s. Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday ordered three 747-400s and took options for three more, while <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ordered nine 737-400s with options for five more. Neither airline announced the values of their orders. But <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said a 747-400 sells for $ 115 million to $ 130 million, and the smaller 737-400 for $ 29 million to $ 33 million. The orders also include provisions for training and spare parts, which <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said usually boost the cost by 15 percent. At those prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' order would be worth between $ 396.8 million and $ 448.5 million, and Australian's order would be for $ 300.2 million to $ 341.6 million. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had orders for 438 jet aircraft worth about $ 19.75 billion. That compares with last year's 366 jets worth $ 19.9 billion, a record for dollar value. The record for number of jets ordered is 461 in 1978. <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is to receive its new jets from late 1990 through March 1991. It said in a news release that it will use the new jets on <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> routes, such as Toronto-Tokyo and <LOCATION> Vancouver-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The 747-400, which made its first flight last spring and is to be delivered to its initial customer before the end of the year, can carry up to 660 passengers, but will normally carry up to 412 to achieve an 8,200-mile range. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has had 149 orders for 747-400s, and 873 orders for all versions of 747s. The 737-400, a stretch version of the twinjet, will seat 139 in Australian's configuration and have a range of about 2,500 miles. The airline is to receive the planes in 1990 and 1991. Australian Chairman A.E. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said it plans to use the planes to start replacing its <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200 aircraft, which it began operating in 1970. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has 125 orders for 737-400s. There have been more than 2,150 orders for all 737 models.

 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its second-quarter earnings fell 54.1 percent despite a 73 percent revenue rise. Prime said it earned $ 7.2 million, or 15 cents a share, in the three months ended July 4 compared with a profit of $ 15.7 million, or 32 cents a share, a year ago. The company reported revenues of $ 408.4 million for the quarter, up from $ 236 million a year earlier. The latest results include a onetime charge of $ 5.1 million after taxes for the previously-disclosed withdrawal of its mini-supercomputer from the market. The 1987 figures do not include results of <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which merged with Prime in February. On Monday, Prime pulled its MXCL5 mini-supercomputer from the marketplace, citing competitive pricing and a slumping market for the action. In a statement, Prime President <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said the company met its earnings and revenue expectations despite the charge on the MXCL5. `` We're pleased that in the midst of a difficult industry environment and our integration with <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION>, we were able to meet our revenue and expense goals for the quarter,'' <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said. For the first six months of the year, Prime said it earned $ 21.7 million, or 45 cents a share, down from $ 27.6 million, or 56 cents a share, a year ago. Six-month revenue rose to $ 772 million from $ 458 million in 1987.
