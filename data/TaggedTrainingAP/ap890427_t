 The federal inspector who oversees <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 fleet testified Thursday he had not been aware the airline had a problem with a cargo door that later blew off in flight, killing nine passengers. Inspector <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Batiza </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had failed to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> complied with a federal rule that took effect last July 1, requiring airlines to inspect cargo doors after they were manually operated because of electrical problems. Testimony on the final day of a three-day hearing into the accident held by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also centered on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s design for the door. But the hearing failed to unearth any definite cause for the accident. On Wednesday, the airline testified that it was unaware of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspection rule and was not in compliance for about nine months. But by coincidence, company mechanics made a partial inspection of the ill-fated cargo door in late December, two months before the Feb. 24 disaster, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> executive said Thursday. The inspection followed repairs made to the door, which had failed to open and close electrically. `` I am convinced the check ... verified that the door was working,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> vice president for technical services. He added, however, that the inspection was not as thorough as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> required under the new rule. <PERSON> Batiza </PERSON> testified that he was unaware of the repairs at the time and had not found any deficiencies in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance program recently. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramakis </PERSON>, manager of aircraft maintenance for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, testified later that agency inspectors were required to review rule changes with airlines to see if airline plans for responding to the changes were adequate. <PERSON> Ramakis </PERSON> declined to comment when asked to explain how <PERSON> Batiza </PERSON>, who oversees <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 31-plane 747 fleet, could not know that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was failing to follow the new rule. Another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspector, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, said Thursday he was unaware that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was using power tools to operate some cargo doors, despite recommendations from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> not to do so for fear of damaging the mechanisms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who oversees maintenance for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s entire 412-plane fleet, said he was unaware until just a few weeks ago that the company had received <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> approval to use the power tools. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing was being held to gather evidence on why the door and part of the fuselage tore off <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 as the 747 was climbing to 23,000 feet. Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> as the plane headed for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door, which remains on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to retrieve it. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was sharply criticized by an accident investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for insisting 747 cargo doors are safe despite two incidents since 1987 of the doors opening in mid-flight. A door on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> partially opened in 1987 and the plane had to return to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with no loss of life. No definite cause has ever been established for that incident. `` We can not explain the Pan American incident, and we have the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> accident where the door failed, but we steadfastly are saying the door is safe,'' Capt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> complained. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineering manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> spent two hours in the witness chair defending the design and operation of the cargo door, which has been the main focus of the investigation. `` I do n't know how the door came open,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` I do n't want to speculate on how it happened.'' Under questioning, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had not done projections on the effect of cargo-door openings in mid-flight. `` You had no idea what would happen ... when the door came off the airplane?'' an incredulous <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> asked. `` The doors are not designed to come off the airplane,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> replied. `` We had no way of knowing exactly what would happen if a door came open in flight.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> builds 747s in nearby <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retail pharmacy chain, was arrested Thursday on charges of paying a $ 33,000 bribe to a state <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member, authorities said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON> allegedly was videotaped saying the money was intended to induce the board member to quit so a replacement of Rite Aid's choosing could be appointed by the administration of Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, prosecutors said. Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said Grass also promised the pharmacy board member family medical insurance for four years if the member signed an undated resignation letter. Rite Aid, in a statement, said the arrest stemmed from a vendetta by the pharmacy board against Rite Aid and said the payment by check reflected money legally owed by the chain to the board member. A spokesman for the governor denied <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> intended to appoint a pharmacy board member who would be supportive of Rite Aid, which is based in <LOCATION> Shiremanstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The prosecutor's office did not identify the target of the alleged bribe attempt but Rite Aid said Grass met with board member <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilczynski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, who declined to comment on the allegations. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said Grass brought six drafts of an undated resignation letter, one of which the board member signed, and suggested that the board member retire between June and October. `` ` We'll let you know,''' <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> quoted Grass as telling the board member with regard to the effective date of the resignation. The pharmacy board is made up of eight voting members appointed to staggered four-year terms by the governor subject to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. The executive director only votes to break ties. Grass was charged with bribery and was freed after posting 10 percent of his $ 100,000 surety bond. His attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, declined comment. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> South </PERSON>, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>'s communications director, said the governor knew nothing about the matter. `` He -LRB- the governor -RRB- has never heard of the guy -LRB- Grass -RRB-,'' South said. `` He is either using the governor for cover or using too many drugs from his own drug store.'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, assistant vice president for corporate communications for Rite Aid, said the charge was `` totally without merit and the payment in question was made in satisfaction of a contract between a pharmacist, who also is an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> pharmacy board member, and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugstores </ORGANIZATION>, his former employer.'' She said Rite Aid acquired the <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugstores </ORGANIZATION> on April 10 and was liable for the payment under the contract. The payment was made in settlement of the contract and was legal, she said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> basketball coach <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Thursday that he met with an alleged drug kingpin and asked him to steer clear of his players after learning that several members of his team were frequenting a bar where drug trafficking is common. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told ABC News that he summoned the alleged drug dealer, 24-year-old <PERSON> Rayful </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, after learning that many players on the <ORGANIZATION> Hoyas </ORGANIZATION> team were socializing at Chapter III, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> nightclub where both college students and alleged drug dealers regularly gather. `` I sent the word out on the street that I'd like to talk to him,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` It was almost like a tacit agreement: ` Do me a favor: If you see anything going on out there, use whatever resources you have to stop it from happening.''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who coached the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> basketball team in the 1988 Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, said he met with <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> in February. On April 15, <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> and 15 others were arrested and charged with running a massive transcontinental cocaine ring. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> has estimated that <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>'s group may be responsible for up to 20 percent of the cocaine trafficking in the nation's capital. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he was trying to head off a problem before it developed. `` What I was trying to do ... was not wait until something happened, that would hurt one of the kids,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- I did n't want -RRB- to have a body laying there, someone who had been using drugs.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> did not elaborate on whether he suspected any of his athletes were using drugs. `` Nightline'' host <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> reported that <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> learned that freshman center Alonzo Mourning and sophomore forward <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> were among the <ORGANIZATION> Hoyas </ORGANIZATION> who frequented the nightclub. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> described <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> as `` very polite.'' `` It was ` Yes sir, no sir,''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said.

 A spring snowstorm swept across the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, dumping up to 8 inches of heavy, wet snow in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, while winds and new snow created near blizzard conditions in parts of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and tornadoes hit southern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. A twister struck the Bluffs Run greyhound racetrack in <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs </ORGANIZATION> about 8 p.m. Thursday, sending one man to the hospital for stitches after he was struck by flying debris, officials said. The tornado, which touched down in a field about 1,000 yards from the track, ripped siding from the building, downed trees and damaged some cars with wind-blown debris, officials said. The dog races were delayed about 15 minutes. Another tornado was reported on the ground in southern <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, about 7:40 p.m. and funnel clouds were sighted over the central part of the city as well as near <LOCATION> Papillion </LOCATION> and 20 miles west of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, the weather service said.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court, spurning charges of reverse discrimination, affirmed an agreement Thursday that calls for the government to promote 240 black civilian workers at <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a consent degree issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> that also required the government to pay $ 3.75 million in back pay to 3,200 black civilians who were employed at the base between 1972 and 1979. The agreement, reached in 1984 on a lawsuit filed in 1975, was one of the largest discrimination settlements in <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> history. The three-judge appeals panel agreed with <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> that black civilian workers were entitled to the promotions because of past discrimination at the base near <LOCATION> Warner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robins </LOCATION>, about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The appeals court earlier had ordered <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> to allow a group of white and non-minority employees, called the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, to intervene in the lawsuit and challenge the promotions. That group had challenged <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' decision in October 1987 to reaffirm the 1984 decree. The court ruled on an appeal by the fund, upholding the consent decree and saying the interveners had failed to present any evidence that the decree would have hurt their own chances for promotion. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poss </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the group would discuss the ruling before deciding whether to appeal future. But, he added, `` We thought from the beginning it would be a case that would have to be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' Thursday's opinion, written by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, noted that 169 promotions were granted to blacks under the decree between December 1984 and October 1986 and that those promotions `` comprised only 4.3 percent of the promotions made at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> during that period of time.'' The court noted that the decree was narrowly written so the promotions were made only to 38 target positions to which the original black plaintiffs had `` demonstrated that black employees were promoted in proportions less than their representation in the work force or in lower grades.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote that the white and non-minority employees `` did not present any evidence that any one of them otherwise eligible for a target position was denied that position.'' <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkman </PERSON> said Thursday night that base officials had not had time to study the court's ruling so it was `` premature for me to make any statement on it.

<TEXT>
 As he was finishing an emergency appendectomy, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> noticed what he throught was a stray thread on the surgical drapes. Then it wiggled. The thread was actually a 2-inch-long skinny red worm slithering out of the patient's incision. It was a fish worm, inadvertently eaten by the patient in sushi the night before. The patient was undergoing the operation for abdominal pain, but doctors believe the worm was the real cause of his misery. The incident, described in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, `` is an uncomfortable reminder of the potential danger of eating raw fish,'' noted Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schantz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Raw fish in sushi and sashimi has become popular with the spread of Japanese restaurants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but health experts say most cases of worm infection occur when people prepare raw fish at home. Experienced sushi chefs are good at spotting wormy fish so it does n't reach customers. In the latest case, the victim ate raw fish at a friend's home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` He looked like anybody else with appendicitis,'' recalled <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a surgeon at Booth Memorial Hospital. `` I operated, and much to my chagrin the appendix was normal. I was getting ready to close the abdomen, and I see this little thing, and it looks like it's moving. `` I said, ` Wait a minute. There's something wrong. I'll be damned. It's a worm.''' The astonished doctors sent the worm to <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, where it was identified as a larval nematode known as eustrongylides. `` There is a clear danger involved in eating raw fish. This underscores that danger,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittner </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> parasitologist. The adult form of eustrongylides is a parasite of fish-eating birds, while the larvae are found in the flesh of fish that live in brackish and fresh water. In an editorial in the journal, <PERSON> Schantz </PERSON> noted that only four other cases of human infection with a nematode have been reported. All were fishermen who swallowed bait minnows whole _ `` a practice not likely to be widely imitated.'' The worms most commonly acquired from raw seafood are larvae of the family Anisakidae. Between 25 and 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases have been documented, but experts believe most cases are not recognized or reported to health officials. The worms often pass harmlessly through the digestive system or are coughed up a few hours after the meal. Doctors have even described a condition known as `` tingling throat syndrome,'' which occurs when the worms get stuck in the back of the throat. Sometimes, however, the worms burrow into the wall of the stomach or the intestines. They must be removed with a tube that's pushed down the victim's throat <PERSON> Schantz </PERSON> noted that many commercial fish are commonly infected with worms. These include mackerel, herring, rockfish, salmon and cod. The parasites also are more common in fish from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> than from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The number of worm infections is increasing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Schantz </PERSON> doubts that this will ever become a major health problem, since most Americans still prefer their fish cooked, which kills the worms.

 A small slot in the personals section was not enough for <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, a lovelorn businessman who took a full page in a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> newspaper to seek out his dream woman _ to the tune of $ 3,744. `` I am looking for a very special woman who would like to share adventures and a taste of the high life with me on an occasional basis,'' said the advertisement placed Wednesday in the La Suisse daily by <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, who identified himself only by his first name. A spokesman for the newspaper said it was the most expensive personal it had ever printed. The 39-year-old <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> businessman, who said he was recovering from a broken relationship, told The Associated Press the advertisement was no joke. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> said the successful applicant would find him a `` generous and creative'' person offering presents of jewels, flowers, clothes and exotic holidays.

 <PERSON> Gamma </PERSON> <PERSON> Boo </PERSON>, a little-known star in the constellation Bootes, has been thrust from obscurity and named the `` astrophysical symbol'' of the French Revolution bicentennial. Hundreds of people toasted the new twinkling symbol with champagne at the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at sunset Wednesday and peered into the gathering twilight to the northeast trying to make it out. <PERSON> Jean-Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanneney </PERSON>, head of the commission planning the festivities marking the revolution's 200th birthday, said choosing an official star showed the poetic side of the celebration. <PERSON> Gamma </PERSON> <PERSON> Boo </PERSON>, also known as Seginus, was chosen because it is the brightest of several stars that are roughly 200 light-years from earth. Light now reaching <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> would have left the star at about the time Parisians were storming the Bastille prison in July 1789. To spot <PERSON> Gamma </PERSON> <PERSON> Boo </PERSON>, a skywatcher should locate the Big Dipper, then follow the direction of the Dipper's handle another handle-length away.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mass media adviser for the 1988 presidential race denied Wednesday that his campaign strategy and tactics were dirty or too negative. `` Look at ` trash TV,' look at the lines blurring between tabloid journalism and journalism, look at the garbage that is out there in general,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, a panelist at a seminar on `` The Presidency in the'90s'' at <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would submit that the political campaigns are among the cleanest things on television today,'' <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> said. NBC News commentator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON>, who moderated the seminar, said that since presidential candidates are spending public money _ about $ 41 million each in 1988 _ `` we ought to have some say in how they spend it.'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, political and media adviser for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, defended political advertising as admittedly `` a short and clumsy way to get to know a candidate. Yet even within those limits, you pick up something.'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, an expert on presidential politics from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, suggested a nonpartisan panel be instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness and accuracy. And while some may complain that the presidential campaign drags on, `` I do n't know what you can do about the process being too long short of legislating it and that would just drive it underground like booze,'' he said. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that allowing the political parties a bigger role in selecting candidates might produce more leaders on a par with the great presidents of years past. `` There are people who believe when it comes to selecting candidates for president, that you use participatory democracy to its fullest extent in a general election, but that there are other ways that parties ought to select candidates,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Certainly no changes are going to be made by 1992, but it certainly isnce because there are `` too many imponderables'' in making a successful campaign. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that negative campaigning was one of the factors that turn people off and keep them away from the polls on Election Day. <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said he believed the role of television was `` vastly exaggerated.'' Even with the skills of media gurus like <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, `` you run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent unemployment and you have a very different result,'' he predicted. <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, a former speech writer for Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, also criticized the level of public discourse the campaigns have reached. `` Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the debate,'' he said, `` whether it's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his ` working poor' litany or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech -LRB- at the Republican convention -RRB-, you can feel the public almost come alive, say, ` More, please give us more.''' At a later seminar Wednesday night, pollster <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he believed that presidents should turn to public opinion polls after they confront the issues and make a decision. But, he pointed out, `` our polling is either victimized or a reflection of what is reported. There's no question about it. And television is the most powerful medium.'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON> said television's coverage of issues is dependent, like it or not, on the president presenting them in a simplified manner `` If they want to communicate what their policies and their thoughts and their decisions are to the American people over television, they simply must learn how to simplify it,'' she said. She also noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been getting his message out as well as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or even as well as he did during the campaign. `` Presidents win support in these times not because the public agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on substantive issues, but because they come to like them over television,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became adored by the public because the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> manipulated very brilliantly'' the media with staged events and photo opportunities, she said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not done that, she said, adding `` I kind of respect it but it's not doing him any good.'' The seminars at <LOCATION> Fordham </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> were part of the city's commemoration of the bicentennial of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s presidential

 She never knew how great she was. Amid the blimp-size egos of the entertainment world, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> stood out like an orange beacon. She never bragged. She never exercised her considerable power. She always seemed astonished, even embarrassed, when honors inevitably came her way. When she was to receive a humanitarian award from Variety Clubs on a CBS special five years ago, she told me: `` There comes a time in your life when you get a lot of plaques. It's very flattering and I'll go along with it, especially if it benefits children.'' Whenever she was praised for `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' she invariably replied: `` Well, all of the credit should go to -LRB- writers -RRB- <PERSON> Madelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'' Or, `` <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> was a genius: He was responsible for the show's success.'' Or she cited co-stars <PERSON> Desi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON>. Yes, the writing and producing and casting of `` I Love Lucy'' were marvelous, but <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s performance added the quantum force. Her inspired pantomime could be written by no one: the growing panic as the chocolate assembly line speeded up; her catalog of pained expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating. Unlike many stars, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> rarely indulged in self-analysis. But on one occasion she revealed why her feelings about the `` I Love Lucy'' triumph might have been ambivalent: Living through the last five years of the show, she said, `` took the edge off any enjoyment I might have had. <PERSON> Desi </PERSON>'s drinking and carousing were a terrible embarrassment, bad for a woman's self-esteem The talk around town was ` poor <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.' Because I could n't face people, I became a recluse for more than 5 -LCB- years. `` I never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio, and actually, working together was a blessing. <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> had everything so well organized that it was easy to do the work.'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was late in reaching her comedy potential. She was 40 when `` I Love Lucy'' started on CBS and revolutionized television. And although she spent many years in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, `` none of the studios ever designed comedies for me the way <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> did for <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> did for <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwyn </PERSON> did for <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>,'' she once said. `` Television was the medium for me, the medium for anyone who wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half for a movie to come out,'' she said in an interview late in life. `` Television is an instant barometer, especially the way we did it. `` It was all new. Nobody knew anything about television. Nobody was there to say, ` No, do n't do that, it's wrong!' We never knew what was wrong and what was right. We were all feeling our way. <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> was very innovative and very showmanship-conscious and was very intent on going ahead and doing it: ` That sounds all right, let's go!' So we went.'' Always the credit to someone else. But millions upon millions of television watchers know otherwise.

 When 200 officers in riot gear came to arrest protest organizer <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> two weeks ago, they stormed over the walls of his home _ actually a museum to his poet-father. And when the heavily armed officers returned to search the premises, they were stymied outside for four hours because <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>'s 9-year-old son refused to open the door when he was home alone. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>, 50, is one of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s most prominent dissidents, who helped organize demonstrations that ended April 9 in a bloody confrontation between troops and protesters. At least 20 people died in the unrest. One of the southern republic's most prominent activists, he is following the example of his late father, <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON>, a revered writer who was involved in creating the independent republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> that existed from 1918 to 1921. After the government confiscated some of his father's earnings six years ago, his son persuaded authorities to use the disputed funds to renovate the family home into a house-museum showcasing <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON>'s life. The leaky roof and old linoleum are gone, according to <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Manana </PERSON> The family now lives in spacious rooms with carved wooden shutters and a sweeping staircase. Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday that her husband is still being held, and she has not been allowed to see him or heard from him since. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> helped start the series of demonstrations that culminated in the April 9 tragedy when he went on a hunger strike March 11, with a list of 20 demands. Many of the demands involved ethnic issues, such as vandalism of an antique church, allegedly by Southern Ossetians, and anti-Georgian discrimination in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a region of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But in seeking a resolution to these disputes, he drew accusations that he was inciting ethnic tensions himself. By the end of March, Abkhazians were holding mass meetings to complain about discrimination against them by Georgians. The <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> demonstrations started as a response to the Abkhazian demands for secession from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and evolved into a mass call for <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. On April 9, protesters helped <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> and other organizers escape the <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> clash because they assumed the leaders were the targets of the soldiers, said Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>. At 6 a.m. that day, <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> was at <ORGANIZATION> Tbilisi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, organizing a general strike, Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said. At 8:30 a.m., about 200 officers of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and police descended on the family home in a neighborhood of antique meandering streets, and scaled the 12-foot-high brick wall rather than ring the bell, Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> said. They had no arrest warrant _ `` nothing at all,'' she said. The officers donned riot gear, burst through a door, attacked her husband and dragged him off to jail, she said. The officers did not damage the shrine of books, photographs and memorabilia of <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>'s father and his involvement in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s heady three years as an independent nation. But in the garden, the officers uprooted the crosses on the graves of <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON>, his wife and daughter. `` Why do they do that to dead people?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> asked. When the police returned April 15 for a search, only to be put off by the 9-year-old, Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. She said she threatened to release to the world press a photograph of the troops swarming over her home if such actions did not halt. On April 20, her home was searched _ by just four officials, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON> says she does not believe new <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON> when he says he wants a dialogue with opponents to replace the traditional party monologue. `` They still do n't want a dialogue,'' she said. If officials really wanted to talk with her husband and other activists, they would release them from prison, she said. She also noted that her husband's 20 demands have never been published in the local press, but <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> ran daily reports last year on an American hunger striker in front of the White House. <PERSON> Gamsakhurdia </PERSON>'s other demands include halting construction of the <ORGANIZATION> Transcaucasian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> and several hydroelectric dams, closure of the polluting oil refinery at <LOCATION> Batumi </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, return of the deported Meskhetian minority from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to their homeland in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and restoration of university-level Georgian studies programs. Authorities have taken action on only one of his 20 demands: conversion of the Metekhi chapel from a concert hall to a place of worship, his wife said.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called on the nation's newspaper publishers to step up their efforts to fight illiteracy. `` We know the job of building a literate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is far from done and newspapers have a crucial role to play,'' the first lady told an audience of about 1,000 gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s 103rd annual convention on Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s talk came on the final day of the three-day meeting, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to direct much attention to the nation's literacy problems during her husband's presidency `` Tens of millions of Americans will never pick up a newspaper,'' and that has obvious implications for the industry, she told the publishers. She said one of the main thrusts of literacy programs should be family literacy, `` where it all begins.'' `` Parents are their children's first role models,'' and illiterate parents are likely to raise children who can not read or write, the first lady said. `` To break this cycle of despair we have to establish literacy as a value in every American family.'' She gave several examples of disadvantaged people across the country, who, with the help of literacy programs, have gotten off welfare and continued their educations. One woman, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was a third-generation welfare mother who learned to read and got off public aid last year with the help of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> literacy program. `` These are the stories of struggle and triumph that newspapers nationwide have used to mobilize'' literacy efforts, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Newspapers also should look within their own ranks in tackling the problem, she said, citing the case of a typesetter at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, publication `` who could not read what she produced.'' The woman is an example of people who learn to cope and mask their reading problems, but still must be helped, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times Publisher <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who spoke after the first lady, cited his newspaper's efforts as an example of what the industry can do to address the problem. The Times has organized a literacy program that includes centers where children and their parents can learn to read, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` No profession is more affected by illiteracy than ours,'' he said. `` The future of newspapers depends on the ability of our citizens to read.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> urged his colleagues to take part `` in an all-out national campaign against illiteracy. Together,'' he said, `` we can make a difference.''

 Beards, an ancient badge of wisdom and virility, are vanishing from the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But a few of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who are still sporting chin whiskers _ and proud of it _ gathered to keep the faith. `` There'll always be beards,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the undaunted chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, whose members convened in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> barber shop Wednesday to count noses and admire each other's facial adornments Only two others showed up _ Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, R-Calif. The two remaining members, Reps. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Flake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, sent their regrets The dwindling ranks of the beard caucus, down to only five members from about a dozen last year, surely make it one of the smallest and least influential special-interest groups on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Indeed, Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, says with a laugh that he recently shaved off his distinctive goatee, which he'd worn for 17 years, `` when I discovered there was no PAC -LRB- political action committee -RRB- that was interested in the beard caucus.'' <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, who also is chief deputy whip for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, says the caucus is a `` fun group'' that meets `` anytime we can get a photographer to come and give us some free publicity.'' Its sole purpose, he says, is to `` allow members to fraternize about the politics of having hair on your face.'' <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> confessed that he shaved off his 10-year-old beard briefly during the Christmas holidays. `` My family had n't seen me for 10 years, so I shaved. They did n't like what they saw, so I grew it back,'' he said. Beards may not be an endangered species, as <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> claims, but they have fallen on hard times. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is full of earnest, clean-shaven yuppies. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has n't seen a beard since <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the liberal Democrat from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, died in 1976. There has n't been a bearded president since <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> left office in 1893. In the turbulent Sixties, beards enjoyed a brief renaissance as symbols of antiwar liberalism, but <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> says they are a `` non-ideological growth'' today. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON> might be right. Although he, <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> are all liberal Democrats, the bearded <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> is a staunch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> conservative who won a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat last November with active campaign support from Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` The experts told me that if I had any chance of winning, I had to shave my beard and stay away from <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. I refused to do either, and I won,'' <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> said. Another conservative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, shaved off his beard and won re-election handily. But when liberal former Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., tried the same trick in his bid for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat last fall, he lost `` I had my beard for six years,'' <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where he is teaching college and reassessing his political future. `` I had it so long I was becoming identified with it. I was tired of being a <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> look-alike. Also, my mother hated it.'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., shaved a beard he'd worn for six months last year `` During that time, I got more nasty mail over my beard than over any other issue since I've been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Generally, they did n't like the way it looked, or thought it was unclean.'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, who intends to grow a new beard, believes the rise and fall of their popularity has some mysterious connection with the economy. `` When the stock market goes down, there are more beards, and when the market goes up there are fewer beards,'' he observes. `` When I showed up for the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, I was clean-shaven and the economy was back up again.''

 The future of abortion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s discussion agenda when its nine members gather for a closed-door conference Friday morning. First item: Must the court, in resolving an abortion-regulation controversy from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, plunge into its landmark 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies? Although Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> may conduct an initial vote Friday and begin the opinion-writing process, the court's final decision likely will not be announced until late June or early July. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are urging the court to overturn or curtail the 16-year-old ruling in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. And while speculating about the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s direction is always tricky business, questions from the bench in Wednesday's argument session indicated three key justices may be willing to undertake a broad review of abortion rights Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ all appointees of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ pointedly asked lawyers for both sides about the dimensions of abortion rights. `` Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not? A right to procreate?'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> asked the administration's lawyer. `` Do you deny that the Constitution protects that right?'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> asked the lawyer representing opponents of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, `` How can you derive -LRB- a fundamental right -RRB- without making a determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not?'' The justice added, `` It is very hard to say it just as a matter of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you make the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked the administration's lawyer about a 1965 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision striking down a state law that barred use of contraceptives _ the high court's first enunciation of the constitutional `` privacy'' right which served as the basis for <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. `` Does the -LRB- 1965 -RRB- case stand for the proposition that there is a right to determine whether to procreate?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked. Of the justices considered strong supporters of abortion rights _ <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ only <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> participated fully in the session. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> asked one question; <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> none. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, dissenters in and consistent critics of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, each asked several questions but seemed intent on giving the three junior justices as much time as they needed. Their questions could have zeroed in on the particulars of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law's regulations. Many of them did not. The court, however, still could resolve the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case without reconsidering <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. Such a decision still would be read as a barometer of the current justices' commitment to the 1973 ruling, but might not affect many women outside <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Higher stakes would be left for a future case. But the possibility exists for a broader ruling, one that includes in its scope a nation in which 1.5 million legal abortions are performed each year.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> traded charges of hypocrisy, lying and bad faith in a blistering finale to three weeks of debate on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting adjourned Wednesday without resolution and no further meeting was scheduled. The debate marked the first full-fledged council discussion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since January 1980, right after Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, replacing one Marxist government with another and staying on to help fight a Moslem insurrection. The session began April 11 and included more than 40 speakers, all of them calling for a political settlement and self-determination by the Afghan people. Ambassador <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the council, told delegates Wednesday, `` It is the height, or should I say the depth of hypocrisy for the representative of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to claim that the regimes in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> are fulfilling their obligations under the Geneva Accords of April 14, 1988, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have failed to do so. `` The truth is precisely the opposite ... distortion and falsehood will not work. `` The whole world knows full well who created the dreadful situation by its invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has at least withdrawn its troops but it is seeking to lay the blame for the chaos and continued suffering at the feet of others.'' Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> earlier delivered an extensive and stinging rebuke to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for arming the Afghan guerrillas with weapons transported across the border from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` The world community ... has formed a very clear idea about who is hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall,'' he said, jabbing his finger in the air for emphasis. Referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms being supplied to the rebels through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> gibed, `` We do n't believe babies are borne by storks or come from cabbage patches, so how did these arms from the territory of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> get there into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>? `` Did they fall out of the sky, or were they brought by some other force?'' Neither the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> admitted supplying weapons, including Stinger and Blowpipe missiles and other arms to Afghan guerrillas. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not setting the best example -LRB- of respect for international agreements -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said during an hourlong statement. `` By supplying the Afghan opposition with weapons on Pakistani territory, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has thereby been pushing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> toward a violation of the bilateral agreement between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' That U.N.-mediated agreement between the two west <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> neighbors, guaranteed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, calls for non-interference in domestic affairs of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It also provided for the Soviet troop withdrawal, completed in February. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> violated the accords by arming and training Afghan rebels in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and sending them into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> along with weapons convoys. They claim the Pakistani military, intelligence units, logistics officers and militia are involved _ both directly and indirectly _ in fighting within <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies it and says Soviet supply of weapons to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime has continued the warfare and suffering in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Most Afghans reject the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> says. Pakistani Ambassador <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> said in response to an Afghan threat of retaliation issued in the council Monday that his government will defend itself against any aggression from its neighbor.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> heads for the troubled island of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> on Friday, where opposition parties have declared a `` papal truce'' following violent anti-government protests. The pope later will go on the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of Reunion, to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and finally to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> on his nine-day trip, his fifth to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and the 41st foreign pilgrimage of his 10 -LCB- - year papacy The visit comes seven months after his tour of five southern African countries and underlines <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s emphasis on the fastest growing segment of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> counts 75 million adherents in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and expects the number to reach 100 million by the turn of the century. Among issues he is expected to address are human rights, AIDS, apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, foreign debt, the environment, the shortage of priests and the process of adapting African traditions to a faith imported from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a papal first, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will fly on the Concorde, although the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that will take him from Reunion to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> will not travel at supersonic speed because of the shortness of the trip. <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, a 235,000-square-mile island off southeast <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has been the scene of turbulent demonstrations against the government of President <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>, who has been in power since 1975 and was re-elected last month to a third seven-year term. At least five people have been killed and 74 wounded in the past week in demonstrations by opposition parties, which accuse the government of rigging the election. Opposition leaders said Tuesday they will suspend their demonstrations during the pope's visit, recognizing the work of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and the church `` in favor of democracy and the rights of man.'' About 25 percent of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>'s 10 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and the church has spoken out against some of <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON>'s policies. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said the pope is expected to stress the need for respect of human rights and political freedoms in <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. Church-state relations improved in recent years after <PERSON> Ratsiraka </PERSON> turned from many of his socialist policies to gain Western aid to tackle a severe economic crisis and protect the country's unique plant and wildlife. In Reunion, a French overseas territory where 90 percent of the 500,000 people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will be received by Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in the capital <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Denis </LOCATION> and address bishops from other <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> islands. The pope is expected to raise the issue of apartheid in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, a front-line state that provides headquarters in exile for the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ the main group fighting to end white domination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In a major document released in February, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> condemned apartheid _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial segregation _ as the `` most systematic'' form of racism in the world. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, previewing the trip on the condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> could provide the pope the opportunity to address the problem of AIDS, which is estimated to have stricken up to 20 percent of the male population. In the past, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> has urged compassion for AIDS victims. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has condemned the use of condoms as a means of stopping the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, prescribing abstinence as the best means of avoiding the fatal disease. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s smallest and poorest nations, has been strained by an influx of 650,000 to 800,000 refugees fleeing the civil war in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. The church is inviting the Catholic refugees to attend the papal events. The pope is scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on May 6.

 Brace yourself. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the cat IS the hat. But the good news is that not all Soviets like felines turned into fedoras, and in a kind of `` purr-estroika,'' members of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cat club are in animal-loving <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seeking advice on how to promote better treatment of their furry friends. `` The position of homeless cats in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is very difficult,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` The sanitary inspectorate is very strict on homeless cats and they destroy a lot of them. They poison them with different poisons and they make hats out of them,'' <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said. Dogs are no better off. `` It's not just cats they're after, but also dogs,'' <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said. `` They're very bad people, even people who have been setting up cooperatives'' to make and sell cat hats. Such profit-making cooperatives have become possible under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` perestroika,'' or social and economic reforms. While cruelty to cats is illegal in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it's not against the law to make hats out of them. `` Nobody is actually going to punish you if you turn a cat into a hat,'' <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said. How did the problem start? `` As we do n't have a tradition of looking after cats, some parents buy cats for their children simply as toys. So it happens that children can play with the cats until they get tired of them and then they let them out into the street and parents do n't say anything about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> brought a film crew that is making a movie about cats. They arrived Tuesday and will stay until May 2, visiting cat rescue centers and talking to experts. `` Three or four years ago such contacts between our countries would not have been possible. They probably would have said, ` You're completely mad. You ca n't do that,''' <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` It's only been possible since the process of perestroika starting in our country in 1985-86.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the first non-communist country the club has visited. `` We could n't have possibly not come to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, because there are almost legends about how -LRB- well -RRB- people treat their pets,'' <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said. `` We were very pleased indeed that we were approached to ask if we would be willing to hold their hands a little,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, deputy chairman of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. With uncharacteristic British immodesty, he said: `` We do have quite a good international reputation.'' Cats are increasingly popular in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where perhaps 30 million people keep felines as pets, <PERSON> Nepomnyaschy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s oldest and biggest cat club, was established in 1986 and has attracted 1,000 members. Its opening cat exhibit was attended by 80,000 people, he said. `` And the cats they were queuing to see were just household cats,'' he said. The film is targeted at young people and will be shown in movie theaters, and perhaps on television. `` The film we are going to make is a continuation of this propaganda of the advertisement of cats,'' said <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronov </PERSON>, the film's director and a <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> member. `` We'd like to make a film that shows that everything alive has a right to life.'' Incidentally, it's not just tough being a cat in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Owning one is n't easy either. For starters, there's no canned cat food, said <PERSON> Nepomnyaschya </PERSON>. The club recommends boiled hake, a kind of fish. There also are no covered cat litter pans, fitted plastic liners, or mint-scented cat litter. Soviets use plastic photo-developing trays filled with paper or sand, he said.

 Why should n't a crack at the fattest jackpot in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> create a ticket-buying frenzy? How else can you turn a one dollar lottery chance into a $ 100 million payoff? `` The lure of great prizes fires people up. There's a kick of anticipation,'' said <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a psychologist who counsels compulsive gamblers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The bigger the prize the better, even though they do n't have a snowball's chance in hell of winning.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Super 7 Lottery drawn Wednesday night was worth more than $ 100 million, the world's largest prize outside <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s $ 159 million pot divvied up in last December The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> prize illustrates how popular lotteries have become since <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> opened its game in 1964. Lottery sales are expected to top $ 15 billion this year in 32 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, up from an estimated $ 14 billion last year. Sales in at least eight states exceed $ 1 billion. `` The lottery is the poor man's stock market. It let's you fantasize about the lifestyles of the rich and famous,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Provincial Lotteries. For $ 1, players of Super 7 picked seven numbers from one to 80. The winner must match them against 11 numbers drawn. The official winning numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. The odds of winning were 9.6 million-to-one, and the pot grew because there was no winner for six weeks. Tickets were sold at a rate of 500 a second. In a scene reminiscent of a gold rush, rabid prospectors invaded <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> by car, bus and plane to queue up. It was as if an entire state had gone mad. `` It's a dream, the fantasy of getting rich, of never having to work again,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucum </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham-Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` People get to carry around a little extra glow.'' Part of the fascination was getting a piece of the action. `` Not many people really expect to win. But somebody's going to. Everybody wants to be part of the fun,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladieux </PERSON>, acting director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state lottery. `` It's generated a super-mega-jackpot.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurenda </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Ticket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, put in four extra phone lines and ran ads in newspapers for out-of-staters. He charged $ 100 for a minimum order of 50 tickets, twice the going rate. <PERSON> Madelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> came in person, spending $ 796 for roundtrip air fare from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` I had a vision a year ago that I won the largest jackpot in jackpot history. This is my chance,'' she said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, jetted in for tickets. `` It's only once in a lifetime that you get to participate in the largest gambling action in the history of mankind,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said Promoters bill lotteries as benign entertainment, but critics say players can spend their life savings or write bad checks to cover debts. `` There's a dramatic increase in lottery addicts,'' said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pathological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Gambling used to be immoral, sinful and illegal, associated with greed and crime. The lotteries are promoting it as an act of civic responsibility because it supports education, transportation and elderly programs,'' she said. Lotteries were introduced as a way to raise money without raising taxes. In a way of using a vice to fund a virtue, lottery proceeds pay for senior citizens programs in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, education in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and economic development in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. But states pocket an average of 35 percent of lottery sales, and the games account for only a small percentage of a state's budget. `` The lottery is a rather inefficient and ineffective method of general revenue. But nobody wants to raise taxes. That's a dirty word,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, who has studied state lotteries for 20 years. `` I look at the lottery as the flip side of work. Gambling gives the tantalizing thought of achieving success without work,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. `` It's an innocent diversion for a few days.'' The sheer magnitude of a $ 100 million treasure, and the chance to chase rainbows and get rich instantly has a strong American appeal. But while a dollar may make you rich, it can also cost you your privacy. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, a coal miner, won $ 5.6 million in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lottery in 1986 and spent $ 6,000 for a chain-link fence adorned with a `` no soliciting'' sign. One stranger asked him for $ 10,000 so he could buy new cars for his kids. A woman asked for $ 10,500 to have her breast enlarged.

 <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> its first victory of the spring by outdistancing Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> in the race for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s at-large seat in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. With 88 percent of the vote in and just 40 of the 334 precincts left to report, unofficial returns gave <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> 60,262 votes, or 53 percent, and <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> had 49,435, or 43 percent. Independent <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> received just 4,475 votes, while <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an independent who espoused white separatist views, claimed just 413. `` Tonight the best man won,'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. `` <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> won the special election for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s congressional seat because he was a better candidate than <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>. `` Vinich and the Democrats started with enormous advantages. In a campaign that was only 40 days long, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> had a towering lead in name identification and had an established campaign organization that only five months ago nearly won a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat.'' Before the polls closed, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complimented <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> for his campaign and touched on the Democratic victories in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> earlier this year. `` Our victories in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and our strong showing in the heavily Republican state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, proves two things,'' he said. `` One, the voters have responded to the Democratic message and vision for this country. `` And two, the Republican strategy of divisiveness, hate and gutter politics does not work, and the people will not accept it. From Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> waving the Confederate flag in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> to a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> pollster spreading lies about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has proven _ and even flaunted _ their gutter tactics.'' The special election was called to fill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vacancy created last month when <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> resigned to become defense secretary. At stake in the election was Republican pride, as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lost special elections in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> earlier this year.

 <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s move from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cabinet gave Democrats their best opportunity since 1978 to gain a seat on the congressional delegation. The Democrats fielded <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, who has spent 15 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and almost upset Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> last November. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> countered with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who just won a third term in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. The short campaign centered more on negative political portrayals than on specific philosophical differences. Both <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> boasted of being fiscally conservative, in favor of multiple use of federal lands, and concerned over health care issues. Both oppose gun control and voted in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to restrict public funding of abortions. Both support an amendment to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution that would let states restrict abortion. However, <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> has been quoted as saying abortion is a matter of personal choice. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said he was the candidate who aligned best with Sens. Wallop and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. `` The basic choice will be whether the people want continuity of the conservative representation we have had or to move over to the left of center and send a liberal to represent the state of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said often during the campaign. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> denounced Republican effors to paint him as a liberal tied to big labor and stressed that <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> must be represented within the majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to be part of a team that makes sure <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> gets the best from both sides of the aisle, from Democrats and Republicans,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at one point seemed on the verge of torpedoing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' campaign. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, a strategist hired to reverse <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fortunes, early on declared that he was calling the shots for <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> used those comments to charge that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a 56-year-old businessman, had lost control of his campaign. The 38-year-old Democrat also scored the Republicans for a telephone poll that implied <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> was a liar. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> countered by noting that the bulk of <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s campaign contributions came from out-of-state labor groups. He portrayed the Democrat as beholden to organized labor with little <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> support.

<HEAD>Report Says Few States Assure Safety of Lawn Care Treatments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Millions of homeowners hire companies to treat their lawns, but most states make no attempt to assure that workers are properly trained and that precautions are taken against chemical poisoning, says a public interest group. Public Citizen, a private environmental and consumer organization, says its national survey found far too few state laws and regulations aimed at protecting public health from hazards posed by lawn care chemicals. As a result, `` millions of Americans may be unwittingly exposed to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who wrote <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the survey. For example, the report said, nearly two-thirds of the states have no requirement for either training or testing lawn care employees. Two-thirds do not require that customers be provided with information on potential hazards of the chemicals used. Only a handful require notice before a lawn is treated or a warning that it has been treated. Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> also was the author of a recent report maintaining that many of the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the potential of causing long-term health problems including cancer, birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage as well as short-term ailments. The industry has defended its use of the chemicals, saying the companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for lawn care use. `` We have to be registered and certified in most states,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> says in her new report that while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approves chemicals and doses that may be used on lawns, some of the standards may be outdated and there is little federal regulation of companies that actually apply the chemicals. Federal regulations, for example, allow any company employee to apply chemicals as long as the worker is under the supervision of a person who is certified, but the certified employee need not actually be present when the treatment is applied. For the most part, government regulation is just as lacking on the state level, although the commercial lawn care industry has grown into a $ 1.5 billion business servicing more than 7 million households a year, the report said. `` Most states have failed to take the necessary steps to protect public health from the hazards associated with law care pesticides,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of Public Citizen. Here are some of the findings, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> survey: Only six states require both that advance notice be given of scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward. Those states are <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> require the warning signs, but no advance notice, while <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> require the advance notice but no post-treatment warning signs. A dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a state test. Those states are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Only in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> are lawn care employees required to be both trained and tested under state-supervised programs. In most states consumers also are left without detailed explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care chemicals, said Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. Only <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> require state information sheets to be provided to customers. Seventeen other states have some form of consumer information requirement, but in many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the pesticides being used, the report said. `` This is inadequate because pesticide labels are often difficult, if not impossible, to understand and do not tell the full story about a chemical's known or potential chronic health effects,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Yeutter Renews Last Year's Drought Assistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s federal aid programs of last year have been kicked into gear to help farmers through the 1989 version of drought and privation. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced on Wednesday the reactivation of some of the key parts of last year's drought assistance package, including permission to graze livestock and cut hay from land set aside for conservation use under 1989 crop programs. Those include programs for wheat, feed grains, rice and cotton. The emergency measures will apply to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and other states where drought has hurt 1989 crop prospects and in counties where farmers meet eligibility standards. `` Rain is what these states need, but I ca n't guarantee that,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` However, I trust the assistance we are able to provide will help.'' Livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus grain owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at half price. In a related program, CCC will help pay feed cost for farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for livestock. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had directed the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to respond within 24 hours to requests from the agency's state offices for drought aid. The emergency measures, he said, will `` have the potential'' to make substantially more acres available to farmers for haying and grazing this year and thus help stem any forced livestock liquidations. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had also instructed the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to sell hay at reasonable cost and take bids for livestock grazing on farmers taken over by the agency in counties where the emergency grazing of set-aside acres has been approved. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the aid package is essentially the same as <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> made available during the 1988 drought, which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and cut last year's harvests sharply. Asked if there were significant changes from what was offered last year, <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said, `` Not really, it's pretty straightforward.'' <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> is expected to benefit greatly from the emergency assistance, farmers in a number of other states are also expected to be eligible, including <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Others are expected to qualify, too, she said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also announced that a 1989 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> drought task force has been established, headed by Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, who oversees international affairs and commodity programs. The action followed <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s visit April 14 to the hard-hit winter wheat drought area, with Sens. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, all <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Republicans, and Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>. In a letter to <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had no authority to extend to 1989 wheat producers the broader relief provisions in last year's $ 3.9 billion Disaster Assistance Act, a move that had been sought by the governor. The 1988 law included disaster payments to farmers who lost at least 35 percent of their normal crop production. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., applauded <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s decision but said it was `` unfortunate it took him this long to respond. `` It does n't go far enough but at least it's a recognition that there are people who need help,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, `` and from here we can proceed to provide more help to them.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` These first steps ca n't take the place of a week's worth of rain or a green wheat field but it's the best news yet under the circumstances. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meteorologist, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that except in the central <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly. `` Conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said. But he said the damage from a February freeze and lack of spring rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter wheat crop in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> panhandles, west <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said he expects a more normal distribution of summer rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting that is beginning. Despite the severe damage to the winter wheat crop in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and private analysts think the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat harvest will be up substantially from last year when production dropped to 1.81 billion bushels. Unofficially, those put 1989 total wheat output at around 2.1 billion bushels or more. But that would not be enough to rebuild depleted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat stockpiles, siphoned off by export demand the past year. On June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat marketing year, the stockpile is forecast by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at a meager 549 million bushels, down from 1.26 billion bushels a year ago and 1.82 billion two years ago.

<TEXT>
 A last-minute change of heart by <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> will keep commercials out of the news show for schools that his <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to launch in August. The decision prohibiting ads on the new program from <LOCATION> Turner </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> puts the Atlanta-based company squarely at odds with <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, which has been testing a similar news show with commercials Educators who have criticized the Whittle program for letting companies pitch candy bars and shampoo to a captive audience applauded Turner. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> should be commended for responding to this ethical concern,'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, an executive of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he initially had planned to help pay for the daily 15-minute news program for schools by getting companies to underwrite up to two minutes of messages per show. The messages would advocate such causes as safe driving and the importance of staying in school. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he changed his mind after hearing <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> object to that type of advertising while at a private breakfast Turner held Wednesday for about 40 educators shortly before the news conference to announce the venture. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said the show, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION>, will cost millions of dollars, but he said <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> was profitable enough to absorb it. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based company that recently completed a seven-week test of its Channel One news service in six schools, said he still thinks his show with commercials is on the right track. The money Channel One collects for advertising will be used to supply each of the participating schools with about $ 50,000 in video recording equipment, TV monitors and satellite dishes if Whittle decides to expand the test nationally. `` We wish the cable industry the best of luck in its endeavor to bring free news and information programming to schools,'' <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said in a statement. But he added that Channel One `` successfully addresses what has been the gap between need and delivery in the past by delivering all of the components necessary to deliver news and information programming to students.'' Whittle is evaluating results of the test of Channel One and hopes to decide by midsummer whether to expand the service to as many as 10,000 schools nationwide in the fall of 1990. Turner is not supplying equipment to the schools, but will make teachers' guides with tips on how to use the material available to schools that have the right computer equipment to receive it. Three top cable operators _ <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intercable </ORGANIZATION> _ joined <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> at the news conference to express support for his program and pledged to see that schools in their areas each were equipped to receive the show. The three operators serve about a third of the estimated 50 million homes with cable nationally. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he expected individual cable operators would decide for themselves what to do if some schools can not afford video recording equipment or monitors. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> plans to run the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsroom </ORGANIZATION> show before dawn every school day so that teachers can record it and replay all or parts of it as they wish. Whittle sends Channel One by satellite overnight to participating schools and requires that the show be played once a day throughout the school. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> declined to say how much lost revenue his decision against any advertising cost the new program. But some industry insiders said the commercial-free news program could work to the entire industry's benefit by building up some goodwill at a time when calls have grown for more regulation of the industry.

<HEAD>Both Sides Find Reason for Hope in Abortion Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both sides of the abortion issue are finding grounds for hope as they await a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a key <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could alter the right of women to end their pregnancies. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> lawyer who urged the court Wednesday to strike down a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law restricting abortions, said he is not conceding any votes among the nine justices. `` I have given up on no one,'' he told reporters after the hour-long argument session that packed the courtroom and drew more than 200 demonstrators and spectators outside the court building. Twenty-seven `` pro-choice'' protesters were arrested for breaking through police barriers that lined the court building's plaza Referring to the court's 1973 ruling in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion nationwide, <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> said he believed the justices are now aware `` Roe works. You can not put the cork back in the bottle. You ca n't turn the clock back 16 years.'' Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who urged the court to uphold the state's abortion regulations even if it does not reverse the broader 1973 decision, also said he was pleased with the arguments. `` To the extent <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> works, you have to ask yourself why we are standing in front of the court'' 13 years after the case was decided and after numerous subsequent court rulings on abortion, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. He said the Missouri regulations are a lot less severe than the `` pro-choice'' forces claim and stop far short of outlawing abortions. `` The debate has been polarized and exploited. Frankly, -LRB- the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law -RRB- just does n't go that far,'' he said. Harvard law professor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, a former top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official, argued in behalf of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He urged the court to overturn its 1973 ruling, but declined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom after the argument session. The justices, who do not necessarily have to reconsider <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> in resolving the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dispute, gave little indication of how broad their decision will be. They are expected to announce their ruling by July. At one point, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> _ a potential swing vote along with Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ asked whether the court must consider the nature of a fetus. `` Can you derive -LRB- a fundamental right to abortion -RRB- without making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or not?'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> asked the lawyers. The justices will take their initial vote in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case Friday in a closed-door meeting. They will discuss their views, beginning a process that will include drafting and redrafting opinions. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said she was heartened by the discussion before the justices because it focused in part on the link between abortion rights and contraception rights. `` We've said all along the right to privacy is the same'' in both cases, she said. She and others in the abortion battle agreed the court's ruling, while potentially momentous, will not be the last word. <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` While the attention of the national press is on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today, it is important to keep in mind that pro-choice activities are occurring all across the country. We must take our message to the public today and tomorrow and every day until we settle this issue once and for all.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said opponents of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law `` are seeking to expand the right to abortion. The question is whether the court is ready to make that right more absolute.'' A federal appeals court, relying on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, struck down major provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law as unconstitutional. The law banned use of public hospitals for performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life; prohibited any public employee from performing or assisting an abortion or `` encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions; and required doctors to determine whether a fetus older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb by, for example, testing lung maturity.

<HEAD>Man Accused Of Murder Marries Potential Witness Against Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man accused of murder and a potential witness against him held hands through the jail bars that separated them as they were married, and now she can not be forced to testify against him. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonet </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> on Wednesday married <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who is charged with first-degree murder in the death of a car salesman. The victim was kidnapped during a test drive, robbed and shot. DeSoto Parish District Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, who tried unsuccessfully to get the courts to forbid the ceremony until after the trial, said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> will still be tried for the death of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Langton </PERSON>. `` It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the evidence in a case before it is tried, but the marriage of the witness will have absolutely no effect on the case going forward,'' <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> said. `` It is fixed for trial on June 26, and it will go to trial on June 26.'' <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> had said earlier that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was living with <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> when <PERSON> Langton </PERSON> was slain, and her testimony could destroy <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>'s alibi against charges of murder, aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery. Under state law, someone can not be compelled to testify against a spouse. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> got a marriage license Tuesday at the parish clerk's office On Wednesday, state District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledge </PERSON> waived the required 72-hour waiting period. The couple said their vows a few hours later before a Baptist clergyman. Two jailers served as witnesses and other jail employees gathered around for the double-ring ceremony. The couple won the right to marry April 12, when the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> upheld <PERSON> Sledge </PERSON>'s ruling that the state lacked the authority to prevent someone from marrying. Jail Administrator <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> spent several days calling ministers before he found one willing to marry the couple. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said on April 19 that he had changed his mind and wanted to postpone the wedding. But after talking with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> last weekend, he told <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> he was ready to proceed with the marriage.

<HEAD>Intelligence Committee to Investigate Non-Release of Documents</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will try to determine why congressional Iran-Contra investigators were not given crucial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration documents that turned up during the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The documents, which were missed during a supposedly thorough search of administration files during the panel's 1987 investigation, portray far more clearly than previously known the involvement of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in aid to the Nicaraguan rebels throughout 1985. Three former members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigating panel said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., and Vice Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, that a quick staff review found four documents introduced as evidence in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that they had never seen before Two other documents released at the trial are similar to ones in the committee's files, but include important attachments or notations that are missing from the committee versions. One document, an April 25, 1985, memo from then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, recommends that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephone Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> to reassure him of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is the notation, `` cc Vice President,'' apparently showing that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sent a copy of the memo. `` These six documents are sufficient to raise questions about the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing documents to the Iran-contra <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the completeness of its compliance with agreements on the provision of documents,'' the letter stated. The request was signed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, the chairman and vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra panel. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, in a statement, promised to `` look at this matter expeditiously and in a businesslike, non-political manner.'' Responding for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, White House Counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> on Wednesday: `` We have confidence that the last administration followed the agreed procedures -LRB- for releasing the material -RRB- and that its representatives will be able to address your concerns. We, of course endeavor to be as helpful as we can.'' The letter from the senators said some of the documents contain key evidence about the way <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials conducted policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in 1985 `` and raise questions regarding ... possible efforts to circumvent the provisions of the law'' which barred direct or indirect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. One of the documents, a Feb. 20, 1985, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, states it is `` very clear'' that the law forbids any direct or indirect military aid for the Contras. That is at odds with testimony by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other administration during the congressional hearings that they had believed they had found a loophole to get around the law. A similar request for an investigation was made two weeks ago by Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> committee An aide to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said Wednesday that he had not yet received a response to his request, which was directed to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Congressional investigators ultimately concluded in November 1987 that a `` cabal of ... zealots'' in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration seized control of policy in the affair which sent weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and profits from the sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. Despite the documents released in the North case, former committee counsel <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Belnick </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney, said he does not believe that conclusion would have been much different had the documents been turned over. `` The documents were clearly called for, we would like to have had them and they would have led to additional questions,'' he said. `` But if this is the sum and substance ... they would n't have materially changed any of the conclusions'' reached by investigators, he said. Among documents which the congressional panels did not receive: _ A Feb. 19, 1985, memo for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> outlining a plan to step up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for its support of the Contras, and proposing that an emissary go to <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> and `` very privately'' outline the link between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and help for the rebels Approval of the proposal is initialed, `` RR.'' _ A memo dated Feb. 20, 1985, from North and <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burghardt </PERSON> to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> noting that the emissary to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> would be needed to keep the request to aid the Contras secret from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ An Oct. 30, 1985, memo from North to <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> outlining plans for reconnaissance flights over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and mentioning plans to airdrop two recoilless rifles to the rebels _ A Feb. 22, 1985 memo outlining plans for delivery to <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> of a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> letter promising support for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> if needed against Nicaraguan military attack and saying, `` I hope that your government will do all in its power to support those who struggle for freedom and democracy.

<HEAD>Army Engineer Corps Says Its Ships Outperform Soviet Skimmer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Two dredging ships from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> have been modified to provide clean-up crews with their most effective weapon yet against the massive oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials say. The hopper dredging vessels normally pick up silt, sand and other debris from the bottom of harbors. Off the coast of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, however, the corps has shown that such ships can be altered to suck up huge quantities of oil floating on the ocean's surface. The two dredging ships are `` the major oil pick-up vehicles up there now,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> secretary for civil works, said in an interview Wednesday, `` We are really forging ahead with a new technology.'' Over the past week, the hopper dredges `` Essayons'' and `` Yaquina'' have managed together to pick up roughly 3,300 barrels of oil. That represents 36 percent of all the oil recovered since April 18, when the 200-foot <PERSON> Yaquina </PERSON> arrived on the scene, Page said. The 350-foot Essayons joined the Yaquina April 21. By comparison, Page continued, a Soviet oil recovery ship named the <PERSON> Vaydaghubsky </PERSON> that volunteered last week with great public fanfare to assist the oil clean-up effort has managed to reclaim only about 250 barrels. `` We always knew these vessels were versatile,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, the chief of the corps' operations and readiness division, adding it had taken the ships' crews only half a day to modify the dredges for oil operations. The technology being applied by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> corps is deceptively simple and involves only the rotation of the draghead _ the business end of a large boom that dangles off the side of the ship and leads to a huge hopper on board. In normal operations, the draghead is dropped into the water and pulled across the ocean bottom, sucking silt or sand into the boom and up into the hopper. According to Page and <PERSON> Elmore </PERSON>, the corps initially experimented by raising the boom and huge draghead level with the ocean surface, with disappointing results. When that did n't work, the corps decided to remove the dragheads from their booms, rotate them 180 degrees and then re-attach them. That simply turned the draghead and its huge suction mouth upside down, where it could be placed just below the ocean's surface and suck oil down instead of up `` It's set up like a giant vacuum cleaner,'' said Page. The inverted system was tested by the <LOCATION> Yaquina </LOCATION> on April 20 and in the course of just 15 minutes, the dredge sucked up 1,500 barrels of oil, Page added. The Yaquina and Essayons are now attacking the oil spill, when weather permits, by allowing smaller skimmers to corral a large quantity of oil and then moving in with the underwater draghead. The oil tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground on a reef off the coast of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on March 24, spewing an estimated 11.2 million gallons, or almost 267,000 barrels, of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The vessel was carrying a load of Alaskan crude to a refinery in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The Alaskan authorities have charged the tanker's master, Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, with operating the vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and the negligent discharge of oil.

<HEAD>Anti-Catholic Discrimination Charged in Fund for Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House members of the pro-Irish caucus say <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should renew support of an economic grant program in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, but nationalist critics say the program must first stop discriminating against the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. The International Fund for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is an outgrowth of the 1985 Anglo-Irish pact. The program seeks to ease violence between the Protestants and Catholics in British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by improving economic conditions with special grants designed to create jobs in the unemployment-wracked nation. Most of the fund's money has come from a three-year, $ 120 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid package pushed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mass. Fund advocates in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now are pressing for another three-year package to provide $ 50 million annually. `` The fund is the only way the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can play a constructive role in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, chairman of the Friends of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> congressional caucus. He was joined by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. Proponents cited new fund projects, such as one to build a shopping center in a poor <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood outside of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> that has no local food store. But Father <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and a leading fund critic, said there is `` blatant, naked discrimination'' against <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority in the distribution of funds. He called for a congressional investigation. In County Fermanagh, one of six counties in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, 87 percent of the fund money went to Protestants while <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> received 10 percent, he said. The county's Catholic-Protestant population is split 52 percent to 48 percent. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, national information officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, cited cases of abuse, including the use of fund money to build luxury hotels, saunas, golf courses and a $ 2 million British government fishing vessel. He called for a restructuring of the board to make it more independent of the British-controlled bureaucracy in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` If <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> headed the -LRB- fund -RRB- as currently structured, it would discriminate against Catholics,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. Subcommittee members, including Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said they back continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of the fund, but expressed concern over the reports of abuse and discrimination. `` My support of the fund should not be taken as blind faith,'' said <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who indicated that the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would look at placing new requirements on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contributions. <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON> said the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse is now auditing the program for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Results are expected within several months. But <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> urged the subcommittee to provide $ 50 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid without new conditions or restrictions. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, testifying with <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, said the subcommittee should not be swayed by the arguments of <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> because they are opponents of the fund and the Anglo-Irish pact. The majority leader specifically attacked <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s appearance before the subcommittee. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, according to his printed testimony, was appearing on behalf of his group and eight other Irish activist organizations, including Irish Northern Aid. That group is registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> militant group, according to <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. `` I do n't think they should really be welcomed,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, adding that it was the first time he knew of that `` an agent of a terrorist organization came before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he was not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and that his group did not advocate the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s violent activities.

<HEAD>Missile Deal Has Opponents from Both Parties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are predicting a fight over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to develop two kinds of land-based nuclear missiles and are targeting the committee chairman who helped work out the deal without consulting colleagues. House Democrats who support the Midgetman missile on Wednesday called the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal a `` sucker play'' that will ultimately use financial constraints to eliminate the single-warhead missile they support. Under the plan, a 10-warhead, rail-mobile MX missile would be deployed first. But both supporters and opponents were upset with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s failure to consult with them on what they considered a deal between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panels _ <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` It is not a rebellion,'' Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said after a meeting <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> held with about a dozen <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats `` It is a reminder to him that he was never authorized to make this kind of deal.'' The two-missile plan is putting <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in the position of supporting the MX, which liberal Democrats have opposed in the past, in order to avoid supporting two mobile systems. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., said the meeting became a bit testy when members pointed out that `` consultation is different than notification. The Oregon Democrat said his colleagues left `` a reminder card.'' The genesis of the MX-Midgetman plan is <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s original recommendation to move the nation's 50 MX missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing the Midgetman. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose quick deployment of the MX and research-and-development funding for the Midgetman. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget calls for $ 1.2 billion funding in fiscal 1990 for the MX and $ 100 million on the Midgetman. `` If you go through with those figures you might as well kiss the Midgetman missile good-bye,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` It's really a one-missile package,'' said <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, who charged that `` sequencing MX first is just a sucker play.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, chairman since 1985, said he spoke for himself in discussions on the MX and Midgetman missiles. `` I was talking from my own point of view and what was necessary to get through in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> hearing with <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> sought assurances that the Midgetman missile would not be squeezed out and suggested possible legislation to ensure development of the strategic weapon. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> also argued that the two land-based missiles are necessary as a bargaining chip for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiators dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` This issue of getting a consensus on where we go on land-based missiles is fundamental to whether we get a START agreement,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who told reporters he raised that point after <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> left the meeting. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had consulted with Republicans <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> about defeating the Midgetman. `` I think Les -LRB- <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> -RRB- miscalculated the extent to which the Democrats will fall in line,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> miscalculated Republicans falling in line to support the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> plan.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, who called the plan to fund Midgetman a `` bad decision,'' said budgetary constraints and demands of various domestic programs may force the hand of many lawmakers. `` While there has been debate in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over MX vs. Midgetman that debate has mainly taken place just among the defense intelligentsia of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` The problem among the rank-and-file membership has been increasing hostility to defense spending.''

 Grunt the half-ton pig, whose abandonment and near-slaughter touched the hearts of hundreds who wanted to give him a home, will spend the rest of his days roaming a ranch.

 Thanksgiving in April? Some Texans say a weary band of conquistadors was the first to give thanks and feast. Amateur and professional historians of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> say the first Thanksgiving feast was celebrated near present-day El Paso 23 years before the Pilgrims landed on <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. The association plans to re-enact the April 30, 1598, banquet on Sunday. About 6,000 to 8,000 spectators are expected, officials said. Mission Trail president <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said he wants the re-enactment to become an annual springtime Thanksgiving tradition.

Five days after running out of water, they came upon the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. The group spent 10 days hunting, fishing and recovering. Then, they sat down for a huge feast.

 The latest <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> shakeup is a `` tremendous victory'' for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, part of a methodical consolidation of his power and purge of his opponents, analysts say. `` It signals that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is strong, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration can not wait for two years to see whether he will be in power,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> forced the retirement Tuesday of 74 of the 301 voting members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and promoted 24 nonvoting members to full status. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s maneuver did not entirely rule out a backlash by Soviet conservatives, it appeared to guarantee him the top job for several years, strengthening his hand at home and abroad. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other administration officials, while welcoming <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to democratize Soviet politics and cut the size of the military, have warned that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader could be removed from power before the reforms are carried through. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has adopted a wait-and-see attitude in reaching new U.S.-Soviet accords, and administration spokesmen reacted cautiously Wednesday to the latest Kremlin developments, simply expressing hope that they will further reform. But private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed that the shakeup vastly strengthened <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hand. `` One has to count this as obviously a tremendous victory for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Thane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a Sovietologist at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But, said <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, `` what we have seen is a preemptive move, that shows that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is not entirely serene.'' By purging the so-called `` Dead Souls,'' <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who have lost the party and government jobs that won them a spot on the policy-making body, said <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself was telling us that he faced a threat.'' Only once since the 1920s has the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> played the decisive role in <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> politics, in 1957, when <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> summoned it to overturn a vote of the ruling Politburo ousting him as party leader. Seven years later, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and Politburo agreed to dump <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. The removal of the Dead Souls was `` a clear victory for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but not as decisive as it could have been,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Russian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It reduces the pressure he faces from conservatives.'' <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Simes </PERSON>, a Soviet emigre scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the Dead Souls were `` a potential pool of opposition'' who might have voted against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in favor of more conservative Politburo members, such as <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> or <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>. `` If you were <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, would you want one third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to have nothing to lose by going after you?'' said <PERSON> Simes </PERSON>. The 24 nonvoting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members who advanced to voting status include conservatives as well as reformers, said <PERSON> Simes </PERSON>. The one thing the new members have in common is that they owe their new status to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s latest action fits a pattern, including a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum last Sept. 30 in which he removed a number of aging Politburo members, including then-President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, and shifted <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> to new jobs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> lost his <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seat Tuesday, but <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> were not touched. `` What he has done as usual is to divide those that remain,'' said <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>. `` Now there is a big plum that he can dangle before people, telling them, ` You be good and I will make you a full member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.''' <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, who does not agree that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faced a threat from conservative Politburo members, viewed the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> purge as a calculated effort to strengthen the Soviet leader's hand at home and abroad. `` He has been strong all the way through, since 1986, in my opinion,'' said <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>. Soviet officials, said <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, have fostered the belief that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faced a threat from <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>. `` Now, they understand that this has had two bad consequences,'' said <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>. `` The stories about the <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> opposition were unsettling both to U.S.-Soviet relations and to peasants who have been reluctant to take out long-term leases.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> so far has balked at decollectivizing land seized from peasants in 1929-30, but instituted long-term leases to encourage them to boost production and profits on land to which they have exclusive rights. That program, key to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and to increasing Soviet food supplies, has drawn few takers among a deeply suspicious farming class. `` If they are going to persuade peasants to take leases, they have to convince them that there will not be a palace coup in two years,'' said <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant says the Exxon Valdez likely would have sunk and created a worse problem if its captain had succeeded in rocking the giant tanker off a reef where it spilled 11 million gallons of oil. Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> also praised Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who radioed a warning to Captain <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>: `` I would n't recommend doing much wiggling. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday that was sound advice for the vessel that rested atop a pinnacle of reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> with 42 million gallons of oil still in its hull. A transcript of the March 24 conversation between <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was released on Tuesday after a Freedom of Information request from the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's probable that had the ship gotten off the reef, it would have sunk in position where it was in about 300 feet of water,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told a news conference. The remaining oil was transferred off the ship before it was moved several days after the incident. It would have been much more difficult to remove the oil had the ship sunk, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know whether -LRB- <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s action -RRB- was ill-considered,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said in response to a question, `` but I think Commander <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> ... gave the captain some very sound advice. I hope what -LRB- <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> -RRB- ultimately did was in response to that advice which was not to jerk that thing off the pinnacle.'' The transcript showed that <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to `` take it slow and easy'' after the captain said he there was `` a little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the reef.'' The transcript shows that <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> warned, `` Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you do n't, you know, start doing any ripping.'' He added that the tide was still rising. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is charged with operating the vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of pollution into the water, all misdemeanors. Exxon earlier had estimated that 10.1 million gallons of crude oil had spilled from the ship. State officials said it was 11.2 million and <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> confirmed it was more than 11 million. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> was not on the bridge when the ship ran aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, who was qualified to operate the ship but not licensed to steer it through the sound. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s reference to a `` little problem ... with the third mate'' may have only been a reference to the ship's having run aground rather than an indication of any other problem with the third mate

 `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>,'' a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cleaning woman whose pregnancy led to the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion, watched quietly as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> revisited her case 16 years later. Recently emerged from the anonymity that had concealed her real name and kept her away from the court when it decided in her favor in 1973, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> was inside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday as an observer during its arguments on whether to overturn the Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. `` I'm very overwhelmed,'' she said later. `` I was just looking around and trying to listen to the arguments. I was thinking, I should have been there in 1973.'' <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, agreed to become a test case in the legal challenge of anti-abortion laws when she became pregnant with a second child in 1970. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, 41, answered questions with great difficulty and stumbled through a nine-line written statement as she met with reporters. Her present attorney, <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, assisted her and told reporters that <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> has only a modest income, cleans other people's homes for a living, and has a 10th grade education. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, a feminist lawyer from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> known for her flamboyance, has helped <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> put together a movie deal about her experience. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> is being paid as a consultant to the project. She has been in hiding since April 4, when shotgun blasts were fired at her <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> home. She suspects abortion opponents were trying to intimidate her. <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> disputed suggestions she has been used in the new case and said she stepped forward at considerable risk because she still believes in the cause of a woman's right to an abortion. `` Our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` I have to protect <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> said she considered an illegal abortion in 1970 but was revolted by conditions at a back-alley abortionist's office she visited. She did n't have an abortion. Instead she gave birth and put her child up for adoption. Her lawyer said <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> considered the experience `` far more traumatic to her than an abortion would have been.'' Yet <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON> said she has recently begun efforts to locate that adopted child, whose conception triggered the landmark case. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> insists there's no irony or inconsistency there. `` The whole point is it's about a woman's right to choose,'' she said. So what would <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> McCorvey </PERSON>, once <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, say to this child? `` Well, I obviously would n't discuss politics right away,'' she said. `` I'd just say, ` I'm your mom. How about a hug?'''

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> oral argument Wednesday in a case in which the justices are being asked to overturn the court's 1973 decision, in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that women have a constitutional right to abortion. Missouri Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: This case represents a direct appeal that involves a 1986 Missouri statute defining the rights of the unborn and regulating abortion in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Missouri's appeal involves three basic areas for this court's review: The first, the constitutional boundaries on the limitations of public funding; the second, the effect of and the facial constitutionality of legislation declaring that life begins at conception; and third, the ability of a state to require a physician to preform tests and to make and record findings when determining viability Finally, we have asked this court to reconsider the standard of review to be applied to state abortion regulation. Since 1973 this court has reaffirmed <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s mandate, state and lower federal courts have repeatedly interpreted that mandate, frequently strictly against the states. One result is that the states have effectively been forbidden, not only to prohibit abortion, but usually to regulate abortion in any significant way. ...

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: It seems to us a convoluted result to suggest that if you can afford an abortion, we have to provide one for you in a public facility but if you lack the financial capacity ... the state and other public governmental entities are not obligated to provide those services for you. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: Can I ask you one clarifying question? What is the consequence of a violation of that section. ... What if a doctor who had a patient in a public hospital went ahead and performed, in the first trimester, performed an abortion. Is there any sanction against the doctor if he did that? <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: This particular chapter -LRB- of the law -RRB- carries a general misdemeanor penalty for violations ... but there is no operative language. ... <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: So it would be a misdemeanor then? <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: Arguably, it would be a misdemeanor. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: What is your opinion? Do n't you know? <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: My opinion is that there is no language in that section which was adopted here which would suggest that it would make it a criminal offense. ... <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: Is it your opinion as the chief enforcement officer of the state that it would not be a misdemeanor? Webster: We would n't view that violation as a misdemeanor, no. ...

<TEXT>
 Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>: Would n't it be grounds for discharge ...? <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: It is conceivable the hospital board could, if somebody violated the policy of that facility, seek to discharge that particular employee. ...

<TEXT>
 Charles Fried for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration: Today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asks this court to reconsider and overrule its decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. At the outset I would like to make quite clear how limited that submission is. First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in -LRB- previous -RRB- cases. ... Rather we are asking the court to pull this one thread. And the reason is well stated by this court ... abortion is different. It involves the purposeful termination, as the court said, of potential life. And I would only add that in the minds of many legislators who pass abortion regulation, it is not merely potential life but actual human life. And though we do not believe that the -LRB- Constitution's -RRB- 14th Amendment takes any position on that question, we think it is an utter non sequitur to say that, therefore, the organized community must also take no position in legislation and may not use such a position as a premise for regulation. Kennedy: Your position then is that <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> -LRB- striking down a state's ban on contraceptive sales as an invasion of personal privacy -RRB- is correct and should be retained? Fried: Exactly, your honor. Kennedy: Is that because there is a fundamental right involved in that case? Fried: In <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> there was a right which was well established in a whole fabric of quite concrete matters, quite concrete. It involved not an abstraction such as the right to control one's body, an abstraction such as the right to be let alone, it involved quite concrete intrusions into the details of marital intimacy. ... Kennedy: Does the case stand for the proposition that there is a right to determine whether to procreate? Fried: <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> surely does not stand for that proposition. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>: Do you say there is no fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not? A right to procreate? Do you deny that the Constitution protects that right? Fried: I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract terms and I think the court prior to <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> quite prudently also avoided such sweeping generalities. O'Connor: Do you think that the state has the right to, if in a future century we had a serious overpopulation problem, has a right to require women to have abortions after so many children? Fried: I surely do not. That would be quite a different matter. O'Connor: What do you rest that on? Fried: Because unlike abortion, which involves the purposeful termination of future life, that would involve not preventing an operation, but violently taking hands on, laying hands on a woman and submitting her to an operation. ... O'Connor: And you would rest that on substantive due process protection? Fried: Absolutely. Kennedy: How do you define the liberty interests of the woman in that connection? Fried: The liberty interest against a seizure would be involved. That is how the court analyzed the matter in <LOCATION> Griswold </LOCATION>. ... Kennedy: How do you define ... the liberty interest of a woman in an abortion case?

<TEXT>
 Fried: Well, I would think that there are liberty interests involved in terms, perhaps, of the contraceptive interest ... At all points it is an interest which is matched by the state's interest in potential life ... I would like to make clear that, in our view, if <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> were overruled, this court would have to continue to police the far outer boundaries of abortion regulation under a due process rational basis test, and that test is muscular enough ... to strike down any regulation ... which did not make proper provision for cases where the life of the mother was at risk. ... <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>: Is there a difference between the court's power in the case of an abortion that would be life threatening to the woman and an abortion that would merely cause her severe and prolonged disease? Is there a constitutional difference? Fried: I think that is a matter of degree, and it is perfectly clear that severe health effects shade over into a threat to the life. I can not promise the court that our submission would dispense the federal courts from considering matter like that. ...

<TEXT>
 Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>: Suppose there is a state that permits abortions and they are done in public hospitals. Do you think that is a _ you say that there is human life involved, that is destroyed in abortions _ is there some problem about the state permitting abortions? Fried: I think the Constitution takes no position on this point. ... The country's experience and the court's experience under the constitutionalization of that issue has been so regrettable that I could not in conscience recommend that it be constitutionalized in some other way at another point in the spectrum. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Susman </PERSON> for those who challenged the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law: I think -LRB- Fried's -RRB- submission is somewhat disingenuous when he suggests to this court that he does not seek to unravel the whole cloth of procreational rights, but merely to pull a thread. It has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread, my sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is after. It is the full range of procreational rights and choices that constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by this court. For better or for worse, there no longer exists any bright line between the fundamental right that was established in <LOCATION> Griswold </LOCATION> and the fundamental right of abortion that was established in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>. These two rights, because of advances in medicine and science, now overlap. They coalesce and merge and they are not distinct. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>: You find it hard to draw a line between those two but easy to draw a line between first, second and third trimester. I do n't see why a court that can draw that line ca n't separate abortion from birth control quite readily <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>: ... Things have changed. The bright line, if there ever was one, has now been extinguished. That's why I suggest to this court that we need to deal with one right, the right to procreate. ... Kennedy: Do you agree that the state can forbid abortions save to preserve the life of the mother after the fetus is, say, eight months old? Suppose the health rights of the mother are not involved? ... Susman: Yes, I am willing to recognize the compelling interest granted in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> of a state in potential fetal life after the point of viability. Kennedy: But that is a line drawing, is n't it? <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>: Yes, it is. But that is a line that is more easily drawn. ... Procreational interests are, indeed, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and neither liberty nor justice would exist without them. It is truly a liberty whose exercise is deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition. ... I suggest that there can be no ordered liberty for women without control over their education, their employment, their health, their childbearing and their personal aspirations. There does, in fact, exist a deeply rooted tradition that the government steer clear of decisions affecting the bedroom, childbearing and the doctor-patient relationship as it pertains to these concerns. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>: It is a deeply rooted tradition, but surely abortion was regulated by the state in the 19th century and in the 20th century. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Scalia: Let me inquire _ I can see deriving a fundamental right from either a long tradition that this, the right to abort, has always been protected. I do n't see that tradition. But I suppose you could also derive a fundamental right just simply from the text of the Constitution plus the logic of the matter, or whatever. How can you derive it that way here without making a determination as to whether the fetus is a human life or not? It is very hard to say it just is a matter of basic principle that it must be a fundamental right unless you make the determination that the organism that is destroyed is not a human life. Can you as a matter of logic or principle make that determination otherwise? <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>: I think the basic question ... whether this is a human life or whether human life begins at conception, is not something that is verifiable as a fact. It is a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith. It is a question of labels. Neither side in this issue and debate would ever disagree on the physiological facts. Both sides would agree as to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides would agree as to when brain waves can first be detected. But when you come to try to place the emotional labels on what you call that collection of physiological facts, that is where people part company. Scalia: I agree with you entirely but what conclusion does that lead you to? That, therefore, there must be a fundamental right on the part of the woman to destroy this thing that we do n't know what it is. Or, rather, that whether there is or is n't is a matter that you vote upon. Since we do n't know the answer, people have to make up their minds the best they can. <PERSON> Susman </PERSON>: The conclusion to which it leads me is ... it must be left as a fundamental right. ... Women do not make these decisions lightly. They agonize over them. And they take what we see out front -LRB- of the building -RRB- and what we see in the media and they personalize it.

 A father tearfully unhooked his comatose baby son's life-support system early Wednesday, then took him into his arms and kept hospital workers at gunpoint until the child was dead, authorities said. `` I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to plug my baby back in,'' police quoted <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> as saying. `` You can understand the motivation,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. `` I guess he did n't want his child to continue living under those conditions.'' The painter from west suburban <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> was charged with murdering his 16-month-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office. `` This is the best thing,'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, told radio station WBBM-AM. `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> is out of his misery.'' At an evening court hearing, a judge ordered <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> released on a $ 75,000 recognizance bond, which means he does not have to post money unless he fails to appear at future hearings. But his release was delayed until early Thursday, when his family raised $ 1,000 bail for an oustanding warrant from an unrelated incident in <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, in arguing that <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> be held in jail, told Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON> that the weapon was cocked and <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> had threatened to `` kill anybody who interfered.'' `` We feel that showed that the defendant is a danger; that life-threatening actions were taken toward the nurses and other people,'' <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON> told <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> to appear in court again on Thursday. About 25 people turned out in support of him, including his wife, and his mother, father, brother and family friends. Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> is not charged in the boy's death. The couple has two other children, both under 5. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> also unhooked his son's life support system on Dec. 30 but staff members reconnected it, Detective <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> arrived early Wednesday, he spoke briefly with security personnel but was not searched, <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> added. Doctors had notified the parents Tuesday that the child was to be transferred to a long-term care unit, said Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> Police said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> and his wife walked into the hospital about 1 a.m. and were escorted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where their son's breathing had been sustained by a ventilator since an accident in August. About 20 minutes later, after his wife left the room for a drink of water, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> pulled out a .357 - caliber Magnum handgun, ordered hospital staff out of the unit, unhooked the infant from the life-support system and sat with his son in his One nurse disregarded <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' order and attempted to reconnect the system, but left the room when he cocked the hammer of the handgun, police said. Three other youngsters were in the unit while about a half-dozen security personnel called by a nurse stood helpless just outside the room, said Rush-Presbyterian spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> eventually allowed nurses to enter the unit and remove the three other youngsters. After about 30 minutes, his own child was dead, <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. `` He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,'' said <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON>. `` He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired, then turned the gun over to the officers.'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> was `` calm at times ... he did a lot of crying,'' said <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON>. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> had unhooked his son's life support system during a Dec. 30 visit, and staff members had reconnected the breathing apparatus, <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> had spoken with security personnel and received required clearance when he arrived in at the hospital, but was not searched. Police and hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said no charge resulted from the earlier incident because police had not been notified. `` The child's condition was n't changed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lineras </PERSON> had been arrested on misdemeanor charges three times in recent years, but the counts were unrelated in nature to Wednesday's charge, said a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case. <PERSON> Lineras </PERSON> was never convicted, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> was taken to Rush-Presbyterian by ambulance last August with a blocked windpipe after he swallowed an object, believed to be either a balloon or a small piece of aluminum foil. Oxygen deprivation left him `` partially brain dead,'' according to Ms. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been in a coma since his arrival. Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son then, despite their pleas to the contrary. In the working-class neighborhood where the Linareses live, neighbors expressed both resignation and surprise. `` They were very, very polite people,'' said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kielb </PERSON>, who lived two doors away. `` I ca n't imagine what possessed him unless he got a bill in the mail. You ca n't say he did n't love that baby.'' Across the street, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> said she had asked <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> on Tuesday how the baby was doing and he responded with a shrug, `` Still the same.'' `` It shocked me,'' she added. `` He was too nice of a guy.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> talked often of the child, telling her recently the couple already had made funeral arrangements for <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legislation to improve the transportation of coal from mines to distant power plants through pipelines. The committee approved the bill, the Coal Pipeline Act, on a 22-13 vote on Wednesday. It allows coal pipeline companies approved by the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary to use the federal power of eminent domain to gain access to land so they can lay pipes. The technology has existed for years to use pipes to transport coal mixed with water. The bill, which has yet to be taken up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, covers such `` slurry'' pipelines as well as those in the future using other media, such as natural gas, to transport coal. `` This legislation will increase our energy security, create new jobs, and provide much needed competition in the coal transportation market,'' said committee Chairman <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz.

 The vicious attack and rape of a jogger in Central Park by a gang of teen-age hoodlums has left many New Yorkers trying to make sense of a senseless crime. The victim, a 28-year-old investment banker, remains in a coma. Eight of her alleged attackers, ages 14 to 17, are in custody. Two were indicted Wednesday and indictments against the others were expected today. But by some accounts, the youths seemed unlikely attackers although several came from broken homes and all lived in a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> neighborhood surrounded by drugs, alcohol, crime and poverty. `` I deal with kids in trouble, these were not kids in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, principal of the junior high school two of the boys attended. `` They come from homes of parents who care, parents who are as shocked as we are.'' Their victim was on a solitary jog in the northern end of the park the night of April 19. She was beaten unconscious with a lead pipe and rock, raped and left bound and nearly naked. She was found several hours later. Doctors at <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she has been in critical condition in a coma since the attack, say that although she may survive it's unlikely she will ever recover completely. The woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang as it went `` wilding'' through the park that night. The term was a new one to the police, but not the activity. For years, loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the streets and parks bullying, robbing and attacking victims at random. `` I ai n't going to say it's fun. It's getting your anger out at somebody. It's like stealing fruit. It's not'cause you are hungry,'' a 15-year-old boy who said he was a friend of one of the suspects told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight assaults during the rampage and discussed `` getting whitey'' or `` getting a white jogger.'' The victim is white and the accused attackers are black. However, law enforcement experts say victims of the so-called `` wolf packs'' are more often black than white, and the lawyer for one of the youths denied the boy suggested the gang go after a white victim. The suspects are being held on charges of attempted murder, rape and assault and could face other charges. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> of the national board of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION> said the violence of city life allowed the boys to bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack. `` They're human beings who went berserk,'' she said. `` They had fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on television, the ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in control, macho, aggressive, strong.'' Police said only one of the suspects _ 17-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> _ had a police record. But friends said he was a frequent churchgoer who played drums for the choir. After their arrests, <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> and Kharey Wise, 16, were roughed up in an attack by several other inmates and <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, 15, was attacked by another youth at the <ORGANIZATION> Spofford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a 15-year-old schoolmate of suspect <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, 15, said: `` He's a good kid, he just followed the wrong crowd. If you're in the wrong crowd, this could happen to anybody. You have to make your own decisions, that's all.'' Since the attack, hundreds of runners, neighbors of the suspects, friends of the woman and other New Yorkers have gathered in the park and outside the hospital to pray for the victim. `` We're here today to pray in sympathy with the victim and her family,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, president of the residents' council of the housing development where four of the eight suspects live, said at a vigil he organized Tuesday. `` Through prayer we can heal the wounds on her body and the racial wounds this has caused to society.'' Friends and strangers have filled her room with flowers. The park has a reputation _ largely undeserved police and city officials say _ of being a dangerous place. `` It's notorious because it is Central Park. If this had happened in the streets, it would n't be anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Haws </PERSON>, who takes tourists on carriage rides through the park.

<TEXT>
 The governing party rammed the 1989 budget through committee today, setting the stage for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to fulfill his pledge to resign to take responsibility for the Recruit corruption scandal. But the question of who will be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister was thrown into confusion as the top contender, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, said he would decline any offer to succeed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. An advisory board to the the prime minister today recommended an overhaul of regulations governing politicians' fund-raising to avoid the conflict of interest and influence-peddling that have dogged <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s administration. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged Tuesday to resign after the budget's passage to take responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock-profiteering and bribery scandal, which has buffeted his administration for 10 months. The Budget Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s powerful lower house, took just one minute to approve the budget The session was boycotted by opposition party members. Japanese lawmakers like to operate by consensus so the boycott was seen as more than just symbolic. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was expected to force the budget through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, again in the absence of the opposition, which is demanding new parliamentary elections and that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> be summoned to testify about his role in the scandal. There still was no clear successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, as many senior <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders are linked to the scandal. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, widely viewed as the top candidate for interim premier, said today that he would not serve due to poor health. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 76, has heart problems caused by diabetes. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met Wednesday with <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, secretary general of the governing party, and the two agreed to decide after a holiday week that ends May 6 on a new party president, who will automatically become prime minister. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Masaharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotoda </PERSON>, an ex-chief of the national police who served as the top Cabinet aide to <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, might be an appropriate choice. <PERSON> Gotoda </PERSON>, 76, now heads an ethics panel appointed by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and comprised of members of the governing party. Another blue-ribbon panel made up of prominent members of the private and academic sectors today recommended a series of reforms, including requiring all members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to make public their assets and banning them from trading in stocks or giving monetary gifts at funerals and weddings. Currently only Cabinet members must divulge their assets. There are no restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on stocks, and parliamentarians routinely spend huge sums on wedding and funeral offerings to their constituents. Oppositionists blasted the Liberal Democrats' strong-arm tactics on the budget, complaining that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s impending resignation was not enough to resolve the Recruit scandal. The budgetary moves came a day after the suicide of a former <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> aide who handled <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s political funds. <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, 58, who had served <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since 1958, was found dead in his <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> apartment after he slashed his wrist and ankle and hanged himself. It was in <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>'s name that stock dealings and a $ 384,000 loan from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm at the center of the scandal, were carried out. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> is among more than a dozen politicians and political aides who bought shares of a subsidiary of Recruit, a giant business services conglomerate, before they were offered publicly, thus reaping huge profits. In all, more than 150 political, business and media figures purchased the shares. The transactions, though not illegal, badly tarnished the image of the governing party and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s admnistration. Three of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers resigned when it was discovered they or their aides had purchased the stocks or received sizable contributions from Recruit. A widely unpopular tax reform also forced through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year contributed to public and political outcries against <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, plunging his support rate to historic lows _ 3.9 percent according to one poll this month.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Highers, Share Prices In Tokyo Hit Record</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar edged up against the Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> ended at yet another high. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 190.15 points for a 33,434.93-point record close Wednesday, added another 65.90 points, or 0.20 percent, to finish at 33,500.83. The dollar closed at 132.05 yen, up 0.58 yen from the previous day's 131.47-yen finish. It started at 131.90 yen and edged up while ranging from 131.70 yen to 132.25 yen. Traders said the dollar opened higher in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following its strength in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where a release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth figures boosted dollar-buying. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday the nation's economy, as measured by its gross national product, expanded at a robust annual rate of 5.5 percent during the first three months of 1989, the fastest pace in more than a year Japanese investors were reluctant to make further purchase of the currency due to speculation about an interest rate hike in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s market intervention if the dollar rises further, said a trader with a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Many investors are speculating that the central bank might raise the nation's interest rate depending on the consumer price index for March, which is to be released Friday. But a trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said bullish sentiment for the dollar remains a basic trend. On the stock exchange, a moderate gain in the market's main barometer followed a similar trend on overseas markets overnight, dealers said.

 A gun-wielding father who tearfully unhooked his comatose son's life-support system and held him until the baby died has been charged with murder for an act he said he committed `` because I loved my son.'' <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> entered the hospital room of his 16-month-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, and unhooked the boy's ventilator, holding hospital workers at bay with a .357 - caliber Magnum handgun, police `` No one has the right to take the law into his own hands,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Partee </PERSON>. `` The facts of this case clearly dictate the filing of first-degree murder charges.'' At the hearing Wednesday night, prosecutors said the 23-year-old <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> house painter should be held without bail on the murder charge because the gun was cocked and <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> had threatened to `` kill anybody who interfered.'' But Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> released on a $ 75,000 recognizance bond, which means he does not have to put up any money unless he fails to appear at future hearings. The judge told him to return to court today. Following <PERSON> Ruttenberg </PERSON>'s order, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> was taken into custody by police from <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION> on an unrelated December warrant of battery and resisting a police officer. He was released early today after posting $ 1,000 at the suburban jail, police said. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON>, joined close relatives and about 20 friends at the hearing. `` Nobody has a right to call him a murderer, because <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> was already dead,'' said <PERSON> Linares </PERSON>' 22-year-old brother, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>. `` He was hurting. Put yourself in his situation. It was his son. `` For eight months he went through so much pain and agony. ... This was killing and eating my brother away inside.'' `` I did it because I loved my son, alright? I love my wife,'' <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> shouted to reporters after his arrest. At 1:20 a.m. Wednesday, <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> ordered hospital staff out of the pediatric intensive care unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>'s Medical Center, where the boy's breathing had been sustained on a ventilator since August, police He then unhooked the boy from the life-support system and sat crying with his son in his arms, police said. `` I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to plug my baby back in,'' police quoted <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> eventually allowed nurses to enter and remove three other youngsters. Sgt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said the child died about 30 minutes after the incident began. `` He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,'' <PERSON> Rooney </PERSON> said. `` He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired, then turned the gun over to the officers.'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> was `` calm at times ... he did a lot of crying,'' said Detective <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON>. Later, Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> said: `` This is the best thing. <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> is out of his misery.'' <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> had unhooked his son's life support system during a Dec. 30 visit, but staff members reconnected the apparatus, <PERSON> Bulava </PERSON> said. A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said no charge resulted from the earlier incident because police had not been notified. Rush-Presbyterian spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> had been brought to the hospital last summer with a blocked windpipe after he swallowed an object, believed to be either a balloon or a small piece of aluminum foil. Oxygen deprivation left him `` partially brain dead,'' according to Ms. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, and the boy had been in a coma since his arrival eight months ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> said doctors worked 12 hours to resuscitate her son at the time, despite their pleas to the contrary. The <PERSON> Linares </PERSON> family previously had asked about disconnecting the life-support system, but the medical center told them it could not do so without a court order because there still was some sign of brain activity. The family had been scheduled to meet with a lawyer Friday to discuss the matter.

 As a young girl in western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> hawked hot dogs and popcorn at an amusement park as she dreamed of starring in movies, hometown friends recalled. `` She always talked about being a star,'' said <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopus </PERSON>, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. Miss Ball, born 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> on Aug. 6, 1911, grew up in nearby <LOCATION> Celoron </LOCATION>, a rural hamlet on <LOCATION> Chautauqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Lopus </PERSON> remembered the sitcom star on Wednesday as `` daring in many ways.'' `` She tried to get me to run off -LRB- to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lopus </PERSON> added. `` But I did n't have the nerve.'' At 15, Miss Ball worked as a barker at the amusement park, screaming for people to buy popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice. Later, she starred in high school plays and got her start in front of a large audience on the vaudeville stage at the defunct Palace Theater in <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>. Although Miss Ball had n't visited <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> since 1956 and had no family there, she stayed in touch with friends. `` Even though she was a big star, she was still just <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> to us,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosseti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Celoron </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosseti </PERSON> said Miss Ball recently sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. Miss Ball regularly donated money to charities, civic events and <ORGANIZATION> Jamestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. On May 20, Miss Ball was to receive an honorary degree from the college and had planned to return to <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, now a city of about 40,000. Residents had put up posters saying `` <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loves </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucy </LOCATION>'' in storefronts and home windows. After Miss Ball suffered a heart attack last week, residents decided to sign the posters and send them to her as a get-well greeting. More than 150 posters were sent with 10,000 signatures. The 77-year-old comedian died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, the main heart artery, at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where she was recovering from last week's emergency heart surgery. `` It is a sad day for all of us,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Garifi </PERSON>, an organizer of the welcoming event. `` But I'm sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world.'' <PERSON> Garifi </PERSON>, community relations director for the community college, said the honorary degree will be awarded posthumously. Future generations in <LOCATION> Celoron </LOCATION> will have a reminder of their famous resident every time they drive or walk down the street where she grew up _ it will be renamed <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. Village officials had planned formal ceremonies renaming the street when she was due in the area next month. `` But it will happen anyway,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodell </PERSON> of the village's historical society said Wednesday When the society was formed about a year ago, <PERSON> Goodell </PERSON> said: `` We sent an invitation to <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> to be a member, and she sent back a check for $ 500 for a life membership. `` It was a check written in a very bold hand with a signature about a half inch high.''

<HEAD>Study Raises Questions about Common Prostate Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The most common kind of prostate operation may not be as effective as traditional surgery for relieving prostate woes in older men, a study published today concludes. A form of surgery called transurethral prostatectomy has largely replaced traditional open surgery to cut away enlarged prostate glands. In the newer procedure, surgeons push a thin tube up the urethra to the prostate, where a cutting loop slices the excess tissue. Patients recover more quickly and have less pain with this approach. However, new data from three countries suggests that men are substantially more likely to require a second operation after the transurethral procedure. In addition, the researchers said their data `` raise the possibility'' that men are more likely to die in the years immediately after the transurethral operation, although they said more study is necessary to be sure this is true. The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Noralou </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manitoba </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. It was based on the records of 36,703 men undergoing prostate surgery in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 5,284 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and 12,090 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The need for second operations ranged from 12 percent to 16 percent of patients in the three countries undergoing transurethral surgery, compared with 2 percent to 5 percent of those getting open surgery. The death rate during eight years of followup was higher in the transurethral patients in all three countries. This difference was most carefully analyzed in the Canadian patients, and the researchers found that those getting the transurethral procedure there had a 45 percent higher death rate. The excess of deaths was due mainly to more heart attacks. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said the study `` does not provide convincing evidence that open prostatectomy carries less risk than transurethral prostatectomy.'' He said men might have been more likely to get the transurethral procedure if they already had heart disease.

<TEXT>
 A 60,000-year-old Neanderthal neck bone resembles its counterpart in modern humans, suggesting the ancient creatures were anatomically equipped to speak, researchers reported today. Scientists are interested in the Neanderthal's capability for those sounds because it bears on the question of whether Neanderthals were direct ancestors of modern man or simply an evolutionary dead end. The discovery of the tiny, U-shaped bone is reported in the British journal Nature by reseael, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Moorhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in Minrchers from <LOCATION> Isranesota </LOCATION>. Other scientists said the find is unlikely to end the debate about Neanderthal speech capabilities. The Neanderthals, who lived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> until about 35,000 years ago, undoubtedly did communicate in some fashion because their culture was relatively advanced, scientists say. The debate is whether they were physically able to speak. The new fossil, unearthed from <LOCATION> Kebara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cave </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is a hyoid bone. In the body, the hyoid lies between the root of the tongue and the larynx. In the Nature paper, the researchers said the fossil bone is almost identical in size and shape to modern hyoids. Along with other evidence, that suggests that that the larynx, or voice box, also he <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Secondly, he said he does not see how the isolated bone will help scientists determine the position of the larynx in the throat. He called that crucial to the question of <PERSON> Neanderthal </PERSON>'s speech capabilities. The larynx is lower in the throat of modern humans than it was in very early ancestors, he said. The lower position allows for the space above it to act as a resonating chamber, which is required for fully articulate speech, he said. In an editorial accompanying the Nature paper, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> of the Radcliffe Infirmary at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, cautioned that determining function from anatomy is tricky. The argument about <PERSON> Neanderthal </PERSON> language capability, he wrote, `` will undoubtedly run and run until we discover a deep-frozen <PERSON> Neanderthal </PERSON> who is susceptible to resuscitation.'' A second report in Nature confirms an earlier study that suggested anatomically modern humans lived in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> some 90,000 years ago. That was more than twice the age scientists had been able to establish reliably for the existence of anatomically modern humans. Scientists from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> studied the age of cattle teeth associated with human remains in the <LOCATION> Skhul </LOCATION> cave at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>. They found that the teeth, and so the humans, are at least about 81,000 years old and more probably about 101,000 years old. That resembles the age of about 92,000 years reported last year for similar humans in the Qafzeh cave in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Anatomically modern humans may have occupied the area only intermittently during that era, study co-author <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON> said in an interview. Neanderthals probably were more established there, but it is not clear whether they encountered the anatomically modern humans, said <PERSON> Stringer </PERSON>, curator of fossil hominids at the British Museum -LRB- Natural History -RRB- in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 As the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments on a woman's right to an abortion and as thousands demonstrated nationwide, one woman made final plans for an abortion at the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> clinic that started the case. `` My finances wo n't let me have another child. I think I should have the right to choose,'' the 23-year-old woman, who spoke on the condition on anonymity, said Wednesday. `` There were more concerns in the waiting room this morning,'' said <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which initiated the case before the nation's high court by challenging restrictions in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s abortion law. `` There is an awareness, an edge today that I have n't seen previously.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could use its ruling in the case of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services to tighten or even overturn its landmark 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision that legalized abortion. The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> clinic, a target in the past of many anti-abortion protests, was quiet Wednesday. But from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, people marched and spoke out at rallies on both sides of the issue. The crowds were mostly pro-choice, and many who had abortions told their stories. `` I am compelled by the thought that someone else ... could have made such a personal decision for me,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Shang </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who spoke before 800 pro-choice demonstrators in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. She said she had an abortion at age 19. `` We are committed to a woman's inalienable right to her own womb,'' she said. `` It is not the property of the state. It is not the property of the church.'' But in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nola </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told reporters she had two abortions before becoming an abortion foe. `` Abortion is a major death experience. Women can not participate in the death of their own child and not be psychologically impaired,'' she said. About 2,000 pro-choice demonstrators rallied at the state capital in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and a half-dozen abortion opponents gathered nearby. The abortion foes approached the rally, but were surrounded by pro-choice demonstrators. State police separated the groups, then stayed between them throughout the protest. `` This is not a women's issue,'' actor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Busfield </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething,'' told the pro-choice rally. `` It's a family issue. It's a human rights issue.'' Elsewhere, rallies were held in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, Ind.; and at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> in the culmination of an on-campus vigil that went on for days. And about 800 backers of legalized abortion marched in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` This is a monumental day of reckoning for women's lives in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Coalition Opposing Operation Rescue. Operation Rescue, which has mounted a series of major anti-abortion protests aimed at blocking access to abortion clinics, is planning protests in 65 cities Friday and Saturday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Magera </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. She said the group would work for a `` human life amendment'' to the Constitution, and would seek bans on abortion in individual states in the event the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturns <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> Many speakers across the country spoke of the possibility that the high court could return decision-making authority on the legality of abortions to the states. `` It will be total chaos, either way,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, the president of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> legislature already has a bill that declares abortion centers public nuisances in the event the high court overturns <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Maintenance Treatment Prevents Ulcer Recurrence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Taking ulcer medicine continuously, not just during ulcer flare-ups, can help keep the painful irritations from returning, a study published today says. Doctors frequently prescribe the drugs ranitidine and cimetidine to ulcer sufferers. While these medicines can heal digestive ulcers within a month or two, they usually come back. In the study, conducted on people with duodenal ulcers, doctors showed that regular maintenance therapy with ranitidine cut the chances of ulcers returning almost in half. Patients who drank alcohol, smoked, had a history of ulcer disease or had duodenal scarring were at the greatest risk of recurrence, and they also benefited the most from regular doses of the drug. During a one-year period, ulcers returned in 37 percent of the people getting ranitidine and 63 percent given placebo pills. The study conducted on 140 people was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Deventer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 A strong earthquake centered in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> ocean shook islands south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> early today but no injuries or damage were reported, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said the quake, centered about 50 miles under the seabed and 420 miles south of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, registered 6.4 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. It said there was no danger of tsunami, or tidal waves. An agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that on the nearest inhabited island, <LOCATION> Chichi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jima </LOCATION>, the quake registered 2 on the Japanese scale of 7, meaning slight movement of sliding doors was noticeable. A tremor measuring two on the Japanese scale means extremely feeble shocks only felt by those at rest. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 6 is considered `` severe,'' capable of widespread damage near the epicenter. The Japanese scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a particular location and is not convertible to the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale.

 A man who used false resumes in a cross-country government career has been barred from taking a government job for seven years and sentenced to 90 days in jail for deceiving an Alaskan village. At his sentencing Wednesday, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 34, also was ordered to pay $ 18,000 restitution. He was convicted of first-degree theft stemming from his three-month tenure as city administrator of <LOCATION> Kake </LOCATION>, a tiny fishing and timber village in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. He pleaded no contest in February to the felony charge alleging he took $ 28,680 in salary, benefits and expenses before he was fired in December. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> placed <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> on probation for seven years, ordered him not to accept any government jobs during that time, and told him to write letters of apology to <PERSON> Kake </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where he also briefly worked. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> had listed academic degrees he had n't received and jobs he had n't held on his resume, officials have said. District Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ells </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> charge of theft by deception will be dismissed at the request of the <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> prosecutor. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> sent the city $ 707 in restitution Tuesday, closing that case, <PERSON> Ells </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> restitution represented expense money <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> was paid in August during a six-day stint as city manager before he resigned amid allegations he faked his resume. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> already has served 60 days in jail and asked to have the 30 remaining days waived, saying he had been unable to find a job since he was released on bail. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, however, said 90 days was not a harsh sentence considering the crime. `` This is pretty reprehensible conduct,'' the judge said of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s employment record. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> apologized for his conduct. He said he obtained the jobs by lying so he could support his wife and four young daughters. `` What I did here was wrong,'' he said. `` I lied on my resume because I needed a job to feed my family, and instead of doing it the right way ... I took too many shortcuts.'' Outside the courthouse, however, he denied allegations that he obtained other jobs under false pretenses. Public defender <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Treiber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> was considering going to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to find employment. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> stays in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, it is unlikely he will be able to pay the entire amount -LRB- of restitution -RRB-, even in seven years,'' <PERSON> Treiber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kake </PERSON> residents became suspicous of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> shortly after he arrived to take the $ 44,000-a-year administrator's job in October. He bought a luxurious $ 66,000 double mobile home, rifles and 1,000 rounds of ammunition with city money, and refused to release his resume for public inspection. A police records check revealed the outstanding <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> warrant in December and he was arrested. Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states revealed that at least 19 of <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>'s jobs since 1980 were with city or county governments. Records and the interviews showed <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON> used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs. <PERSON> Keyser </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, previously was placed on a year's probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> The charge alleged he used false information to get hired as <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> police chief. He was fired after four months when the discrepancies in his resume were reported in the news media.

 Two women who received fertilized eggs in their fallopian tubes through a new non-surgical procedure have produced the nation's first births to result from that technique. The procedure involves guiding a tube through the cervix to the fallopian tube, where it deposits two or three fertilized eggs. It is called non-surgical <LOCATION> ZIFT </LOCATION>, for zygote intrafallopian transfer. Previously, the fertilized eggs were deposited through surgery and general anesthesia. The new non-surgical approach is less expensive and can be done more often to establish pregnancy, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Asch </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. One girl was born April 9 by normal delivery, according to a university spokeswoman. One girl was delivered by Caesarean section on April 12, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Genetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> IVF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The second girl was premature at 36 -LCB- weeks, but was pronounced healthy soon after birth, the institute said. The girl and her mother are doing well now, institute director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Asch </PERSON> said putting fertilized eggs in the fallopian tube, rather than in the uterus as is done with standard in-vitro fertilization, gives them a better environment for development. <LOCATION> ZIFT </LOCATION> is a variant of GIFT, or gamete intrafallopian transfer, in which unfertilized eggs and sperm are put into the fallopian tube to achieve fertilization there. <PERSON> Asch </PERSON> said <LOCATION> ZIFT </LOCATION> is preferable to GIFT if the prospective father shows a low sperm count or if the woman has proteins called antibodies that can attack the father's sperm. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> estimated that only about 20 percent to 30 percent of women who go to an in-vitro fertilization center are candidates for GIFT or <LOCATION> ZIFT </LOCATION>, because those procedures require that the fallopian tubes not be damaged. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assisted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he did not know of any previous American births from non-surgical ZIFT.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s comedic talent was her strongest show business suit, but behind the scenes, her gutsy, pioneering spirit helped the fledgling television industry come of age. Miss Ball, who died Wednesday at 77, helped to develop that enduring TV staple, the situation comedy, and with her former husband, the late <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, established one of television's first major independent studios. Desilu, as the famed production house was called, became one of the most powerful forces in early television. Besides the `` I Love Lucy'' series, it turned out some of the top comedy shows of the 1950s and 60s, including `` December Bride,'' `` Our Miss <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>'' and `` Make Room for Daddy.'' Desilu, which had taken over <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, also produced successful action-adventure programs such as `` Star Trek'' and `` Mission: Impossible.'' As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> signed an $ 8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely touched today. In 1951, when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> decided to move Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s radio series, `` My Favorite Husband,'' to television, the network also wanted to move the show from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the young TV industry was based. But Miss Ball wanted to remain on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and she got her way. The solution was to use Hollywood's motion picture facilities and film the `` I Love Lucy'' episodes for later broadcast _ a bold decision that changed the face of television in the days before videotape. The show was filmed like a stage play before an audience, employing three cameras instead of the one camera traditionally used for motion pictures. This eliminated the need to interrupt dialogue to shoot from different angles and made the presence of a comedy enhancing audience feasible. The technique still is used today. Miss Ball needed an audience to be funny, recalled <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for programming in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> at the time. `` When she started the television show I insisted that she have an audience,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was a great clown, but she could only work successfully in front of people.'' The multiple-camera filming produced another dividend. `` I Love Lucy'' episodes were resalable as reruns and Desilu was the first studio to profit from program syndication. The various <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> series continue to be seen in more than 80 countries. Miss Ball and <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> divorced in 1960, and he sold the actress his share in the company for $ 3 million. With a shrewd business sense, Miss Ball built it into a major TV production company and in 1967 sold it to <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 17 million. The couple stopped making weekly `` I Love Lucy'' shows in 1957 in favor of monthly hourlong specials. In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, who became her executive producer, and she remained on television for another 12 years in the weekly `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'' and `` The Lucy Show.'' `` The biggest gamble she took was when she went on without <PERSON> Desi </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, then head of programming for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. `` The whole program staff was 50-50 whether she would be successful, let alone as successful as she had been with <PERSON> Desi </PERSON>. There was absolute amazement when she became just as big a star as before. In her career, that had to be her biggest challenge.'' `` I Love Lucy'' transcended other domestic comedies not only due to technical innovations, but also because it successfully mixed art and life, such as writing Miss Ball's pregnancy into the series _ a TV first _ or celebrating actual birthdays on camera. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said Wednesday that Miss Ball would always remain the network's first lady. `` <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s extraordinary ability to light up the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last forever,'' he said. `` Her loss is a loss to us all.''

 Leave it to <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> to find laughs _ hysterical, sidesplitting laughs _ in chocolates and grapes. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGillicuddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON>, and later <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, could get into more trouble than anybody on television. Sometimes actress <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> had the help of co-conspirator <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. But she always left <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> sputtering in broken English. Her then-husband, the late <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, was her first foil on `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' Later, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> was on the receiving end on `` The Lucy Show'' and `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' In the very first show, which went on the air on Oct. 15, 1951, the <ORGANIZATION> Ricardos </ORGANIZATION> decide to make out wills. And <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> is going to kill her. `` I Love Lucy'' got ratings that would make even <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> envious. The ratings were in the 50s. The birth of Little <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> on Jan. 19, 1953, got a rating of 71.8 and was seen by 92 percent of the television audience. Many of the shows involved <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s attempts to break into show business. Husband <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> was band leader at the <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s grape-stomping episode is one of her funniest and most memorable. It came during the fifth season, in 1956, when the <ORGANIZATION> Ricardos </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mertzes </ORGANIZATION> were on a visit to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Information on individual episodes is from `` The ` I Love Lucy' Book'' by <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, published by <PERSON> Doubleday-Dolphin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> is cast by an Italian director in a movie called `` Bitter Grapes.'' Assuming it's about wine-making, she dresses up as a peasant girl carrying a bunch of grapes and soon ends up in a grape-filled vat at a local winery. She stomps on the grapes to make wine and is soon in a grape fight with another woman grape stomper. She's in no shape to play her movie role, which turns out to be that of a typical American tourist. The role goes to <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>. In 1952, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> take a job in a candy factory when <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> tells <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> she needs to mend her spendthrift ways. The wives will go to work and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> will do the housework. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> works in the chocolate-dipping section, where, of course, she ends up in a chocolate fight with a fellow worker. She and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> are sent to the wrapping department and are unable to keep up with the assembly line. Another favorite episode came in 1955, when <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> was a guest and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> dressed up like the silent <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON>. The funniest part and the best remembered came when the <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON> and his lookalike meet and re-create the famous mirror routine from the <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Duck Soup.'' When <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> tried to emulate pioneer women in the first season, they made the usual mess. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>'s bread-making effort turned into a gigantic loaf that nearly filled up the kitchen when she put in too many cakes of yeast. Her television commercial for a health tonic left her tipsy in 1952. She had to keep drinking the tonic for the commercial and eventually its 23 percent alcohol content took its toll. Her speech became more and more slurred and the show got funnier and funnier. The birth of Little <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, which rivaled <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s inauguration as president on the front pages of the nation's newspapers, was seen by more people than any other TV episode at its time. The birth of <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was announced at the end of the show. In the show, filmed two months earlier, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> rushes <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> to the hospital, but has to get to the nightclub for his act. He gets into his voodoo doctor makeup at the hospital, then rushes to the <LOCATION> Tropicana </LOCATION>. He comes back for his first look at <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

The <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, man was among 17 Americans and one Canadian recognized Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A $ 2,500 grant was awarded to each hero or their survivors. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a business manager for <ORGANIZATION> E.M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, his family's oil business, said he had just walked out onto the company's river dock in <LOCATION> Calvert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on Jan. 23, 1988, when a group of frightened men told him 20-year-old <PERSON> Rockey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> had fallen into the river. Heavy clothing meant to protect dock workers from cold weather was pulling <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> further into the 38-degree water, and a 7 to 10 mph current was moving him toward <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> stripped, grabbed a two-foot piece of plastic wrapping on the ground and swam about 150 feet to <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Konosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, an inventor who founded of <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest manufacturers of consumer electronics, died of pneumonia today, a hospital official said. He was 94. <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> had been in poor health and was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> on April 5 for treatment of a cold, a company official said. Quitting school at age 10 to go to work, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> remained faithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest of nine children in <LOCATION> Wakayama </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He built his global electronics empire from an electric socket business he began in 1918. The company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries, with brands including <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION>, National, Quasar and <ORGANIZATION> Technics </ORGANIZATION>. Sales totaled $ 30.3 billion in the fiscal year ending in March. `` I have many memories of him,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said today. `` He was like a god.'' `` I have simply done common things commonly well, doing what I should do and abstaining from what I should not,'' <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> once wrote. `` In short, I have lived my daily life at the dictates of common sense.'' Later in life, he espoused a philosophy of `` peace and happiness through prosperity,'' a kind of benevolent capitalism he preached through his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with a circulation of 1.5 million. His views were criticized, however, as being a religion of worldly interests. Born Nov. 27, 1894, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> grew up in a well-to-do environment but was forced to quit school and work after his father, a farmer, lost the family fortune speculating in rice futures. After apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoal-burning stoves and a bicycle maker, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> began working for the <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1910. He stayed there seven years, until he quit to begin his electric socket business with his wife, <PERSON> Mumeno </PERSON>, and her brother. As an inventor, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> registered more than 100 patents. His first was for a successful two-way socket he invented while confined to home because of poor health. Centering around consumer appliances, his Osaka-based company's products ranged from television sets, washing machines and refrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> was known in the business world for his unconventional ideas, such as turning assembly line workers into door-to-door salesmen during a 1974 recession, and once advocating that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> bulldoze 20 percent of its mountains to provide reclaimed land for the crowded nation. He received honorary degrees from several of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most prestigious universities, and, in 1979 started his own school of government and business. He wrote more than 50 books, including a 1975 best-seller titled `` How to Rescue Crumbling <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' and received one of the Japanese government's highest honors, the Order of the Rising Sun First Class, as well as medals and honors from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Mumeno </PERSON>, 93, and daughter, <PERSON> Sachiko </PERSON>, 68. The daughter's husband, <PERSON> Masaharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>, 76, was adopted into the family and now is the company chairman. A Matsushita official said funeral services would be held Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Honganji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsumura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Betsuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 A woman who believed her children were clones was charged with decapitating the two baby girls, according to authorities. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 37, told authorities she had to kill the children to get her real babies back, according to a complaint sworn out against her. She pleaded innocent by reason of mental illness to two counts of first-degree murder on Wednesday and was ordered to the state hospital in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION> to undergo psychiatric testing. Sheriff's deputies on Monday found the bodies of 15-month-old <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and 4-month-old <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> in a mobile home south of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, which is in the northeast part of the state. The deputies were summoned to the trailer Monday evening by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, the girls' father. <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> told the deputies that a homicide had been committed in his mobile home. Asked how he knew, <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> replied, `` I saw my daughter's head in a plastic bag.'' <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> told deputies that <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> had said that `` Medussa had made her do it.'' At the mobile home the deputies confronted <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who told them she had received a telephone call from a woman who told her she `` would have to kill the look-alike chidren'' if she wanted her real children back, said Investigator <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenary </PERSON> in a complaint sworn out against <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. `` The defendant further stated ... that she needed to cut the look-alikes' arms and heads off and put them in different places so that her children may be brought back in two days,'' <PERSON> Trenary </PERSON> said. Deputies found the children's bodies in plastic bags hidden in a closet and beneath a crib. The complaint said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> admitted committing the killings with a large butcher knife. Sheriff <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Oedekoven </PERSON> said the woman has several aliases and that <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> may not be her legal name.

<HEAD>Doubts Linger on Cold Fusion As Experiment Published</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Today's publication of one of the first reports of so-called cold fusion has met with continuing skepticism about the technology's potential to provide a major new energy source. `` It sounds like there's a real reaction which is very slow and very curious, but it's more of a curiosity than anything else,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>, an electrical engineering professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The amount of energy produced is so small that while it may someday be appropriate for small-scale applications, such as satellites, it probably could not be useful for power plants, he said. Still, he called the report in today's issue of the British journal Nature `` about the only reasonably scientific paper that I've seen'' on cold fusion. The research was done by a team led by physicist <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had already publicly described the experiments, which found evidence of fusion occurring in relatively simple equipment at room temperature. Fusion is the process that powers the sun. It occurs when the core, or nucleus, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the core of another, releasing energy. Some scientists believe fusion, if harnessed, could provide an environmentally attractive source of energy. In contrast to cold fusion, conventional fusion research uses very high temperatures and complex machinery. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists caused a sensation last month when they announced that their cold fusion apparatus produced more energy than it consumed. In contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has said his experiments produced only a very tiny fraction of the energy they consumed. Still, he and colleagues from <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> write in the Nature paper, the phenomenon `` opens the possibility, at least, of a new path to fusion energy.'' They used a series of small jars, each holding about four teaspoons of a mix of metallic salts and heavy water, in which hydrogen is replaced with a chemical cousin called deuterium. Researchers applied three to 25 volts to the solution between an electrode made of gold foil and another made of either titanium or palladium. The current herded deuterium atoms into the latter electrode, where they apparently fused, researchers said. The scientists reported that the apparatus produced a `` small but significant'' emission of neutrons, which are extremely tiny particles that are given off in fusion reactions. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Argonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, one of the experts Nature asked to review the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> paper, said he has doubts that fusion occurred to the extent the paper suggests. `` I take it as a certainty that cold fusion goes on at some low level, but it's problematic as to whether it's at an observable level. That remains to be shown in a tight case,'' he said in an interview. More experiments must be done with additional procedures to rule out other explanations for the results, such as interference from cosmic rays, he said.

 Republican faithful, shaken by election losses in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> earlier this year, saw <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopeful <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> win a surprisingly easy victory to fill <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s only seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a state representative, defeated Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> in Wednesday's special election by more than 13,000 votes. Even <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 56, was amazed by the victory margin in the race for the seat relinquished by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` I thought it would be close, for no other reason than, of course, our campaign started 40 days ago, or less, and the other campaign has been going off and on for nearly a year-and-a-half,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Unofficial returns showed him with 74,258 votes, or 52 percent, to <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s 60,821 votes, or 43 percent. Independent <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> received 5,921 votes, while <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an independent who espoused white separatist views, got 500. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> credited his victory to the voters' desire to maintain a conservative approach in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think largely it was an expression of continuation of the splendid job that's been done by <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And a voice for continued representation in that mode, of a conservative voice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, a state senator, had won the Democratic nomination for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat after a 13-month campaign that ended with his losing to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> by just 1,322 votes last November. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s widespread name recognition was a decided plus for the Democrat, but in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign the Republicans constantly referred to him as a free-spending liberal beholden to out-of-state labor groups. Indeed, labor groups contributed more than 80 percent of <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s campaign funds. But the Democrat denounced the Republican charges and countered by portraying <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> as a pawn of the national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, which appeared desperate for a victory after losing special congressional elections in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>, 38, ran behind as the returns came in and never recovered, winning just four of the state's 23 counties. In an interview from his home, <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> blamed the loss on voters who stayed home. `` Close to 60,000 voters that did n't vote in this election ... voted last November. That's where the difference was,'' he said. `` We just did n't get all the voters out that we hoped would have voted.''

 Federal scientists will monitor the operation of a cold fusion experiment in an attempt to verify that <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researchers have captured the power of the sun in a test tube. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> testified Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will visit his campus to watch the operation of a tabletop fusion cell. Later, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> told the committee, the cell will be dismantled and taken back to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> by the federal scientists. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his collaborator, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, arranged for the demonstration in an effort to calm skepticism in the science community that the room-temperature fusion apparatus actually works. Testimony by <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> was followed by comments from seven scientists at other university and federal laboratories who told of great doubts among researchers about the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> results. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltmarsh </PERSON>, head of the fusion energy program at the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said all of the federal laboratories had tried to replicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> cold fusion results. `` The results have all been negative,'' said <PERSON> Saltmarsh </PERSON>. `` We have seen no heat'' generated by the process. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegation before the committee also included <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who urged that the government move swiftly to provide federal funds for the cold fusion research. Other scientists who testified, however, cautioned against federal support until the process has been verified. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> received a generally warm reception by the science committee, but did face some sharp questioning about why so many other laboratories have not been able to verify their experiment. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' announcement of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> participation came after Rep. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, R-Wash., asked if the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment could be performed before independent observers `` We have 19 experiments being set up now,'' said <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>. One of these, he said, will be monitored by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION> scientists. Committee members also asked why some other laboratories have not been able to get details needed to replicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment, and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> replied: `` We are very happy to tell people how we have been able to do it.'' He said, however, that those who do n't succeed should `` publish in full'' reports of their failures. Two researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> reported a successful experiment on Monday in which results of the cold fusion experiment were duplicated using specifications and materials described in an article by <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. Physics professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> and graduate student <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said `` at least'' 100 times more energy was produced than was used to start the experiment, with the energy burst occurring in the first second. Rep. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, D-Tenn., noted at Monday's hearing that reports of the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment have indicated the heat produced is at a low level She asked if they could achieve a `` useful temperature'' with the reaction. `` We've had a cell warm up to the boiling point,'' said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. But he said to scale up to a useful level `` raises many new problems.'' `` We think it's feasible, but it will require a very high effort,'' he said. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> spent about $ 100,000 of their own money to develop the tabletop fusion cell, but they said to scale up to a larger size will cost about 10 times more, and to produce useful energy `` would cost millions.'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> urged the committee to provide federal funds to help set up a fusion research center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. He said the state already has allocated $ 5 million and another $ 1 million has been raised from private sources. `` What level of funding do you believe is needed?'' asked Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>. `` The figure that comes to mind is $ 25 million,'' said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> `` We should move promptly. We should have proposals within a week.'' Other scientists who testified, however, urged the committee not rush into support of the effort. `` We need at least two months to evaluate the significance of this process,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fusion researcher. Fusion research could be hurt if federal money were put into the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> effort before it is proven, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miley </PERSON>, a fusion expert from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Urbana </LOCATION>. `` A failure could set fusion research back by years,'' he said. `` I urge us to not overreact and put all our eggs in one basket.''

<HEAD>King Hussein Names Former Army Commander Prime Minister</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> today named close friend and former army commander Field Marshal <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> to head a new government, official sources reported. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> was shaken last week by riots over price increases. The new Cabinet will act as a caretaker until the country can organize its first general parliamentary elections in 22 years, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in an interview published today with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah. `` The next government will be a temporary one with a specific assignment, namely speeding up solutions to our problems ... and overseeing the general elections which will take place very soon,'' the king was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, 55, was commander in chief of the armed forces until last year, when the king brought him to the palace as chief of the royal court and adviser on security affairs. He is best known outside <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as the architect of the army's 1970-1971 war to crush <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas who had threatened the stability of the state The bloodiness of that conflict earned him lasting hostility on the part of many Palestinians, but respect from native Jordanians who resented the guerrillas' actions in their country. The rioting over price rises last week was <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s worst domestic violence since 1971. At least nine people died and government property was smashed in dozens of southern Jordanian towns and villages. The unrest occurred almost wholly among disgruntled native Jordanians in the south, the wellspring of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s support. The rioters shouted backing for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, but chanted for the ouster of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, who was blamed for economic difficulties that cut per capita income to about $ 1,200 a year from $ 2,000 in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> resigned with his cabinet on Monday after four years in office _ the longest single term by any premier since <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> gained independence in 1946. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> is very distantly related to the king because both are members of the <PERSON> Hashemite </PERSON> family descended from <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. His father, <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON>, came north from the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Emir </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, the founder of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and served as <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>'s closest adviser for many years. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Victoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sandhurst </LOCATION> military academy. He joined the army in 1953, the year <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> came to power, and was by the young king's side when <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> drove out to meet his troops and rally them against a coup d'etat attempt in 1957. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> commanded an armored brigade in the 1967 war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and his reported hostility to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas led the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to demand his dismissal as assistant chief of army operations in early 1970. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> complied in a brief attempt to placate the fedayeen guerrillas, but restored <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>'s position on the eve of the army's Black September war against the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The official army history describes him as `` the principle architect of the operational plan for neutralization of the fedayeen'' in 1970 and 1971. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a televised address Wednesday night that elections would be held soon. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> last held general elections for parliament in 1967, just before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which contributed half of the deputies to the old 60-member parliament. The king suspended that body last year when he severed links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The government recently announced plans for a new parliament with 72 members elected wholly from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> itself.

 Three Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> today from the Mir space station, leaving no one aboard the orbiting craft until at least August, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. This is only the second time the space station has been left unattended since it was launched in February 1986. Mir was unmanned from July 1986 to February 1987 while the Soviets prepared the station for constant occupation. Officials said leaving the Mir unmanned will save money at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> faces a $ 160 billion budget deficit and will give experts a chance to review scientific data already collected. Meanwhile, other segments of the Soviet space program are continuing. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced today that a Photon rocket had been launched Wednesday. `` The program of the 16-day flight includes experiments to produce semiconductor materials with improved qualities and extra-pure biologically active preparations in micro-gravity,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soyuz TM-7 carrying the three cosmonauts from the Mir touched down in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at 6:59 a.m., <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The capsule carrying <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> landed 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dzheskazgan </LOCATION>. The cosmonauts, apparently suffering no ill-effects from their extended space flight, were to be taken by helicopter to a nearby town to meet with their families, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> had been in space for five months while <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, who remained on board after orbiting with a Soviet-Afghan team, had been aboard Mir for eight months. A replacement crew was originally due to arrive at the Mir on April 19, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` a delay with the preparation'' of two new modules forced a change in plans. The next crew due to take up residence in Mir in mid-August will bring with it two modules containing a space chicken farm and equipment for the production of single-crystal semiconductor materials, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said there would be `` a biological complex for mastering the technology of growing poultry in zero gravity.'' The new crew members, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON>, are expected to remain on board six months. One of the new modules will contain an airlock to permit cosmonauts to exit the craft while in orbit, and a maneuvering unit for spacewalks, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Deputy flight director <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Blagov </PERSON> said last week that the new modules, which would double the station's weight to 100 tons, would be attached to the Mir by the end of the year. He said they also will bring on board a space bicycle, a solar battery and an East German optical experiment. In September, an Afghan and a Soviet cosmonaut were forced to postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule for a day because of equipment and crew errors. They touched down safely a day late but were running dangerously low on food and air. In December, two Soviet cosmonauts returned from the Mir after breaking the record for the longest time in space after a year-long stay.

<HEAD>Police Clash With Strikers, Students In Four Cities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of striking workers and students fought police with firebombs and clubs in four cities today and dissidents vowed to go ahead with mass demonstrations this weekend despite a government ban. About 10,000 striking workers from 12 factories clashed with riot police in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> for a fourth straight day to demand the release of jailed strike leaders, police said. Workers swarmed into the streets, hurling firebombs and rocks at police, who fired volleys of tear gas and made shield charges. Another 3,000 strikers clashed with riot police in the nearby port of <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> after marching through the city. Protesters burned down an office of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Police officials, who declined to be named, said two riot troopers were seriously injured in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, but they had no further details on injuries. Radical students also clashed with riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. About 1,000 students battled police at <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chonam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after burning effigies of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The clashes came as dissidents vowed to proceed with plans for protests this weekend despite government warnings that police would block any protest. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance, said the government had no right to ban a major labor rally scheduled for Sunday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Alliance leaders said police would be responsible for any violence. `` We are ready to break down any police blockade if police use illegal means to block our peaceful rally,'' the alliance said in a statement. About 30 labor leaders were arrested today in police raids in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> as the government moved against radical labor groups, police said. Those arrested faced charges of staging illegal strikes, they said. Radical student groups, which have said they will support the labor rally, said they would go ahead with a march Friday from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to the North Korean border for talks with communist students on reuniting the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and taking part in an international youth festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in July. Police have banned the student march. Several attempts last year by radical students to march to the border triggered rioting in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities. The radical students have been staging almost daily violent campus protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. The radicals and allied dissident groups lack popular support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest and a wave of increasinlgy violent strikes for better pay and improved working conditions. Student and dissident groups are attempting to unite with workers to build an anti-government alliance. Top opposition leaders warned Wednesday that continued unrest could undermine democratic development in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Dissident leaders claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule and demand the former general step down. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won elections in December, 1987 after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.

<TEXT>
 Maybe, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was right. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> treasurer had ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at last summer's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, saying he had been `` born with a silver foot in his mouth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to her remark after he flubbed a line in his speech Wednesday to a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. `` You know, I've been thinking about it. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was right,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to appreciative laughter and applause. `` Look, I kept putting that silver foot in my mouth all along the way,'' he said. `` But the bottom line is, when they ask, ` Where's <PERSON> George </PERSON>?' _ say he's in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, among friends, and very proud to be back.'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who had a front-row seat for the president's address, wore the foot-shaped silver pin that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> previously sent her `` I thought it was appropriate that I wear it today. When a gentleman sends you jewelry and he comes to town, well, you want to be sure and wear it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> devoted much of his address to reminiscences about his 1948 move to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and his deep affection for the state. Raised in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and owner of a home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took some ribbing from Democrats during the 1988 campaign over his claim to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where his address now is a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel. `` Let me just say a few words about what it means to be a Texan. My credentials,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I have my driver's license here. I have my <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hunting license here. And somewhere, my voter registration slip. `` And it is true, I like <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. But I am a Texan. I just want to clear the air and say a few words about that.'' Unlike Alamo hero <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, he did n't ride to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on a horse but in a red Studebaker. `` I'll admit it. I did n't know if a chicken fried steak was a chicken fried like a steak or a steak that tasted like a chicken. But I've learned,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker loaded with 22 million gallons of oil lost power and drifted for nearly seven hours before it was towed into harbor early today to undergo engine repairs, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The 810-foot Exxon <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> had drifted away from land, in an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep. Seas were calm and winds were mild. Coast Guard Petty Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said the ship arrived at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at about 1 a.m. today, under tow by a tugboat. Two other tugboats were dispatched and traveled alongside the tanker in case of problems, <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also sent ships and planes to monitor the situation and to be available in case of an emergency. <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said it may take a couple of days to repair the damage to the tanker's propulsion system. The single-hulled tanker was about nine miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flattery </LOCATION> and 12 miles west of the entrance to the Strait of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuca </PERSON> when a boiler tube failed about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, shutting down the propulsion system, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The crew of 20 never was in danger, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. The incident occurred about a month after the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground near <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, dumping 11.2 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, built in 1970, was inspected in a shipyard a month ago, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. The tanker left the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> early Sunday to deliver crude oil to a refinery in <LOCATION> Anacortes </LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. It carried 532,862 barrels of oil, or 22.38 million gallons, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders warned in a heated debate over their losses in balloting for a new legislature that the party is in danger of losing both its unity and its hold on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people. In response, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rebuked several officials, including non-voting Politburo member <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, for losing faith in his reform campaign. Statements of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members published today in the party newspaper Pravda revealed an unprecedented open dispute in the party's policy-making body about the party's political course. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the meeting of the committee during a closed-door session Tuesday that the election results were a victory because they showed the people back his reforms. The party can not afford to slow down or lose control of the reform process it started, he said. `` If we lose initiative, allow a lagging behind, serious if not irreparable damage will be done to the cause of restructuring with the resulting additional moral, social, political and economic confusion,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The debate took place in a meeting where the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accepted the resignations of 74 of its 301 members, most of whom through age, illness or political disgrace had lost the government or party job that entitled them to membership. The move strengthened <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s grip on the policy-making body. <PERSON> Solovyov </PERSON> was among at least three dozen senior party and government officials who went down to an embarrassing defeat in March 26 elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. It was the country's first contested vote in seven decades. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also criticized the <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party for a lack of openness and failing to push reforms hard enough. Perestroika _ the program <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> launched four years ago to overhaul the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> economy and society _ remains the proper course, he said, but reforms are not being properly enacted, particularly by local leaders. `` I think, comrades, and this is opinion of the entire Politburo _ that we can no longer put up with mismanagement that literally compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage _ economic and moral _ to the whole of society.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that in many areas the economy has deteriorated and food and housing shortages are increasing, in part because economic reforms were not fully thought out before implementation. He said many problems can be traced to wasteful government spending. `` The food problem is far from solved,'' the president said. `` The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing.'' People `` see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly demand a strict punishment of the culprits, not because of vengeance but to assert the realization that it is inadmissible and impossible to throw the people's resources to the winds,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The state's financial position is grave,'' the 58-year-old leader said. The budget deficit is expected to hit $ 162 billion this year, economists say. In one pointed attack, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> singled out those responsible for particular failures, such as importing millions of syringes with no needles. The construction industry `` has been shoveling billions of rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins.'' Building a factory to produce detergent is in its ninth year, while people face daily shortages of soap and detergent, he said. Individual workers share the blame, he said. `` Many forgot how to work. They got used to being paid often just for coming to work.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blamed poor agricultural production on `` the work level, initiative and responsibility of local leaders.'' He said the problem became especially acute after the central leadership began delegating some power and decision-making to the local level. When people turn to local bureaucrats for help, they encounter `` the old atmosphere, where every visitor is looked down upon as being very nearly persona non grata,'' he complained. `` This causes special resentment.'' In this week's housecleaning of the Soviet leadership, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> removed 110 senior officials. Many had already retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats on the committee or its financial arm. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said many leaders were caught in an `` inertia of old thinking ... One generation of party members has naturally to replace another. This process should be perceived as such.'' Observers said many of those retired were the so-called `` dead souls,'' holdovers from the era of the late <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also noted crime has risen as society has become more democratic, especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise. He pledged a thorough investigation of the April 9 clash in which 20 pro-independence demonstrators in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> were killed.

 Families of the 47 sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa should begin receiving benefits checks within a month, government officials say. All 47 crewmen carried the maximum of $ 50,000 in life insurance available under a military policy administered by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Veterans Affairs subcommittee on compensation, pensions and insurance. Those checks will be mailed by the end of May, he said. The sailors' dependents also will receive monthly benefits checks sent to the families of any service member killed while on duty, <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` They'll receive a lot of assistance here because this is an abnormal case,'' he said. Aside from the insurance payment and monthly benefits checks, the families will get six month's salary from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>. The military also will pay for funeral costs for the sailors who died when an explosion tore through a ship turret during a training exercise April 19. The families will receive medical coverage and educational benefits as well, <PERSON> Brizzi </PERSON> said. A private fund-raising drive sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> office also has received more than $ 35,000 in contributions.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers today shot and killed one Palestinian and wounded 32 in clashes in the occupied lands, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Also today, an aide said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will not offer an alternative to his election proposal for the occupied lands now that it has been rejected by prominent Palestinians there. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbieh </PERSON>, 20, of the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> died of a gunshot wound to the chest. Arab reporters said he was shot after troops trying to enter the camp opened fire to disperse several masked youths throwing stones and empty bottles. Twenty-six Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy hit in the left shoulder, were wounded by gunfire in a half-dozen clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and six Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army, which does not include victims treated for injuries and released, said only three Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. It had no information on the death or the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> clashes, spokesmen said. Palestinians observed a general strike to express solidarity with their brethren killed in the nearly 17-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. The strike came a day after three Palestinian youths were shot to death and about 60 wounded, most in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The deaths raised to 451 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died during the unrest. On Wednesday, 83 local Palestinians issued the first formal response to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan. They rejected the idea of balloting before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew its troops from occupied areas. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposal calls for elections to be held to select representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on an interim solution to the occupied lands. The aim of the talks would be to agree on an autonomy scheme for Palestinian self-rule in the occupied lands. Palestinians fear the temporary solution would become permanent. `` This is the best program we can suggest to them,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did n't view the rejection as final and would ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to press Palestinians to reconsider. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as telling an audience Wednesday night that his proposals were `` generous and logical'' and that Palestinians would be `` mistaken'' if they thought they could hold out for more later. In taped remarks from the same gathering broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` We have heard an announcement from some of our neighbors that they reject our proposals. I hope this is not their last word.'' The Palestinians insisted on an international peace conference with participation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, proposals <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has rejected. They did not rule out elections entirely but said balloting should be one step in a process toward an overall settlement that they want to end in statehood. In a leaflet distributed today, the clandestine PLO-backed Unified National Leadership of the Uprising turned down <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan `` Our people categorically reject the U.S.-backed plan and the attempts to market it to the Palestinians and the Arabs,'' it said. Underground leaders demanded in the leaflet that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states convene a summit to press for an international conference

<HEAD>Millionaire Tax-Evader's Homeless Study Presented in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study on the homeless that was funded by millionaire industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> as part of a criminal tax-evasion sentence was outlined in federal court. The 800-page study, including graphs, charts and other documents, was unveiled Wednesday and provided guidelines for changes in community action, funding and policy to ease the plight of the homeless in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The $ 267,000 study was meant as a guide for <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, who must recommend a spending plan for easing problems of the homeless as part of an innovative sentence that kept him out of jail in the tax case. Two probation officers sat through the proceedings to monitor <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s progress. Principal author <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fike </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> summarized 42 primary study points for a committee headed by former <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> administrator <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, who was appointed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> to oversee the $ 3 million fund <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> created. The $ 267,000 study was paid for out of the interest-bearing fund, which now has a balance of $ 3,015,000, said Sister <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which directed the effort. Sister <PERSON> O'Laughlin </PERSON> said she expected <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> would present his plan soon. `` I think he is ready now. He has it in his mind and I think he could do it within the week,'' she said. `` It is my impression that he wants it to be family-oriented.'' <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> pleaded no contest in September 1987 to evading $ 1.2 million in federal income taxes by overestimating the value of property in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> he donated to <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. At his sentencing last year, <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> on five years' probation on the condition that he pay all of his back taxes, penalites and interest, the cost of prosecution of his case and create the $ 3 million homeless fund. The penalty package totaled about $ 7.75 million _ more than six times the amount <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> was accused of defrauding from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Among the study's findings: homeless drug addicts and the mentally ill with severe disabilities would benefit from professional rehabilitation, more residential services were needed for homeless people with AIDS, prevention measures should be taken to keep female-headed families from becoming homeless, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lacks day-care centers for homeless children, and zoning and code enforcement rules could help people stay in their homes during rehabilitation and discourage deterioration of low-income housing.

 After people prayed for rain to relieve a drought, two tornadoes and heavy rains battered rural <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, killing at least 176 people and injuring hundreds, the state news agency said today. The agency, <PERSON> Bangladesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangbad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sangstha </PERSON>, did not cite a source for the death toll but gave the figure in a story that said President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> had ordered relief and rescue operations for victims of a tornado Wednesday night in the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area. An independent news agency, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION>, put the death toll at 42, citing reports from its correspondent in <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The tornado, with winds of 100 mph, hailstones, and drenching showers came hours after <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> ordered nationwide prayers for rain. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> alone, more than 75,000 people joined <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> in a prayer service. Two months of drought had threatened to destroy more than half the rice crop in this poverty-stricken nation. Agriculture officials said more rain would be needed in the coming week to save the crops. The government news agency said 22 bodies were found in the rubble of fallen mud and straw houses. The news agency did not give details. At least 200 of the injured were hospitalized, the government-owned newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Dainik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangla </ORGANIZATION> said. It said scores of people were missing after their boats capsized on the <LOCATION> Padma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Another tornado hit the <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION> district, 25 miles east of the capital, killing five people and injuring 500, the English-language New Nation said. The independent daily said about 200,000 people were affected by the tornadoes. The newspapers said thousands of mud-and-straw houses were swept away. The tornadoes snapped communications links between <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and much of the country. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita annual income of $ 160, alternates between flood and drought. Agriculture is the main occupation of the majority of the country's 110 million people

 Twenty bandits armed with pistols and machine guns raided a <ORGANIZATION> Colgate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> factory today and escaped with $ 740,000 worth of soap, toothpaste, bubble bath and shampoo, police and company officials said. The bandits, who arrived with a dozen trucks to transport their loot, burst into the factory in this seaside city 35 miles south of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> shortly after midnight, police said. The bandits locked about 80 workers in a company truck and at gunpoint forced another 20 workers to load up the gang's trucks with the toilet articles. The gang then forced the rest of the workers into the company truck and drove off, according to the police account. `` The bandits were calm and very professional. They looked through the lists of merchandise to decide what they wanted to steal,'' the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified company employee as saying. Police said the gang remained in the plant for about four hours. The workers freed themselves about a half hour later and called police.

<HEAD>American Publisher Pulls Out Of Tehran Book Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of two American publishing companies that planned to display books at a book fair in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> next month has withdrawn, citing questions about the fair's legitimacy. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> & amp; Sons, a major publisher of technical and scientific books, had agreed more than a year ago to be in the fair. It shipped books for display to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> soon afterward but had not intended to send anyone to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that because books already are in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> titles may be put on display, but the publisher was disassociating itself from the fair because of what it has learned recently. `` First, visas have not been granted by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to any members of the European community or to Americans to participate in the fair in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>,'' the publisher said in a statement Wednesday. `` Second, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is excluding the books of some publishers. Given these facts, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> should not be considered a participant in the fair,'' it said. The biennial fair May 7-19 is conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and generally concentrates on scientific, medical and technical books. <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION>, the other publisher planning to participate, will be there through its company in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` We do n't anticipate anyone going with the books,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` We have an independent sales agent who sells our books and those of other publishers. He's an Iranian national.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said about 50 publishers worldwide would participate in the fair. <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> were criticized by the Authors' Guild and by the publisher of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s books. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is the author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' a fictional work many Moslems have found offensive and that caused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, to issue a death threat against him. Guild President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said he was appalled that any Western publisher `` would deal with any organization in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as long as the death threat on <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is in place.'' Viking Penguin, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publisher, said in a statement it doubted `` anyone could fail to recognize the moral questions'' raised by participating. `` Obviously we deplore the death threat that was made,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> responded. `` But we do n't think censorship is the answer to that. Authors should be free to write and publishers free to distribute their books. Anything less than that is a blow to anyone's liberty. Philosophy and safety both figured in decisions of publishers to skip the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> fair, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>. He said the modest-sized fair would have been a low priority for most publishers anyway.

 Rebels attacked a Burmese town early today and killed at least seven people, according to reports from the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government and from people who said they fled the ambush. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> rebels fired rocket-propelled grenades into houses in the town of <LOCATION> Myawaddy </LOCATION> and shot at those who tried to escape their burning homes, said refugees who crossed the border into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. More than 180 houses and government buildings and 30 trucks were set ablaze during the 2 a.m. attack, and at least 16 people wounded, the refugees said. In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told a news conference the town was attacked by 150 rebels. He said two policemen and five civilians were killed and nine others, including four soldiers, were injured. The refugees said 12 people died and that all were Burmese except for one Thai who was visiting the town, just across the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> border. Thai officials said 14 Burmese were sent to the Mae Sot hospital, eight in serious condition. Two Thais also were injured. The Karens withdrew from <LOCATION> Myawaddy </LOCATION> after 3 a.m. but continued firing to prevent residents from putting out the fires, the refugees said. They said guerrillas came from two nearby Karen camps and attacked while most of the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government soldiers normally occupying the town were away. The Karens have been sporadically attacking <LOCATION> Myawaddy </LOCATION>, 165 miles east of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, since February. <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials say the attacks are retaliation for government assaults on <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> bases. Government forces have captured two major <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> strongholds along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border _ <LOCATION> Maela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Poh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kay </LOCATION> _ in the past month.

<TEXT>
 The jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial resumed deliberating his fate today on 12 criminal charges as it entered its sixth day plowing through 363 exhibits totaling some 1,300 pages. The office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Wednesday that all of the jurors were bearing up well, following earlier health problems reported by several members. Since Monday, when juror <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> complained of high blood pressure problems, courthouse nurses have made regular visits to the jury. They also gave non-prescription medicines to two jurors who complained of chest colds. The trial, almost 3 months old, produced 187 government and 176 defense exhibits that are in the courtroom with the jurors as they consider the charges. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. He also is accused of illegally converting traveler's checks from a Contra leader to his personal use, accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. On seven of those counts, if <PERSON> North </PERSON> is found innocent, the jury also must decide whether or not he is guilty of aiding and abetting in the activity, another felony. Nine of the charges carry maximum penalties of five years in prison and fines of $ 250,000 each. The other charges have maximum penalties each of 10 years, 3 years and 2 years, along with $ 250,000 fines _ a total of 60 years and fines of $ 3 million as a maximum if he is convicted on all counts. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a federal appeals court order that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> conduct a further hearing on a motion by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and nine other news organizations to inspect a sealed trial exhibit. The exhibit is a stipulation summarizing top secret intercepts by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> concerning a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North's lawyers used the stipulation in an attempt to show the jury that top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials knew at the time of the plane's cargo. North's defense of one of the charges against him is that his superiors knew <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> were aboard the flight, but tried to cover up by saying that no one at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> knew until January 1986 that the missiles had been shipped. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants a further hearing to `` afford the government the opportunity to establish a basis for denying the press the access it now seeks'' to the document that was shown only to jurors, the department said. Alternatively, the government asked for 14 days in which to file a brief with the appeals court responding to the news organizations' motion. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> noted that it could have contested the relevancy of the stipulation under the Classified Information Procedures Act. `` To minimize the disruption of the proceedings at the final stages of the case, however, it agreed to the less time-consuming alternative of permitting the -LRB- unedited -RRB- stipulation to go to the jury with the understanding that it would not be subsequently disclosed,'' the department said.

 Presidents who do n't use the media, especially television, to build a relationship with the electorate will find themselves without a base when a crisis develops, said a panel discussing `` The Presidency in the'90s.'' `` Presidents win support in these times not because the public agrees with them on their ideology or their policies or on substantive issues, but because they come to like them over television,'' <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, White House correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said at the <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> seminar Wednesday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was able to weather the crises of his tenure because of his personal popularity. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became adored by the public because the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> manipulated very brilliantly'' the media with staged events and photo opportunities, she said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not done that, she said, adding, `` I kind of respect it, but it's not doing him any good.'' Other panelists said, however, that media manipulation is worthless if the president or candidate has nothing substantive to say. `` That is equally as important in politics if not more important,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergen </PERSON>, an editor at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News and World Report. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does not attract followers because he's got media people. He's got something to say.'' The point was echoed at an earlier seminar Wednesday on the presidential selection process. `` Every time a candidate breaks through the puerility of the debate, whether it's <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his ` working poor' litany or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s acceptance speech -LRB- at the Republican convention -RRB-, you can feel the public almost come alive, say, ` More, please give us more,''' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, political and media adviser for ABC News. <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> also defended political advertising as admittedly `` a short and clumsy way to get to know a candidate. Yet even within those limits, you pick up something.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s media adviser, defended the advertising he crafted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last year against charges that it was too negative or unfair. `` Look at ` trash TV,' look at the lines blurring between tabloid journalism and journalism, look at the garbage that is out there in general,'' <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> said. `` I would submit that the political campaigns are among the cleanest things on television today.'' But NBC News commentator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON>, who moderated the seminar, said that since presidential candidates are spending public money _ about $ 41 million each in 1988 _ `` we ought to have some say in how they spend it.'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, an expert on presidential politics from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, suggested a nonpartisan panel be instituted to review political advertising and rule on its fairness and accuracy. Negative campaigning was one of the factors that turn people off and keep them away from the polls on Election Day, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> said he believed the role of television was exaggerated. `` You run the 1988 campaign with 10 percent unemployment and you have a very different result,'' he said. The five seminars Wednesday and today at <LOCATION> Fordham </LOCATION> were organized as part of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s commemoration of the bicentennial of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s presidential inauguration.

 More than 150,000 students and supporters of their pro-democracy campaign burst past a police line today and triumphantly filled <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, defying communist leaders' threat of a crackdown `` We have created history today. History will not forget us. The people will not forget us,'' a student leader shouted through a megaphone to students in the 100-acre square, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s symbolic seat of power. Trucks filled with soldiers circled the square to act as a barricade, but marchers swarmed onto the trucks. They shouted `` Welcome 38th Army!'' and handed out leaflets to soldiers explaining their demands for sweepings changes in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s autocratic system, including press freedom and accountability of the country's leaders The trucks were immobilized by the mob, and within minutes the vast square was turned into a sea of waving white-and-red student banners and protesters chanted pro-reform slogans. The students did not try to occupy the square but continued their march down <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, the capital's main thoroughfare. They then headed back to their campuses, declaring they had scored a victory by reaching the square. While the march was going on, the government partially acceded to the students' demand for dialogue, saying it was ready to hold talks with them `` at any time.'' But the statement said talks would have to be conducted through official student organizations, which the protesters have rejected. The evening television news carried lengthy official comments reiterating the government's pre-march statements condemning student-generated `` turmoil.'' `` The broad masses of students ... want to promote democracy and end corruption. That we understand and are in agreement with,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> city government said. `` But a minority of people ... reject the leadership of the party and government and want to return our country to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.'' The 1966-76 Cultural Revolution was a leftist campaign that turned into near civil war. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government on Wednesday issued stern warnings that the student protests, now in their 11th day, are illegal and further street demonstrations would be crushed. But students and a growing hoard of supporters pushed their way through police barriers across half a dozen intersections along the nine-mile route from campuses in northwest <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to the center of the city. When three truckloads of armed police pulled up at one intersection, they were surrounded by a crowd shouting `` People love the people's police, the people's police love people.'' By the time the students reached the square, more than eight hours after the march began, they were far outnumbered by workers and residents had who joined them, and the soldiers who had been guarding the square faded out of sight. Thousands of people leaned out windows and cheered as the marchers surged by. Kindergarten children stood at the gate of their school and applauded, and patients wearing bathrobes emerged from a hospital to accept pamphlets the students were handing out. Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted `` Long live democracy.'' Others shouted `` Down with bureaucracy, down with corruption,'' oft-repeated phrases during the demonstrations and class boycotts that have shaken the communist government. Student leaders called on students from dozens of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities to march to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to protest harsh government statements condemning their campaign for democracy. The government has accused the student activists of a `` planned conspiracy'' to overthrow the government. The students have called for Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to resign and say senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, is too old to rule. But most say their campaign is not anti-government. They have appealed for free speech and press, an end to rampant corruption in government and more funding for education. `` Strongly support the good leaders of the party,'' read one banner. The demonstrations were sparked by the April 15 death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a reformer. The demonstrations have been much larger, and gained far more popular support, than pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87 that led to Hu being ousted for failing to crack down on the students.

<TEXT>
 Negotiations on a global chemical weapons ban recessed today with delegates reporting a positive atmosphere but no progress on major issues holding up completion of a draft treaty. French envoy <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Morel </PERSON>, who chaired the talks, said results at the latest 15-week session `` may appear as falling short of the ambitions'' set by the 149-nation conference on chemical weapons in January. That <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting called on negotiators to redouble efforts to finish their work, which dates back to 1968. <PERSON> Morel </PERSON> suggested in a written progress report that `` real and intensive negotiations'' have yet to begin at the chemical arms talks in the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament. He said `` actual progress'' would be sought when the conference reconvenes in June. <PERSON> Morel </PERSON> said more than 18 countries have carried out trial inspections of their national chemical industries, a move aimed at helping negotiators design ways to police a future ban. But disagreement persisted, as in past years, on precisely these provisions for monitoring compliance and on several other issues, East German delegate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietze </PERSON> told the closing meeting of the conference's spring session. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and three Soviet bloc countries have submitted reports on national inspections to the conference, while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are among those expected to report at the next session, <PERSON> Morel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Morel </PERSON>'s report showed that one problem facing negotiators is that poison gas can easily be produced with readily available chemicals in plants not specially designed for the purpose. Some Western experts have said total monitoring of a chemical weapons treaty is not feasible. Negotiators are seeking to complete a global convention banning the production, use and stockpiling of chemical arms. The talks are the priority agenda item at the disarmament conference, the world's only multilateral arms negotiating forum

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, noting he is the first American vice president born after World War II, celebrated with Australians today the allied effort 47 years ago to beat back Japanese forces advancing toward this nation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on a five-day visit to this island nation to commemorate Australian-American Friendship Week, said the two countries must dedicate their relationship `` to keeping peace in this region.'' At a black-tie dinner, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 42, discussed the spirit of cooperation that took place in May 1942 when American and Australian naval forces turned back the Japanese at the Battle of the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the northeast coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The vice president, who arrived here from <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, read a proclamation from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that said the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> `` has thrived in peace because of our mutual respect, shared ideals and coordinated strides toward a more secure and prosperous world.'' Earlier today, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> facility deep in the Australian bush and called the resignations of several top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials a problem the administration must confront. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on his second day in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on his trip to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, visited the Tidbinbilla Space Tracking Station, which is managed by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s space office on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. The station where three giant satellite dishes keep tabs on satellites will track the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> satellite that is to be carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis on Friday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> earlier met with Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> and his top Cabinet officials. In a speech after those meetings, he praised the U.S.-Australia alliance and called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to take concrete steps to lessen military tensions in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. During his visit to the space tracking station, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> placed a telephone call to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>, an astronaut stationed at the Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. `` How are you doing ... Any good?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> as the two chatted about the upcoming Atlantis launch. `` We hope and pray everything goes well,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has recently taken a keen interest in space policy as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about the recent resignations of six top <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, including <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, head of the space station project, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` It was an interesting problem.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials cited low pay and potentially tougher ethics legislation the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider. Some of the rules are aimed at tightening the `` revolving door'' for federal workers, which would close job opportunities in the private sector for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` We'll just have to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and work within the administration to see if there is anything to adjust the regulations,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Higher pay for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers should also be considered, he said. Before leaving the space complex, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a former head of Tidbinbilla, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> award. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> after his speech there that economic frictions should not harm the strong alliance that has developed between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Our relationship with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is as strong as ever ... our alliance remains an essential part of the Western global and pacific regional collective security system,'' he said in the question-and-answer session. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said he hopes to hopes to see Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the leader of the Cambodian anti-communist resistance, in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> on his <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> trip.

 A black teen-ager whose tale of abduction and sexual assault by a group of white men led to months of legal commotion reportedly told a friend that she and her mother made up the story. <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> told the friend that she and her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, invented the story to keep the mother's live-in boyfriend from beating Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> denied the friend's report, the newspaper said. She was 15 when found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic bag, smeared with dog excrement and racial epithets. She said she had been abducted and raped over four days by five or six white men, at least one with a badge. Hospital tests did not show signs of rape, and witnesses later said they saw her at a party during the four-day period. Activist lawyers <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> advised <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family not to cooperate with a grand jury or investigators, claiming white officials were engaged in a racist cover-up. The grand jury concluded last fall after a seven-month investigation that the charges were untrue and that her condition when found was not inconsistent with `` having been self-inflicted.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor in the case, told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s tale was consistent with the grand jury's findings. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who began dating Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> in the fall of 1987, told the newspaper that within the last two weeks Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> told him what happened during the time she was supposedly missing.

<HEAD>Report Cites Lack of Security At A Moscow Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Security is so lax at one of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s major airports that people have walked onto the runways and asked pilots to fly them to distant points for cash, a newspaper reported today. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> regional newspaper, <LOCATION> Leninskoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Znamya </LOCATION>, said people pass easily through checkpoints at Demodedovo airport, one of the capital's three major passenger terminals, without passports or tickets. In one case, a car drove onto the runway to unload luggage, the newspaper said. People treat <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> passenger aircraft like city taxis at the airport, the paper said. The airport primarily services domestic routes, but foreign dignitaries often land there, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plane arrived there when he came to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for last year's summit meeting In one case, `` a man walked between parked airplanes, then stopped and asked a pilot to take him to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>,'' 1,000 miles away, the newspaper said. It said he offered to pay cash, but he had no documents or tickets. `` At the same airport, a car drove right to the plane scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky </LOCATION> -LRB- on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast -RRB- started to unload heavy parcels, saying to an air hostess that the captain was aware of the load, which was a lie,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Leninskoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Znamya </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said the crunch of passengers at peak periods, particularly in the summer, made it impossible to check documents and passports properly. `` A person with someone else's passport can board a plane,'' the newspaper said. It said baggage at many airports also was not checked carefully. In the past year, there were 1,966 attempts to smuggle weapons, mostly knives, aboard Soviet airliners, the newspaper said. At <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Domodedovo </LOCATION> airport, sophisticated baggage-checking equipment was bought but still is not in use, the newspaper said. `` For a year, the equipment has been kept in storage and planes are flying with crews that do not know who or what they are carrying,'' <PERSON> Leninskoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Znamya </PERSON> said. There have been three attempted hijackings this year. The latest on March 31, was an attempt to commandeer an airliner to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> foiled by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. Two attempts were reported in January, both stopped by police. In December 1988, four people commandeered a school bus, then demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> aboard an Ilyushin 76-T transport jet. They were arrested in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Three African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who refused to take part in their murder trial because they claimed to be prisoners of war were sentenced to death today for four killings. The three wore olive-green military uniforms with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colors throughout the proceedings. Their only active role in the trial came Tuesday, when one read a statement that said: `` We are soldiers in a patriotic army struggling to establish democracy and peace. We believe that we are prisoners of war.'' In an unusual procedure, the men's families were allowed to present evidence during the sentencing phase of the trial when the defendants refused to do so. The death penalty is mandatory for a murder conviction unless evidence shows there were mitigating circumstances. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> found there were none. He sentenced <PERSON> Jabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Masina </PERSON>, 36, <PERSON> Ting-Ting </PERSON> <PERSON> Masango </PERSON>, 28, and <LOCATION> Neo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Potsane </LOCATION>, 27, for killing two black policemen, a black town council member, and the council member's sister-in law. The defendents also each received a 25-year prison sentence for attempted murder in connection with a 1986 bombing at a bus stop, in which 17 people were injured, and for setting a mine on a road mainly used by military vehicles. A fourth defendant, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhura </PERSON>, 26, was sentenced to 25 years in prison in connection with the bomb and land mine. The four had been convicted March 2. The trial took place in the farming town of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. No execution date was set. <PERSON> Masina </PERSON> read the defendants' statement Tuesday before a packed gallery of more than 200 people chanting, `` Viva ANC!'' `` We say that the present South African government has no authority, no moral or legal right to rule over the people of this country,'' he said. `` It is therefore our duty to bring this crime to an end, to remove this illegal state.'' `` If we are hanged, our death will not be in vain,'' the statement said. `` Those who come after us will undoubtedly complete our mission in life.'' The statement said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> had not taken up arms until after it was outlawed in 1960, and `` it is contrary to the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to select targets whose sole objective is to strike at civilians.'' Without referring to the bus stop bomb, <PERSON> Masina </PERSON> said: `` There may be situations where individual combatants go beyond policy and commit acts which can not be condoned.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and must maintain separate housing districts from the 5 million whites, who control the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to overthrow the government and permit everyone to vote.

<HEAD>Strong Gain in Personal Income; Sluggish Advance in Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal income increased a strong 0.8 percent in March while consumer spending edged up 0.2 percent, a combination that boosted the personal savings rate to the highest level in nearly four years, the government reported today. As income advances continue to outpace spending increases, the personal savings rate has been inching upward and in March reached 6.3 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. That was highest level since the rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ hit 6.4 percent in May 1985. The March increase in income, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.35 trillion, was due partly to special factors such as profit-sharing payments to auto workers, a big increase in retroactive Social Security benefits and higher farm subsidy payments. Excluding those special factors, income rose 0.6 percent last month. The sluggish consumer spending, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.39 trillion last month, was consistent with a series of recent government reports suggesting economic growth is slowing down. The 0.2 percent advance in personal consumption expenditures in March was the weakest performance since spending held steady last September. The weakness was concentrated in spending on durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years. Spending on durables declined 1.5 percent last month, in part reflecting weak car sales. Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent, and spending on services advanced 0.5 percent. Today's report came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer spending for the first quarter overall rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent after adjusting for inflation, down from 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 1988 and the slwest pace in more than a year. The weakness was concentrated in spending on cars and home heating. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON>, the department's chief economist, said Wednesday that `` a slowdown in the consumer sector this year has been expected.'' He said the economic pattern of the first quarter _ slower consumer spending accompanied by increased exports and business investment _ was `` a desirable one for the sustainability of the economic expansion.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is projected a 2 percent increase in real personal consumption expenditures this year, down from 3.7 percent in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures in the economy by slowing demand. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity. Disposable, or after-tax, income increased 0.8 percent last month after rising 1.1 percent in February. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.8 percent in March to $ 2.59 trillion on an annual basis.

 An outpouring of sympathy from presidents to childhood neighbors followed the death of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, but many said the queen mother of comedy will live on through television reruns and her influence on comedy. The daffy, redheaded comedian whose harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy and delighted viewers for four decades died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal artery at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. She was 77 and died eight days after emergency heart surgery. A private burial was planned, reportedly with no funeral services in accordance with Miss Ball's wishes. `` God has her now, and, thanks to television, we'll have her forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>. Hospital switchboards were swamped with condolence calls and thousands of cards after Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s death, spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s family requested that any flowers sent to the Medical Center in her memory be distributed to other patients. Miss Ball maintained her sense of humor even when she was critically ill. Following her operation last week, her first words to her daughter, <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON>, were: `` Would n't you know _ this is the day I was going to get my hair done.'' Miss Ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery, so her death came as a shock. `` She had been walking, her spirits were up. Her family was with her,'' <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said. `` She responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery.'' He said she woke up early Wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back, and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and her late former husband, <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON>, starred in `` I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957. In the ground-breaking show, still seen in syndication worldwide, the late <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frawley </PERSON> played their neighbors, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON>. `` Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do,'' said actress-comedian <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>, star of the sitcom `` <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>.'' `` But it could n't be helped, because I memorized her shows.'' The show, one of the most popular in television history, was distinguished by Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s faultless timing, rubber-faced expressions, wide-mouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls. `` Working with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.D. in comedy,'' recalled <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>. `` What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.'' Comedian <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> was great because she represented every person. She showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves.'' Miss <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said her favorite episode involved a visit by the `` I Love Lucy'' characters to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> spotted actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> in a restaurant. `` That was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant,'' Miss <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` She was looking at him in a compact mirror, and trying to look at him surreptitiously. And that's just an example of how everyone can identify with <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosati </PERSON>, who lives down the street from the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home Miss Ball shared with husband <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, said he was watching a rerun of `` I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words `` In Memory of <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 1911-1989'' appeared. `` I felt I had lost someone in my family. I could n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Rosati </PERSON>, 40. `` I was watching <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> like I do every morning. She's one of the most-admired ladies in this town.'' He was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside Miss Ball's home on <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION> as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house. Tour vans passed by in a non-stop procession. On <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>'s Walk of Fame, flower arrangements were placed on Miss Ball's two stars _ one for her film work, one for television. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, owner of the Improvisation comedy clubs, said, `` The world of comedy has lost its first lady. Her death is an irreparable loss ... to our industry.'' Actor <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> recalled getting a personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy for the TV series `` Taxi.'' `` It made it like it had been blessed,'' he recalled. Admirers included President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at the time of Miss Ball's passing, and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her zest for life made her an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institution,'' the former president and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Just the mention of her name brings a smile. ... We love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and will miss her deeply.'' `` <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> possessed the gift of laughter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But she also embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love. She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and she was loved.'' `` To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,'' said `` Saturday Night Live'' comedian <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was born two years after `` I Love Lucy'' went off the air as a regular series. `` She did n't make me laugh out loud, I remember, she just made me happy about life.'' Said comic <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>: `` We're going to miss this lady, but not really, because she's still here. All those wonderful things they did together ... those wonderful TV shows ... are still available.'' Although Miss Ball had n't visited her hometown of <LOCATION> Jamestown </LOCATION>, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friends. <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosseti </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Celoron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Miss Ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their 50th wedding anniversary. `` Even though she was a big star, she was still just <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> to us,'' she recalled.

<TEXT>
 New cases of baby food tampering were reported today across <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and three babies were treated by doctors after eating food tainted by extortionists, officials said. Newspaper reports said food companies had paid $ 850,000 to extortionists and that the culprits were demanding another $ 1.7 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said police believe a gang that extorted $ 85,000 from a large supermarket chain this year was reponsible. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard, which is coordinating a nationwide inquiry, refused comment on the reports. According to police, parents today reported finding glass, pins, needles and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby food and in one case, powdered milk. They did not say how many new cases were reported, but as of Wednesday there had been at least 28 cases in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> alone. Three babies were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Leicester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> and later released. One mother found food glass fragments in her baby's food and another discovered two pieces of metal. The third baby became ill when eating a banana dessert, police said. New cases turned up in the province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> as well as across the border in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, police said. H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and Cow and <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading food manufacturers, on Wednesday offered a total of $ 169,000 for information leading to the conviction of the <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant, and Cow and <PERSON> Gate </PERSON> said they had received extortion demands. They refused to elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said police suspected a gang of extortionists who reportedly got $ 85,000 from a supermarket chain this year after threatening to poison food on its market shelves. The gang threatened to spike baby food unless it was paid $ 1.7 million, the newspaper said. It did not name the victimized supermarket chain. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid Today said without attribution that some manufacturers had already paid $ 845,000 to the extortionists. It did not name the companies. Today said the extortionists initially hid the money in various accounts with the <ORGANIZATION> Halifax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading savings and loans groups, then used cash cards to draw it bit by bit from <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> cash dispenser machines The paper did not say, but the implication appeared to be that the gang used false identities to open the accounts. It said more than 4,000 police staked out 768 <LOCATION> Halifax </LOCATION> cash dispenser machines around the country in a bid to trap the extortionists but that they failed. The government said 28 incidents of tampering with jars and cans of baby food have been reported since April 7, including 11 on Wednesday. In addition to today's victims, a 9-month-old girl in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> cut her mouth on a piece of razor blade in a yogurt container and two mothers were cut by glass shards in jars of infant food. None required hospital treatment. In one incident, sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda, was used to contaminate a jar of baby food. The white substance is a strong caustic base used in chemistry and oil refining. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and Cow and <PERSON> Gate </PERSON> said internal investigations have determined their baby food products were not tampered with during production. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, director of corporate affairs for <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said Wednesday the parent company `` shares the universal outrage'' over the tampering. He said, `` We have no reason at all to be concerned about tampering of products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Peach Bottom Plant Restarts After Shutdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Peach Bottom nuclear plant restarted today after a costly, two-year shutdown ordered by regulators after they found operators sleeping on the job. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> granted final approval for a restart of Unit 2 Wednesday night and the chain reaction began about 5:40 a.m., said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a spokesman for plant operator and part-owner <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Peach Bottom will operate at very low power for the next two weeks while safety checks are made If all goes well, the plant should reach full power in 14 weeks, he said. The plant has been closed since March 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said sleeping and inattention by 33 control room workers posed a safety threat to the public. <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> shook up its top management and had to pay some $ 250 million for plant modifications, replacement power and its share of a $ 125 million fine, the biggest in <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> history.

<TEXT>
 Army commander <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said today his troops would cooperate with a cease-fire observer force that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries plan to deploy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, foreign ministers of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> today called for a cease-fire to begin Friday at noon. They did not say how many observer troops would be deployed or when but said the plan should be carried out immediately. A special committee made up of six ministers has recommended stationing 312 officers from Arab armies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The observer force would be deployed along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> and other flashpoints in the hills above the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital, according to a text of the committee's plan published today in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers. Its main task would be monitoring the cease-fire, and officers would have no right to use arms except in self-defense, according to the text. The force's mandate is set for three months but could be extended. The newspapers did not say which countries would contribute to the force. `` We will cooperate positively with the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> force on the military level,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by Christian-controlled radio stations in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a Moslem Cabinet that rivals <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian military government, has welcomed setting up an Arab observer force. But his justice minister, <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, who heads the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, has rejected the plan. At least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded in six weeks of battles between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops and an alliance of the Syrian army and <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia Police said Syrian and Druse gunners sporadically shelled the coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with rockets and mortars today, keeping closed the only escape route for the 1 million Christians in their enclave. No casualties were reported. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 40,000 troops in northern, eastern and central areas as well as <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The newspapers said the Arab foreign ministers decided to postpone the issue of political reforms in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and election of a new president until after the observer force is in place. The presidency has been vacant since Sept. 22, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s six-year term ended with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to elect a successor. Before stepping down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, head of an interim Cabinet to rule pending the election of a new head of state. Moslem and leftist forces rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and pledged allegiance to the <ORGANIZATION> Hoss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, which governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. Moslems also are seeking political reforms that would give them an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians. The current fighting broke out March 8 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped a blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians joined the bombardment and sealed off the area's land exits.

<TEXT>
 An illiterate, unemployed construction worker has been convicted of the murders of four prostitutes, two of which had been listed as Southside Slayer killings. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Craine </PERSON>, 31, also was found guilty Wednesday of several counts of sexual assault in the strangulation murders between August 1985 and May 1987, but was acquitted on a fifth count of murder. The jury is scheduled to return May 8 to decide if <PERSON> Craine </PERSON> should be sentenced to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. It was the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man's second trial. His first ended in mistrial in August. <PERSON> Craine </PERSON> is one of three men arrested in connection with the slayings of 18 women whose deaths were so similar homicide detectives believed they may have been the work of a serial killer. Most of the victims were prostitutes who had been stabbed or strangled and their bodies dumped in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> or adjacent communities. In March 1986, before any arrests were made, police announced the formation of what they called a <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to investigate slayings that dated to 1983. <PERSON> Craine </PERSON> was charged with three of those killings and two unrelated slayings. He confessed to three murders when he was arrested in 1987, but later recanted on the witness stand. The defense portrayed <PERSON> Craine </PERSON> as an illiterate man of low intelligence who confessed during an aggressive interrogation simply to tell investigators what they wanted to hear. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Siebert </PERSON> was charged with two killings last year, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> was convicted of one slaying.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> possesses a permit to carry a concealed weapon in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, because he feels threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls `` the nut element,'' the chief judge of <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` It's very unusual'' for anyone to be granted a permit to carry a concealed weapon, said Chief Judge <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. But his predecessor, Judge <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, granted North the original one-year permit in October 1987 because he was convinced <PERSON> North </PERSON> showed a legitimate need, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who became chief judge the following January, renewed the license for two more years on Oct. 13, 1988, a month after <PERSON> North </PERSON> re-applied. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, is awaiting a jury's verdict on charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair. He was identified last July as the target of a potential assassination plot involving one of eight man charged with illegal pro-Libyan activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Just one other person received a concealed license permit in 1987, and of 77 applications filed in 1988, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the sole recipient, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` He is the only one that I have ever felt satisfied and demonstrated a need to carry a concealed weapon,'' said <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. The county's chief judge makes the final decision on concealed weapon permits, based on need. Papers filed by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, focused on two threats to the life of the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide. `` According to experts, dangers come from two basic sources _ the terrorist element, which wants to fulfill its promise to even the score, and the nut element, which surfaces in situations like this,'' the papers said. <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> law allows residents to carry weapons in view, but those who wish to carry a concealed weapon must go through a complicated approval process, said <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>. The permit is only in effect when <PERSON> North </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where he lives. `` It's only good in the jurisdiction it's issued in,'' said a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police spokesman. `` You get a gun permit in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, it's only good in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.''

 A mentally disabled, AIDS-stricken 7-year-old stepped into a classroom for the first time in her life today, with bows in her hair, a knapsack on her back and the cheers of supporters surrounding her. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who fought a 2 -LCB- - year court battle against school officials who feared a health risk, called today the most important day in her daughter <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s life A federal district judge Wednesday cleared the way for <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> to attend class without being confined to a glass isolation booth, as required in an earlier ruling. Supporters cheered as Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> walked into the one-story, red-brick <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where 201 students are enrolled. There were no protests. `` She'll finally, for the first time in her life, be able to be with children and spend all the time she can with them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said as they went inside. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> wore a pink dress and pink bows in her hair and carried a toy that plays the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> song `` It's a Small World.'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told reporters later that when <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> entered the classroom, `` the children came around her and one of them hugged her.'' `` They just surrounded her,'' she said. `` They did n't need any introductions.'' Principal <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she sent notes to parents Wednesday to prepare them for <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s arrival and received seven calls of concern, with one mother saying she was not ready to accept the risk. Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, who pressed a suit through a federal appeals court to keep the little girl from being put in a glass-walled booth in the class for mentally disabled, physically impaired children, drove mother and daughter to school. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> became the 12th student in the class. `` It's a wonderful day for her,'' he said. `` She'll do wonderfully here. She's going to take off like a rocket.'' But he said he expected her first day to be difficult because `` she does n't have any exprience with other kids.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, a family friend and head of an AIDS support group called `` <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frenz </PERSON>,'' was among seven supporters on hand to watch <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> enter public school for the first time. `` I know she'll benefit from playing with other kids,'' she said. `` She's always around adults and always having to look up. Now she'll have eye contact with children.'' The child, who had been taught at home since June 1987, was once told she could attend class on the condition she remained inside a glass booth. However, the issue of a partition became moot when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> decided <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> posed no significant threat to her classmates. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> predicted Wednesday that the ruling will have far-reaching effects. `` I'm just a trial lawyer,'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said, `` but people who really do a lot of this work tell me this is a landmark case _ that it will have a major impact around the country.'' In an earlier ruling, <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> tried to allay the school system's fears by ordering the isolation booth for the incontinent child until the girl became toilet trained and learned to stop sucking her fingers. But Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said she would not send her daughter to school to sit in a `` glass cage'' and appealed. `` I'm so happy. I do n't have bitterness for anything,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said after the ruling. `` My daughter is not a monkey. I've always said that `` All she understands is she will be going in to play with some little people. She does n't know what school is; she has n't been to it.'' School board attorney Crosby Few said he was glad the judge had ruled and would recommend that it be followed. In December, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> sent the case back to <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>, saying the child must be placed in a regular classroom setting unless evidence proved <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> posed a significant risk to other children through bodily secretions. The judge said she learned through recent sworn statements that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> is `` capable of being instructed not to suck or mouth her fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully toilet trained.'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a nurse who adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> as an infant in her native <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, argued that in order to develop fully <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> needed to be with other children for interaction, stimulation and socialization. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> was stricken with acquired immune deficiency syndrome from tranfusions of tainted blood shortly after her premature birth.

 Heavy rains caused a landslide that killed at least 31 gold miners in northeastern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> and trapped up to 100 more, the <ORGANIZATION> Burundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Four people have been rescued from the caves in <LOCATION> Butihinda </LOCATION> since the accident Sunday, and 31 are known dead, a local administrator told the news agency. The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. The landslide occurred so quickly the miners had no chance to escape, the provincial governor, <PERSON> Bayaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Deo </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Bujumbura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` There were no injuries, only deaths. It was so sudden that no one was able to get away,'' he told the radio. `` It is not possible to give an exact figure, but people who were present estimate that there are between 50 and 100'' trapped. The trapped miners apparently had gone into the mines at night to prospect for gold for themselves, according to a reporter at the <ORGANIZATION> Burundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>'s government regulates the little official mining done in the central African nation. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> produces less than 44 pounds of gold annually, according to a recent survey of the country's mining industry prepared by a Western embassy

 An Arab League delegation was meeting today with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to discuss a cease-fire plan for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a U.S.-supported Israeli proposal for elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.

The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration closed in on the ground the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is engaged in terrrorism, but the administration later opened talks with the group. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> delegation is headed by <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the league's representative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and includes Ambassadors <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mohsin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. The league has proposed stationing 312 officers from Arab armies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to monitor a cease-fire under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> supervision. The country is torn by warfare between Christian and Moslem factions, with 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers approved the cease-fire proposal at a meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, today. The Council of Ministers from the 22 member countries, after nearly seven hours of discussions, said the cease-fire should begin Friday at noon. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said that in the afternoon meeting, the delegation also would discuss with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections among Palestinian Arabs on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Energy Chief Discloses New Delay In Restart of Key Defense Reactors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today he had pushed back the target date for resuming production of a radioactive gas needed in nuclear warhead production, but he said the delay would not harm national security. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said in a letter to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees that he was not yet convinced the three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> nuclear reactors that produce the gas, called tritium, could be operated safely. `` ... I believe safe startup is achievable early enough in 1990 to maintain a viable weapons stockpile,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> released copies of his letter after meeting in his office with a group of reporters. He said he notified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of the delay on Monday. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told reporters the main reason for putting off restart of the reactors was a need to resolve safety issues and complete retraining of reactor operators. `` There are so many issues that are unresolved in my mind, as they relate to safety,'' he said. `` I will not allow them -LRB- the reactors -RRB- to be started this year.'' Up to now, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had said it intended to restart the first of the three reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, by the end of this year. It had said quick resumption of operations was required to assure an adequate supply of tritium, which is needed to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads. The three reactors were shut down a year ago because of safety concerns. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said last fall that unless at least one of the reactors was running again by late this year, the reliability of the weapons stockpile would be jeopardized. The exact size of the tritium supply is classified. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also disclosed that he planned to announce soon a `` new approach'' to determining the feasibility of constructing the nation's first permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste, at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, Nev. The state government and many environmental groups are strongly opposed to the project, which has been plagued by delays and is not scheduled for completion until 2003. `` We'll probably have to restructure that program in the very near time frame and announce some kind of new approach,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. He gave no details.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today there is increasing evidence that foreign drug-traffickers are using American-made chemicals to refine cocaine and `` we should demand that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> corporations act responsibly'' to prevent such abuses. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said few Americans are aware that `` illegally diverted barrels of dangerous chemicals _ clearly marked with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate logos _ are routinely seized'' in the jungles of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses `` by and large'' have supported government efforts to curb drug abuse, `` industry's got to do more,'' the president said. `` And I hope that parents' groups and stockholders are listening today,'' he said in the speech to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> here. `` We should demand that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> corporations act responsibly, and that they not tolerate chemicals ending up in criminal hands.'' More than 100 striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees and their supporters demonstrated outside the hotel where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. They gave a thumbs-down salute as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade rode past. The president, who has refused union appeals to intervene in the nearly 8-week-old strike, waved in return. In advance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration hoped that corporations would take `` voluntary action'' to determine the end use of chemicals they sell and ship out of the country. But in his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that a wide-ranging anti-drug abuse bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year authorizes the government to take action against the diversion of chemicals for drug production. He said `` regulations are now being drafted to tighten controls on the chemicals needed to refine cocaine.'' The president said the time had come to `` rid the world of these toxins'' and said `` we're going to start right here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... because, all too often, that's the original source of the basic industrial chemicals needed to produce cocaine.'' `` Traffickers have hit us where it hurts,'' he told the gathering of drug enforcement officers from Latin American nations. `` Now, we're going to exploit their vulnerabilities, crimping the flow of materials, without which they can not roduce. No chemicals, no cocaine.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed to the seizure by a 30-nation task force last year of 155,000 pounds of highly flammable ether, almost 450,000 pounds of acetone and more than 50,000 pounds of hydrochloric acid. He said Colombian authorities in January destroyed 25 cocaine laboratories and `` enough chemicals to make approximately 83 metric tons of cocaine. The damage that's done when 83 tons of coke hits <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> streets is pretty obvious.'' In a second speech today, at the dedication of a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> drug-interdiction communications center in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the president said `` our purpose is simple and close to home: to keep drugs out of the lockers, the classrooms and off the playgrounds of our schools, to redeem the children of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from the scourge of drugs.'' `` From this site, civilian and defense radars will work together, under the watchful eye of <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and Customs duty officers, who will coordinate interception by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, whether it means scrambling a jet fighter, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter or speedboats guided by the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lightning </ORGANIZATION> strike force,'' he said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes his trip, coming as he neared the 100-day mark of his presidency, has gone `` very well.'' He said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to travel around the country frequently to discuss his agenda and programs. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> feels it is important to `` report to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, tell them what he is doing, discuss his program, talk about various issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will often make speeches before the American people, visit a lot of states.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he expects that the administration will have a drug-related crime package to propose to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> within two weeks. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> indicated to reporters Wednesday that drug control director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> still was studying options to recommend to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, in a major policy speech today, intensified pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons. Addressing Parliament, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> repeated his call for negotiations to reduce the number of short-range nuclear rockets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as atomic artillery. `` Because of the range of the short-range systems, the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is affected more by these weapons than the other partners in the alliance,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` It is to me self-evident for our friends to have the same understanding for our interests as we have shown many times for theirs,'' he added. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been critical of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for superpower talks on tactical atomic arms deployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> have indicated their support for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on the issue. Many lawmakers applauded when Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> indirectly criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for their stand. `` There is much to fear in this world. But we certainly do n't have to fear negotiations, and we do n't have to fear talks with a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is ready for negotiations,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> population favors eliminating all nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range weapons are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> reassured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners that his government does not want to eliminate those battlefield nuclear weapons. `` In the current circumstances, land, sea and airborne short-range nuclear weapons are still important in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. The chancellor also said the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> can not afford to make unilateral disarmament moves `` as long as the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has a superior military potential and security-political risks continue to exist.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has called on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to delay a decision on replacing the aging short-range <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> nuclear missiles that are on West German soil until after national elections scheduled for late next year. <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for talks on short-range atomic arsenals `` half-hearted'' and repeated his demand that all those weapons be eliminated from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s call for negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons appears to be part of a wide-ranging attempt to win public support. In recent weeks he has taken a number of actions to try to bolster his sagging popularity and to defuse criticism that has threatened his conservative coalition government. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has reshuffled his Cabinet and has reversed himself on several widely unpopular issues, abandoning for example a plan to extend compulsary military service terms from 15 to 18 months. While trying to improve his image among West Germans eager for arms control and domestic reform, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has incurred the wrath of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for his proposal on short-range nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has launched a diplomatic offensive against <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal, instructing its ambassadors in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries to present arguments against starting up negotiations on short-range weapons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also has criticized <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s move and is expected to discuss the matter with him during talks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Sunday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fear that starting up negotiations on the tactical arsenals could lead to their elimination and increase the threat from superior <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and other West German leaders say the climate is ripe for stepping up disarmament efforts with the Soviets.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said today he will no longer tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about airline security alerts for fear of leaks and is considering a bill to make unauthorized disclosure a crime. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also said that passengers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines may be barred from taking electronic devices such as portable computers on aircraft following the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 air disaster over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Speaking to American reporters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on the last leg of a five-nation European tour, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he was adamant about not discussing publicly intelligence-gathering or unannounced airline security bulletins. `` I have just sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advising them that I will no longer disseminate information to them regarding security bulletins until I am absolutely sure that they have a mechanism in place to protect that information,'' he said. He said he plans new regulations about leaking airline `` security-type information,'' adding: `` I may seek legislation making it a crime.'' Last month, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> criticized a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a security bulletin sent by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to airports and carriers March 16 about a possible hijacking of an American airliner in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said public disclosure of all warnings would mean they would be taken for granted. After the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was accused by critics in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of bungling the dissemination to airlines of warnings from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that Palestinian terrorists had devised a new radio cassette bomb. Flight 103, bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was blown apart by a tiny bomb hidden in a radio cassette recorder. It crashed on the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> later today, also said he expects the latest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bomb-detection equipment, thermal neutron analysis, to be installed at several European airports by year's end. The machines can find plastic explosives missed by X-rays. In a $ 60-million program, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accelerated development of thermal neutron analysis after the Flight 103 disaster Dec. 21. The first device is due to be installed at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, in July. `` Every place I have gone, everyone wants to do more,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after meeting government officials in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. On electronic devices, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that unless a sure means of examination is found `` the ban of such devices is an option that will be looked at.''

 A tornado killed at least 500 people, injured thousands and devastated more than 20 villages in central <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, the government said today. The tornado Wednesday night blew away people, houses and animals as it whirled at 100 mph through the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area, 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. Survivors said the funnel cloud raged for 10 minutes and flattened `` everything, including buildings.'' `` I saw black clouds gathering in the sky. In moments we found we were flying along with the house,'' said <PERSON> Sayeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>, a 30-year-old homemaker in <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>. Another tornado hit the <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION> district, 25 miles east of the capital, killing five people and injuring 500, the English-language newspaper New Nation said. The tornadoes brought with them rain and hail and followed a two-month drought that has threatened to destroy more than half the rice crop in this impoverished nation. The tornadoes hit hours after President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> ordered nationwide prayers for rain. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> alone, more than 75,000 people joined <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> in a prayer service. A senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 5,000 people were injured in <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>. He said 500 bodies had been recovered. Troops searched through rubble today for more victims. In <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION>, nothing was standing as far as the eye could see. The village of 10,000 resembled a bombed area, with houses uprooted and electric poles twisted. Mrs. <PERSON> Begum </PERSON> said she, her husband and four of their children were lifted through the air and all were injured. A fifth child, a 5-year-old boy, was found about two miles away and received severe bruises, she said. At <LOCATION> Nandeshwari </LOCATION>, a neighboring village of at least 120 houses, there were no standing structures or people in sight. <PERSON> Tofael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a teacher, wept bitterly, holding a torn shirt that had been worn by his son. Both his son and daughter were missing. `` What shall I do with this shirt. Why should Allah curse me like this,'' he cried. He said he had brought the shirt for his son to wear during the Moslems' religious festival of Eid next week. Authorities said more than 500 people were admitted to hospitals and many were in critical condition.

 Lottery officials could n't confirm today that anyone won the record $ 100 million-plus <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Super 7 lottery, but a group of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> factory employees told friends and relatives they had the winning numbers. Officials have said two computer systems may need until Friday to complete a scan of all 87.3 million Super 7 plays this week and perform other security checks before any winning ticket in Wednesday's drawing can be validated. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON>, lottery deputy executive director, said this morning he could not confirm that any potential winners had called lottery headquarters. `` We get a lot of calls, but there's been no claimants so far,'' <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> told reporters outside lottery headquarters in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>. `` We always receive crank and legitimate calls, all kinds of calls, even until the wee hours.'' At <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, office manager of the <PERSON> Harbison-Walker </PERSON> brick factory, said a foreman and 13 press mechanics set out for <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> claiming to have a winning ticket as she pulled up to the plant this morning. `` We're all excited about it,'' said <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Palya </PERSON>, closing manager for a grocery in <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>. `` The customers all know, and they're talking about it in town and when they're coming through for groceries. A receptionist at the factory said the workers each spent about $ 10 on tickets for the drawing. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said lottery officials would have an announcement later today but he refused to say what details would be disclosed. The huge ticket sales mean the jackpot will be something higher than $ 100 million, lottery officials said. <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said the size of the final jackpot wo n't be known until the lottery receives bids from a pool of seven insurance companies for an annuity to cover the prize, payable in annual installments over 26 years. The numbers, picked live on television, were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40; 41; 45; 60; 71. To win the grand prize, a ticket must contain seven of the 11 numbers. Six numbers carry a prize in the thousands. Having four numbers means a $ 7 prize. The drawing went off without a hitch at a television studio, while crews from at least six TV stations stood by to broadcast the drawing to affiliates across the country. Millions of dreams died and hours of standing in line for a ticket went for naught when the numbers were drawn _ some even before then. At the Shop' n' Save in <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said two customers were still in line when the lottery computers were automatically turned off at 6:56 p.m.. At the Penn-Ohio Drug Store in Sharon, more than 75 people were in line when sales ended `` There was one guy who was mad because his friend got in before he did, and he said, ` He's not getting a ride home,' and he started to leave,'' said night supervisor <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinckes </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` But I told him the machine got cut off before his friend got to play, and he seemed happy.'' At a minimum $ 100 million, the top prize would eclipse the previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record jackpot, $ 69.9 million, for which four winning tickets were held April 15 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The world's largest lottery jackpot, $ 159 million, was split by hundreds of people in December in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Officials said the Super 7 prize would probably top the world record if no winning tickets were sold this week. The jackpot would then be rolled over. But <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a deputy revenue secretary, said the odds against the jackpot carrying over for the seventh-straight week were about 4,000 to one. Those who played the lottery used a variety of methods for choosing numbers. Nearly three-quarters of all tickets used numbers picked at random by the computer. Jazz saxophonist <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, on the other hand, based his choices on the serial number of his latest album, `` Then and Now.'' <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> football coach <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> included numbers of some of his players, including quarterback <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> -LRB- 12 -RRB- and fullback <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> -LRB- 25 -RRB-. In Erie, two lottery pilgrims who drove more than 200 miles from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> were robbed of about $ 850 early Wednesday as they waited for a convenience store to open, authorities said. As the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, men waited about 5:30 a.m. in an automobile, a man asked what they were doing. `` He pulled a gun and took all their money,'' police Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said. `` They had driven all night. They never did get their tickets.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> must release about 1,200 semiautomatic rifles impounded at an airport as part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's ban on the importation of assault weapons. The decision was issued Wednesday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who criticized the temporary ban, initiated by federal drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The ban was `` obviously the product of a ` hurry-up' skull session, if not a stampede reaction set off by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> did not overturn the ban for other rifle models imported to other cities. But he ordered federal officials to deliver to <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Trussville </LOCATION> about 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles impounded by customs agents at the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> and another 3,000 to be sent from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The company argued that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> approved import permits for the rifles before the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced its ban in late March. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was reviewing the decision and had not decided whether to appeal the judge's ruling, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. There was no immediate comment from the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said in court documents that releasing the weapons would undermine the government's policy review of the effects of the temporary ban. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said the administration issued the ban without consulting American gun dealers or foreign manufacturers of semiautomatic rifles, and without re-examining <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>'s past approval of the Steyr AUG-SA. The ban followed a schoolyard shooting in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> involving an assault rifle. Gun South owner and president <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who sued four weeks ago, testified his company would face bankruptcy if it could not receive and sell the rifles it has ordered and committed to pay for. The company also claimed the <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AUG-SA </ORGANIZATION> rifle is used for hunting, the criterion on which <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> had approved previous shipments of the rifles. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that the public interest in halting importation of semiautomatic and automatic rifles pending a review outweighed any potential harm the temporary ban might cause Gun South. `` This is a small case but a significant example of why our justice system enjoys the envy of the world. Once again, a federal judge has enjoined the government from violating the right of way at a constitutional intersection,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, an attorney for Gun South.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is halting more than $ 100 million in low-income housing renovation projects following an investigation that found former top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> appointees won lucrative contracts through a system rife with favoritism, officials said today. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inspector general said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 59 million in excess housing assistance over the life of 15-year contracts that the inspector general examined. The report said if the pattern exists throughout the program, the excess could approach $ 413 million. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was halting all fiscal 1989 funding for programs in which contracts had not yet been agreed upon and ordering an audit of existing contracts. His actions stopped funding for 35 projects valued at more than $ 100 million while they are reconsidered, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s assistant, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, said today. Eight other projects for which contracts were already in place will be allowed to continue, subject to audit, she said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Wednesday that the investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general found `` fundamental flaws'' in the department's Moderate Rehabilitation program. He said the investigation revealed that the selection and allocation process `` was undocumented, ignored existing standards and regulations, and was based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of non-public information.'' The report centered on a rehabilitation program that provides $ 225 million a year for housing in which developers acquire and renovate existing projects. By winning the contracts with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, developers are able to receive low-interest commercial loans backed with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s guarantee of federally subsidized tenants. The report by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and employees, actively participated, often as developers or consultants, in the projects. It named top-ranking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, including former under secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and former assistant secretary for housing <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, who later became owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> is now the ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. Both he and <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> are from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Efforts to reach them by telephone were not immediately successful. The report named several other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who earned money as consultants on the projects after leaving government. Among them was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former special assistant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The report said <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> collected $ 1.3 million in consultant fees on such projects. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-time executive assistant, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, was also identified as an owner-developer in six projects. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said today he found no evidence of criminal activity, but that the report was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity section for review. `` We at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> are committed to ending both the reality and the perception that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s funding processes have been tolerant of or inattentive to program abuse,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` However, the inspector general has assured me that his investigation found no evidence of criminality or legal wrongdoing of any kind.'' The audit was critical of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> management as well as management by locally run public housing authorities. `` We concluded that the moderate rehabilitation program was poorly managed,'' the report said. `` There was little or no documentation or accountability for the public housing authorities selected by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to receive the funding allocations. `` Moreover the housing authorities selected developers without complying with the need for an effective competitive selection process, and oftentimes in violation of their own administrative plans. There was an absence of clear written policy and guidelines.'' The investigation covered the rehabilitation of 35,780 units over a five - year period, 1984-1988 It found favoritism in the awarding of the funding, saying that over half the units in that period were awarded in 10 states, which by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> formula were fairly entitled to only 16 percent of the units. Those states were <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The report said former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and employees `` actively sought and participated in the program as developers, consultants or lender representatives.'' Of 69 projects examined, such former insiders participated in 55, it said. It said consultants received fees of $ 500 to $ 1,500 per unit from developers, and that often there was no written contracts. `` A perception of favoritism and abuse evolved, thereby impacting program integrity.'' it said. The report said, `` There is little assurance that housing is being provided to those locales having the greatest need, and that limited program funds are being spent efficiently and effectively.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he was canceling all funding selections in the program for the current fiscal year that are still pending, and that over 300 projects already executed will be audited. He said he asked for the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> general counsel to review existing governmental and department ethics and personnel laws and regulations in light of the finding.

 Forty-three people have been arrested in the latest wave of demonstrations against <PERSON> Chippewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> spearfishing in off-reservation public lakes. The arrests were made Wednesday when large crowds gathered at boat landings in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> where the annual Chippewa spearing season began last weekend prior to the fishing season for non-Indians. Federal courts since 1983 have upheld 19th century treaties in which the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> deeded northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and were guaranteed the right to hunt, fish, trap and harvest wild grain on public land. Critics say the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' spears leave too few trophy-size fish for the rod-and-reel season that begins next month. More than 400 people rallied Wednesday at the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, complaining that spearing discourages sport fishing upstate and reduces the region's summer tourism business. Tribal members are expected to spear about 30,000 fish this spring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch of about 800,000 fish annually in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> have announced plans to spear at 254 lakes. Five of the tribe's six <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> bands fished Wednesday. Wardens and police have been kept busy this season shielding spearers from hecklers, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> administrator of enforcement for the Department of Natural Resources. `` It's starting out every night with a crowd someplace,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> fish at night with battery-powered lights to illuminate walleyed pike, muskellunge and other fish in shallow water. At <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flowage </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reservoir, 35 people were arrested Wednesday night for disorderly conduct or obstructing police after walking into a restricted area at a public boat landing used by <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunelius </PERSON>, a DNR spokesman. About 150 miles to the west, six people were taken into custody at <LOCATION> Balsam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for various offenses from scattering nails on roads to disorderly conduct, <PERSON> Kunelius </PERSON> said. One man was arrested for disorderly conduct at <LOCATION> Crescent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where a crowd peaked at about 200 people. Another was arrested for tire slashing at <LOCATION> Seven-Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where there were no spearers, <PERSON> Kunelius </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers called today for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said they will send observers to monitor it. The ministers also said blockades of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s ports should be lifted. The blockades touched off six weeks of intensive fighting between Christian and Moslem forces that have left more than 270 people dead. The Council of Ministers from the 22 member countries, after nearly seven hours of discussions, said the cease-fire should begin Friday at noon. Their final statement did not say how many observers will be sent or when, saying only that the plan should be carried out `` without delay.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sharaa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> told reporters at the close of the session that his country is ready to give any aid a special six-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee will need to help end the fighting. About 40,000 Syrian troops are based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains it is not part of the conflict. However, the Syrian army, in alliance with <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia of about 7,000 men, has been fighting the 20,000 Christian troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> since March 8. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> supports <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in the fighting. The Council of Ministers met from midnight to 3:30 a.m. today, then suspended the session. The council met again for more than three hours beginning at 1 p.m. before issuing the final communique. The special committee charged in January with finding a solution to the conflict, composed of foreign ministers from six of the 22 <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> member nations, has recommended stationing 312 Arab observers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, sources said. An Arab League delegation also met today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to discuss the cease-fire plan. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, whose blockade of Moslem controlled ports touched off the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, has repeatedly called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help end the nation's civil war.

<HEAD>St. Paul Follows Its Twin City Minneapolis in Plastics Ban</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved an ordinance today that would ban plastic packaging, despite an effort in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to block the local restriction. Council member <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimond </PERSON> said community concern about the city's waste disposal problems led to the 6-1 vote. `` When you see that groundswell, we're certainly headed in the right direction,'' he said. The council voted to ban non-degradable, non-returnable, non-recyclable packaging. The local ordinance, identical to one approved last month in the twin city of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, would become effective in July 1990. A state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused Tuesday to remove from a recycling bill a provision that would block such local plastics bans. Most supporters of the anti-plastics laws believe the bans should be implemented on a county or state level. Advocates of such bans say plastics take up too much space when buried in landfills and do not decompose. They also argue that plastics might release harmful emissions when burned in incinerators. Plastics manufacturers and grocers, who say the bans will be an economic disaster, promised to fight the anti-plastics laws at the state level and in the courts. Among items that could be banned under the Twin Cities' ordinances are foam egg cartons and trays in meat packages, plastic products shipped into the state, such as ketchup bottles and peanut butter jars, grocery bags, drinking cups, serving trays and plates The ordinances expand on less stringent laws adopted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said Council member <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, who wrote the ordinance and shared it with <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>, long portrayed as the villain of the mutiny on the H.M.S. Bounty, is regaining heroic stature as the 200th anniversary of the revolt led by <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> is observed Friday. `` The old view of <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> as a bully is largely legend and I'm afraid that <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> have a lot to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admiral <PERSON> Laughton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> played <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> as a flogging villain in the `` Mutiny on the Bounty'' films of 1935 and 1962, in which <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Brando </PERSON> portrayed <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, the leader of the mutiny, as upright and virtuous. `` <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> was abrasive but the mutiny was a flash-in-the-pan affair that might easily have never taken place if he had not upset <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> the day before by accusing him of stealing his coconuts,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said in an interview. `` In fact,'' said <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> was a great navigator, a brave commander in battle and a fine seaman who looked after the comfort and health of his sailors in an age when going to sea could let you in for a pretty rough time.'' The 68-year-old admiral, who won the Distinguished Service Cross for World War II high seas action, greeted visitors to a preview Thursday of an exhibition open through Oct. 1 at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, to mark the 200th anniversary of the mutiny. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, who reinterpreted <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> as sympathetic in the 1984 film, `` The Bounty,'' opened the exhibition and said: `` I think <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> was a perfectionist who failed in human relations. But he was a great character whose strength and vision made history.'' The museum show celebrates <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>'s long career, his heroism under the command of Adm. <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, his achievements as navigator with explorer Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and his feat of seamanship after being cast adrift from the Bounty, of which he was captain. With 18 loyal crewmen, he sailed a 23-foot open boat 3,618 nautical miles in 47 days to <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. A central exhibit is the Bounty's chronometer which the mutineers took to their <LOCATION> Pitcairn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> refuge. Also displayed are blackened relics of wood, copper and iron sheathing from the Bounty, which Christian burned, knowing the Admiralty would try to hunt him down. Christian's brother, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, resented <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>'s published account and replied with his own denouncing <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> as a blackguard. `` That was the start of what we now feel is the legend of bully <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, the museum's exhibitions officer. <PERSON> Glyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a descendant of the mutineer, said: `` <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> was a slaver, a law-breaker, a mutineer, a pirate, and probably a fool, but there never really was a mutiny of the Bounty's crew.'' `` It was really a revolt by one man against another and I look forward to the day when there is no urge to blame either of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> had been sent to <LOCATION> Tahiti </LOCATION> to collect breadfruit plants. The mutiny took place after the Bounty's crew had spent six months in the tropical paradise. `` It must have been a marvelous place with all those beautiful girls,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. `` Discipline became too lax and <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> had no <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> to enforce it on the ship, which is customary in the navy, and no commissioned officers.'' Ten recaptured mutineers were returned to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and court-martialed, and three of them were hanged. <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> was honorably acquitted by a naval inquiry.

<HEAD>California Plans `Quality Assurance' Labels on Produce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE BIGHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pressured by consumer and grocer concerns over food safety, state agriculture officials are about to offer a `` quality assurance'' seal for produce grown by farmers who agree to meet all pesticide regulations. The plan developed quickly after consumer scares in March over the use of the chemical Alar on apples and the discovery of cyanide in two Chilean grapes. Despite the short lead time, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> is expected to inaugurate the new system early next month unless a hitch develops. The language of the `` quality assurance'' seals has been under review by the state Attorney General and governor's staffs this week to see if it would present any legal liabilities for the state. Participating growers would sign a contract with the state in which they would agree to comply with all laws and regulations and manufacturer's label instructions governing any pesticides they use. The state will test about 2,500 samples of crops from those signing up for the voluntary program. That sampling, financed by an additional one cent per box levy paid by participants, will be in addition to the 8,000-9 ,000 pesticide tests the department already conducts on fruits and vegetables each year, by far the most of any state in the nation Growers in the program whose crops are below tolerance limits for pesticide residue will be able to label their produce with a `` quality assurance'' sticker certified by the state. `` This will give them a seal to use that it is California-produced in accordance with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> laws and regulations,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who oversees the <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>'s pesticide regulatory program. `` Retailers and growers alike feel that kind of thing will help put the public's mind at ease.'' However, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said growers should quit using pesticides and predicted that the program will fail because buyers who consider pesticides dangerous wo n't be appeased by a seal on produce. `` People have the perception this stuff is dangerous,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` Well, it's an accurate perception.'' After the Alar and cyanide incidents, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> persuaded state agricultural officials to start this program, said President <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON>. `` We have no control as retailers what is being used by growers,'' <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> said. `` All we want to know is, if we are buying it and we are paying for it, that it's safe for consumers.'' Officials of grower organizations expressed cautious enthusiasm, although some felt the system should be mandatory instead of voluntary or should be delayed a year to allow more time to prepare for the change. `` The indication we've gotten from retailers and also from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is that they intend to buy only from those who have the seal, so suddenly we have some questions,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Matoian </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Grape and Tree Fruit League. `` Once one person puts a stamp on a box, everybody's going to have to do it to keep their markets.'' Iceberg lettuce probably will be the first crop to use the new seals because growers report they are ready to sign up now. `` The position our industry has taken is they do support the seal, and they're ready to start implementing it as soon as the state wants to do it,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iceberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lettuce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Beaver </PERSON> feels food is safe now, but because the public perceives that some is n't, such a program is necessary to help restore consumers' confidence.

 More than 150,000 students and workers calling for democracy pushed through police lines Thursday and marched cheering and singing through central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest protest ever Workers by the thousands joined the students, giving them popsicles and bread in their strongest act of support in 11 days of protests. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents escorted the students on bicycles and foot and tried to shield them from soldiers and police, who had issued harsh warnings against marches. But the security forces were unarmed, and although they pushed fiercely against advancing students in a vain effort to halt their march, they did not use other force against them. There was no immediate information on any injuries in the crush. The march turned instead into a jubilant procession. For more than 15 hours, the students marched through streets and under overpasses jammed with thousands of applauding people. High-rise dwellers leaned from their windows to watch, store clerks stood in their doorways and the patients of one hospital emerged in blue-and-white-striped pajamas. The march was the biggest and most dramatic action yet by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students in their campaign for sweeping democratic reforms, including a free press and an end to corruption. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called for restraint on the part of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities and hoped the demonstrations would remain peaceful. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes in and supports the right of peaceful assembly, including peaceful protest and the freedom of expression,'' department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutweler </PERSON> said. Even before the march ended, the government announced it was willing to hold talks with the students `` at any time'' if the students return to their campuses and `` adopt a calm and reasonable attitude.'' However, a government spokesman quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the talks should be conducted through official student groups already rejected by the protesters as non-democratic. The government calls the protesters' newly formed unions illegal. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> later quoted a city spokesman as saying many of the students' demands, such as wiping out corruption, were `` in accord with the wishes of the party and the government.'' The spokesman, who was not identified, urged the students to return to class, disband their illegal organizations and stop agitating. Protest leaders did not immediately respond. Other government statements read on the evening TV news emphasized the need for stability for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to develop and accused some protesters of trying to overthrow the party and government. The students have called for Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to resign and say senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, is too old to rule. Most students say their campaign is not anti-government and they only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human rights. The march was the biggest since the communists took power in 1949. Student protests in 1986-87 resulted in the ouster of reformer <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. Hu's death on April 15 touched off the new protests. `` The government has lost face,'' said one student as marchers surged onto <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic seat of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It was not clear what the next step in the protest would be. The students say they plan another march Thursday, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement for democracy. At least 75,000 students from 20 schools took part in the more than 20-mile march. The government warned Wednesday that the march would be illegal, and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources had reported soldiers were brought into the city from outlying counties. `` We fear nothing,'' read one of hundreds of banners waved by the students. The marchers met the first police barricade a half-mile from its start at <ORGANIZATION> Quinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but the students managed in 15 minutes of violent shoving to press through three rows of police. `` It was like watching an iron bar bend,'' one viewer said. Five more police lines were breached in the same way. Police at one barricades sent the students through with pats on the back, and several officers told the youths, `` We understand you. We wo n't hit you.'' At one point bystanders rushed to surround police trucks that pulled up beside the marchers. `` Do n't hit the students!'' the crowd chanted. A similar scene occurred at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, when a dozen trucks filled with soldiers pulled up in the marchers' path. Dozens of people climbed onto the sides of the trucks. `` Welcome 38th Army!'' they shouted, handing the soldiers student protest leaflets. Students also gave out copies of a letter written in English to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization, asking `` in this moment of top emergency ... for sympathetic understanding and moral support.''

 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON>'s husband died five months ago, one of six <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, firefighters killed when they responded to a fire unaware the burning trailer contained 50,000 pounds of highly explosive ammonium nitrate. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> says he has a kidney infection and lung cancer he blames on exposure to radiation during his 27 years working at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> nuclear facility in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> are among thousands due to participate Friday in `` Workers Memorial Day,'' when labor unions plan more than 100 events in 37 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to highlight safety issues in a month of anniversaries of milestones and tragedies in job safety. `` I think it's important to remember the workers who have been hurt and killed in the line of duty,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` Maybe this type of thing can stop it before it gets worse.'' One of the events will be in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, marking the first anniversary of the death of flight attendant C.B. <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, who vanished 24,000 feet above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> on April 28, 1988, when the roof of <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 243 ripped open. In <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a ceremony will honor the 28 construction workers killed two years ago this month in a building collapse. Friday was chosen because it is the 19th anniversary of the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The events, organizers say, will highlight what they see as the shortcomings of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and its accomplishments and serve as a reminder that an estimated 10,000 people a year are killed on the job. That estimate does not include those who die of job-related diseases or suffer non-fatal injuries at work. According to government figures, jobs in mining, transportation, construction and agriculture carry the highest risk of fatal injury, with unguarded machinery, trench cave-ins, electrocution and motor vehicle accidents responsible for the largest number of deaths. `` If we are to do honor to the thousands of working men and women who have sacrificed life and limb on the job, then we must redouble our efforts to enact stronger and more effective laws,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who will attend the memorial service for the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> firefighters Friday. `` We will fight until the day when the spilling of workers' blood at the job site is nothing more than a memory.'' A study released Thursday by a private <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research group supports some of labor's criticisms of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>. The agency, considered by labor leaders to be short-staffed, lost one-third of its inspectors to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration budget cuts, fails to coordinate criminal investigations with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, levies fines so small they serve as no deterrent to worker-safety abuses and lacks the necessary police authority to halt unsafe practices, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said. It said it interviewed more than 125 prosecutors, private attorneys, labor, industry officials and government officials and others. The 1.2 million-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees has rallies planned in 30 cities to point out what it considers another flaw of <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>: it does not cover public-sector employees. Some of the tragedies being remembered were highly publicized. Others received little attention. In <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, demonstrators will read a roll of former workers at an asbestos plant whose deaths allegedly were linked to exposure to the product; in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators will join workers to discuss hazards in the meatpacking industry. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is organizing about a dozen of the events; its member unions dozens more, from northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to the memorial service for Lansing in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, bus drivers will pull into the nearest stop to honor a one-minute moment of silence and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> will lead a special labor Mass honoring workers killed on the job, including two track workers struck by a train March 30.

<HEAD>Suggetion to Remove Lenin's Body From Mausoleum Creates Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A stage director has caused a furor reaching all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by suggesting on live TV that <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body be removed from the mausoleum on Red Square and buried. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s mausoleum at the Kremlin Wall is visited by millions of Soviets every year, reflecting the reverence in which the Soviet founder still is held. Two candidate members of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, speaking at a meeting Tuesday, criticized the suggestion by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Leninsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zakharov </PERSON> said on the weekly discussion program `` Vzglad'' that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s body should be removed from the mausoleum where it has been kept since his death in 1924 and buried. The mausoleum, he and other speakers said, should be turned into a monument to the Soviet founder without his body. `` Vzglad'' is one of the most outspoken and popular shows on Soviet TV, and the April 21 live show was broadcast only hours after official TV carried a Kremlin ceremony marking <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s 119th birthday. `` To repeat these kinds of questions is, it seems to me, simply immoral,'' said <PERSON> Ratmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobovikov </PERSON>, regional party leader in <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>. `` Literally the next morning people began calling the party committee and in disbelieve asking, ` How are we supposed to understand this? Whose point of view is this?''' he said. Another Central Committee member criticized the show for broadcasting the comments. `` Why does our television _ state, party television _ permit such statements?'' said <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhukov </PERSON>, a candidate <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who retired at Tuesday's meeting. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aksenov </PERSON>, director of the state radio and television committee, said `` Vzglad'' was `` a live broadcast and no one expected anything like it.'' He indicated that editors face disciplinary action for the broadcast. Although `` Vzglad'' is one of the most popular shows on Soviet TV, its editors have been chastised more than once for the viewpoints expressed on the show, he said. Even under the greater openness of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> is rarely criticized. On major state holidays, May Day and Revolution Day, the Soviet leadership stands atop the mausoleum to review parades. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupskaya </PERSON>, bitterly opposed interment of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> in an above-ground mausoleum where his body could be viewed, but she was overruled by the party leaders, including <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died in 1953, his body was placed in the mausoleum, but it was removed in 1961 after Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> began a liberalization campaign and a re-evaluation of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s `` cult of personality.''

 Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said Thursday he underestimated the problem of protecting <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s disappearing coastal marshes, which are vanishing at the rate of about an acre every 15 minutes <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> loses 30 to 50 square miles of its coastal marshes each year. The wetlands support a billion-dollar seafood industry and serve as the winter home for about 5 million migratory birds. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was here for a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>; he also visited an offshore drilling rig. `` At first, I thought that all we needed to do was put riprp and down the coast,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said. `` And then someone explained to me that was not possible.'' For one thing, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 400 miles of coastline translates to almost 7,000 miles of shoreline when the bays, inlets and peninsulas are included. Solid objects also tend to sink in the marshy soil of the shoreline. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, with 40 percent of the nation's coastal wetlands, suffers 80 percent of the annual loss. Most of the loss is due to industrialization along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which robs the marshes of the fresh water and silt that used to renew them. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said the `` no net loss'' policy proclaimed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably ca n't be interpreted to mean that an acre of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marsh must be reclaimed for every acre lost.

<HEAD>Vietnam Returns 21 Sets of Remains to U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday returned 21 sets of remains believed to be those of Americans killed in the Vietnam War, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said they expected talks soon on further repatriations of the dead. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said the two countries were `` cooperating fruitfully'' to solve humanitarian issues arising from the long, bloody conflict. The resolution of the missing in action issue and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> have been the prime obstacles to normalization of ties between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> A dispatch from the official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the remains were turned over to a representative of the Hawaii-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the military unit tasked with resolving the fates of more than 2,300 MIAs from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> conflict. According to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesmen, a team from the center was to have picked up the remains in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport, then take them to army laboratories in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis. The Vietnamese report did not provide details but said the Americans `` highly appreciated the humanitarian policy, goodwill and cooperation'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official sources, who asked not to be identified, said talks on more repatrations were likely to take place in the near future. There are 1,730 Americans still listed as missing in action in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, while 634 others are missing in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The war ended in 1975 with communist victories over U.S.-backed governments in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. A 20-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military flew to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Thursday aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-131 transport to pick up the remains. The team, headed by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, was due to arrive in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Friday after an overnight stop in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>. Counting Thursday's repatriation, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned 184 sets of remains since 1987, when it was agreed to accelerate cooperation in exchange for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military says that of those remains returned since mid-1987, 45 have been positively identified as those of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen killed in the conflict. A team of 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military specialists has been in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since April 12, working with Vietnamese in the fifth joint investigation on MIAs. They are interviewing villagers who saw plane crashes and seeking other evidence of the missing men. The investigators will work until April 30 in the longest such project thus far. American experts believe that while other remains will probably be found, a total resolution of all on the MIA roster is impossible given the corrosive tropical climate, difficult terrain and the fact that many died at sea. The lack of diplomatic relations between the onetime enemies has hampered progress on the MIA and other humanitarian issues. But <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> announced April 5 that it will withdraw all of its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by Sept. 30, and progress on the MIA resolution has been substantial. `` At present, the Vietnam-U.S. relationship is not good but it is better than that during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aggression against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` The two countries are cooperating fruitfully in the settlement of humanitarian issues of both sides,'' he said. `` We are prepared to look forward.'' <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, who is seeking to expand ties with the non-communist world, said normal relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` benefit both sides as well as peace and stability in the region.''

 Health experts told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday that Third World methods could help reduce infant mortality rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Approximately 40,000 infants die each year'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gude </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> businesswoman who serves as secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, a group that aimes to foster cooperation among the nations in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. She said health workers in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are used to making do with little money and to dealing with poor people. She cited a card that Brazilian communities give new mothers to keep track of their children's weight and vaccinations. Babies who die soon after birth are often underweight. `` A simple device like this has made a big impact on educational programs in other countries and we believe it can help us reduce our own infant mortality rates here in the states,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Gude </PERSON> and others testified to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on hunger. Dr. <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> testified in favor of the cure now widespread in poor countries for diarrhea in babies: a simple mixture of water, sugar or glucose and salt that can be drunk. Such an oral rehydration treatment using `` rice powder in place of glucose is palatable and helps slow diarrhea,'' he said. He said the standard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treatment for dehydration, the loss of body fluids, is to give replacement fluids intravenously. But this treatment is expensive and not always available outside hospitals. <PERSON> Hirschhorn </PERSON> is vice president of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snow </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> a consulting firm. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the committee's domestic task force, said diarrhea annually kills about 500 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children under age five Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, estimated that oral rehydration saves 750,000 to a million lives every year in the Third World. Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could learn from other countries about immunizing pre-school children against measles and whooping cough. `` Coverage for measles'' for children under age two in some large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan areas `` has been documented to be as low as 49 percent,'' he testified. `` This is lower than in many nations of the developing world. ...'' Dr. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> directs the field services division of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.

 Republicans breathed easier Thursday after <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' solid victory in a hotly contested congressional race in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, but Democrats still claimed `` a lot of momentum'' from the three special elections during <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days as president. `` We feel good about two out of three,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. After a 40-day campaign marked by heavy involvement by both national parties, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> defeated Democrat <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> on Wednesday for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat given up by Republican <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> when he was appointed secretary of defense. Unofficial returns gave <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> 74,258 votes, or 52 percent, to <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s 60,821 votes, or 43 percent. There were few claims that the contest had any broad national importance, with most analysts concluding merely that as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> goes, so goes <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` It's a strain to try to come up with anything of national significance,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of governmental studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unlike the Democrats, who like to beat their breasts and claim national implications in every special election, we will simply say that in this one the best man won,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that the Democrats won the first two special <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> elections this year and he said a victory in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> would have been `` like winning the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery.'' `` It's the first thing after a presidential election where the Republicans win and are feeling pretty full of themselves and we come in and the first three tests do real well,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The possibility that the Democrats might make it three in a row had Republicans feeling on edge early in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> campaign, despite the fact Republicans outnumber Democrats three-to-two among the state's registered voters. `` It's like getting a big ball and chain cut,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> of the returns from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` I think we have a lot of momentum coming out of this series of three special elections,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schloss </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee. The president did not campaign in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Any possibility that he might was quashed when out-of-state involvement became in issue on both sides. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s landslide victory over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November _ the fifth <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victory in the last six presidential elections _ Republicans set their sights on diminishing if not ending Democratic dominance of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The battle was joined early with a special election last month in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to fill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Democrat <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> was the upset victor after a campaign in which she tagged her GOP opponent as soft on taxes, a theme often used against Democrats by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates. In a second special election one week later in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, the Democrats held a seat by a landslide margin, dashing Republican hopes for a show of strength in the Deep South. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, who had signed on with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee at a fee of $ 250,000 a year, proclaimed the stakes were high in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and said the campaign was `` something I've had my hands on since day one.'' Democrat <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> immediately started running ads talking about `` outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consultants'' taking control of the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> countered with ads saying that 80 percent of <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON>'s campaign money came from out-of-state labor unions The Democrat started the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> campaign with a big edge over <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in name recognition. Five months earlier, <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> had come within 1,322 votes of upsetting Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagt </PERSON> chided the Democrats for running a Willie Horton-style campaign that accused <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of being soft on criminals. `` It was not a pleasant campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he planned to study polling results to determine the impact of the negative ads run in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` It's too early to tell,'' he said. In the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeded in tagging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as soft on crime by citing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program and particularly the case of <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a convict who left while on furlough and raped a woman in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinich </PERSON> ran ads accusing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of being soft on criminals by voting for legislation that allowed certain felons to serve sentences in county jails rather than the state prison. The ads were criticized by many Democrats who pointed out that the legislation passed both chambers of the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> with only three dissenting votes and then was signed by a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor.

 Some townspeople wo n't claim folk singer <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> as a native son, while others say the town has n't done enough to capitalize on the Dust Bowl balladeer and lure tourists whizzing past on Interstate 40 The decades-old argument is raised anew this week because <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON>, is giving a benefit concert Saturday at <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>'s venerable Crystal Theatre. It will be <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s first performance in his father's hometown `` I do n't feel an obligation to push my dad on anyone,'' the younger <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` His work, his life can stand on its own. Time and history have spoken for him. Now, I can relax a bit and just have fun with his music and just be my dad's kid.'' Theater owner <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said he has sold out the 698-seat theater at $ 10 a ticket, but he said many of those attending will be from out of town. `` I would n't go across the street to hear it,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> resident since 1931. `` I'm not for it at all, and I'm against it.'' Detractors call <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, whose songs included `` This Land is Your Land,'' a Communist and a `` militant atheist.'' Supporters say he was a patriot and a defender of the downtrodden. `` If you'd read what <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> wrote, you'd know how he felt,'' said <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgmon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION>. Last week, local funeral home director <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s son, placed a poster outside the downtown American Legion hall proclaiming `` Woody Was No Hero. A local newspaper reporter who tore it down faces municipal charges. For years, a town water tower has proclaimed to traffic on I-40 that <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s home. But when the ramshackle house <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> lived in until he left <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> at age 17 began falling down, locals let it go. Its pieces are stored for possible future restoration. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was born 76 years ago in this central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> town of 3,300. He died in 1967 at age 55 of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s chorea, a hereditary degenerative disorder. There are no monuments to him in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. His ashes were scattered over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> denied he was a Communist, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Un-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that focused on entertainers in the 1950s did n't call him to testify. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tulsa </ORGANIZATION> professor who has lectured about <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> and performed his music for years, noted that <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. `` Woody was outspoken. He was a radical in a lot of ways and controversial,'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said. `` Most people never considered <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> a threat to the security of this nation. `` <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> was very patriotic. All you have to do is look at his songs.'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> wrote more than 1,000 songs, including classics such as `` So Long, It's Been Good to Know You.'' Many have become folk standards. He led a vagabond existence after leaving <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>, writing and performing about what he saw in migrant worker camps from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. His songs railed against the abuses of the poor. <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> native, guessed that the town's residents are `` 80 percent pro-Woody.'' `` But the little core group that are against <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> are pretty vocal,'' he said. `` Two or three people, they speak out against <PERSON> Woody </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>. `` Then there has been the right-wing element, it has always circulated things quietly against <PERSON> Woody </PERSON>. `` There will always be those who do n't like <PERSON> Woody </PERSON>, and do n't know why Woody liked <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>. He was proud of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>. He loved both places. He did n't always paint a pretty picture, because he wrote what he experienced.'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> would not have been surprised by the debate. `` He would enjoy the controversy and would laugh,'' he said. `` He had the ability to laugh at himself and laugh at life.''

 A trouble-free countdown gave <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers some breathing room today as preparations proceeded toward Friday's midafternoon launch of Atlantis and five astronauts. The mission will propel a probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on the first space shuttle planetary mission. `` We're ready to go fly,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, the former astronaut who has been nominated as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. The <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, ready for its 15-month flight to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, `` is in good shape,'' said <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist. After an 11-year hiatus in deep space exploration, he said, `` No one is going to question our leadership in planetary -LRB- flight -RRB- again.'' Officials called it their smoothest countdown in 29 shuttle missions. `` We just do n't have anything out there that we're worried about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue that way,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> spoke as the countdown was halted for 15-hours, 34 minutes. The hold was planned to allow for any catchup work in case of problems, but <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said there were none. As the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> crew prepared for its four-day flight, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> today, leaving the Mir space station unmanned for the first time in more than two years. Three of the cosmonauts had been in orbit for five months, the third for eight months. When the Atlantis count resumes shortly before midnight, the launch team will make preparation to begin loading more than 500,000 gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tanks. The only concern, and it was slight, was the possibility of crosswinds of more than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Shuttle managers assessed all facets of the flight during a day-long meeting Wednesday and reported, `` all preparations are progressing satisfactorily. There are no technical or programmatic issues. ... Weather is expected to be good.'' Liftoff of the 29th shuttle mission and the fourth since the Challenger explosion three years ago is set for 2:24 p.m. Friday. The launch team will have only a 23-minute period in which to get the shuttle off the ground because of the need to deploy the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe from a precise point in space and the requirement that liftoff occur before darkness falls on emergency landing sites in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. The astronauts were to review flight plans and make efficiency runs in jet aircraft today. They are commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. Late Friday, about six hours after liftoff, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and Cleave will release <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the cargo bay and an hour later a rocket will hurl the 7,600-pound payload on a 450-day voyage to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface with a high resolution radar system. Its images should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about the size of a football field. This is 10 times sharper than any previous pictures of the planet. `` All our previous data from <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> has been low resolution and about all that data has done is tell us basically there are continent-size mountain masses on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and that there are extensive rolling plains,'' Magellan project scientist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said Friday. `` We do n't know whether <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> ever had oceans, we do n't know how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> rids itself of its internal heat, and we do n't know if <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is still volcanically active,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s goal is to answer these questions and improve on our knowledge of the geophysical and geological properties of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and the nature of processes that shape its surface.'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said the images could help scientists understand how <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its sister planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> evolved so differently, even though they basically were identical when formed at the beginning of the solar system. The surface temperature on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide and a thick cloud of sulfuric acid drops. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project manager, said the $ 550 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> mission will mark `` the beginning of a big year for the planetary program.'' `` In August the Voyager spacecraft will fly by <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and in October we'll launch <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> to Jupiter,'' he told reporters Wednesday. `` So after an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious to get started,'' he said `` We have our team in place.. and the butterflies are soon to arrive.'' The last planetary mission launched by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the 1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take the first closeup look at distant <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in August after earlier exploring Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus.

<HEAD>Weak Consumer Spending, Strong Income Gain Boost Savings Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday that consumer spending rose a slim 0.2 percent in March, its weakest performance in six months and a sign, analysts said, that consumers are contributing to an economic slowdown. The sluggish spending came even as personal income rose a strong 0.8 percent. That combination boosted the personal savings rate to its highest level in nearly four years, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Analysts said Thursday's reports provided new confirmation that the economic acceleration is slowing and that consumers are helping apply the brakes. `` It is consistent with this view of the wary consumer, of consumers not being sure that their paychecks are going to stretch to cover the rising costs of things in their budgets,'' said economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Personal income in March rose sharply to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.35 trillion after advances of 1 percent in February and 1.7 percent in January. Personal spending, meanwhile, edged up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.39 trillion after gains of 0.5 percent in February and 0.7 percent in January. Last month's 0.2 percent advance was the weakest performance since spending held steady in September. With the advances in income consistently outstripping the gains in spending, the personal savings rate has been edging up and in March hit 6.3 percent, the highest level since it was at 6.4 percent in May 1985. The savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ has been on the increase since it hit a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987. Last year, the savings rate was 4.2 percent. In January, it was 5.1 percent; in February, 5.8 percent. Analysts cautioned, however, that the savings rate has been inflated in recent months by strong farm income and slower sales of autos and other expensive items that have a disproportionate effect on the rate. The March increase in personal income was due partly to special factors, including profit-sharing payments to auto workers, a big increase in retroactive Social Security benefits and farm subsidies. Even excluding those factors, however, income rose a solid 0.6 percent. The weakness in spending was concentrated in purchases of durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years. Spending on durables declined 1.5 percent last month, largely due to slow auto sales. Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.4 percent; spending on services advanced 0.5 percent. With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, any slowing trend there can be widely felt However, economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said that so far in the slowdown, `` consumers are contributing a little bit ... but they're not the main reason.'' Added <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` A major slowdown in consumer spending can tip the economy into a recession, but I do n't think it's going to be consumers who will do that.'' Many analysts expect smaller advances in exports and business investment to play a big role in slowing the economy this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to relieve inflationary pressures by restraining economic growth. More information about inflation became available Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter while prices of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods sold overseas advanced 1.4 percent. Data Resources economist <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> said the increases are `` consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a whole are getting close to full capacity'' at their factories, a condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks that drive up prices. <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> said it will take some time `` for the tightening of monetary policy in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and in other industrialized countries to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on the inflation rate.'' On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer spending for the first quarter overall rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent after adjusting for inflation, down from 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 1988 and the slowest pace in more than a year. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villamil </PERSON>, the department's chief economist, said the economic pattern of the first quarter _ slower consumer spending accompanied by increased exports and business investment _ was `` a desirable one for the sustainability of the economic expansion.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is projecting a 2.0 percent increase in real personal spending this year, down from 3.7 percent in 1988.

 A clerical error caused <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to fail to follow federal requirements in inspecting the cargo door that blew off the jumbo jetliner two months later, killing nine people, the company said today. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> vice president for technical services, told federal investigators Wednesday the airline was unaware it had to inspect the locking mechanism after the cargo door was repaired Dec. 23 in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Doll clarified his statement today, saying a partial inspection was made. Although it was not as thorough as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> required, company repairmen were satisfied the door was operating properly, he said. Company officials stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 door had been inspected in November 1988, three months before the accident, and no problems were found. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> engineer testified today that the plane manufacturer had no idea why on Feb. 24, the door and part of the fuselage tore off as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 was climbing to 23,000 feet 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineering manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> the company had made no projections about the effects of a cargo-door loss. `` The doors are not designed to come off the airplane,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` We had no way of knowing exactly what would happen if a door came open in flight.'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> refused to speculate on how the accident happened. He came under extensive questioning from Capt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, who criticized <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that the door is safe in the wake of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> accident and a 1987 incident when a door partly opened in mid-flight on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight `` We can not explain the Pan American incident and we have the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> accident where the door failed, but we steadfastly are saying the door is safe,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. He also noted that the two known failures of 747 cargo doors both involved forward cargo doors, and advised the company to study why. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is looking at ways to improve the warning system to ensure the cargo doors are closed before takeoff, but has not determined what to do or even if changes in the present systms are necessary. Doll's testimony Wednesday came during a day when <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials were grilled about the operation and maintenance of the 800-pound cargo doors. Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking mechanism of the cargo door, which remains on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with 337 passengers and a crew of 18. After the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> incident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> proposed new rules requiring that lock mechanisms of all 747s be visually inspected for signs of wear by July 31, 1988, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>. United inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also required that aluminum parts of locking mechanisms be reinforced with steel, which <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> also began to perform. But a clerical error caused the company to miss a third requirement regarding cargo doors that had been opened and closed manually because of a problem with the electrical system. That requirement was that once those doors were repaired, they had to be reinspected for damage, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. A clerk who retyped the message from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the aircraft manufacturer, into <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s internal communication system apparently dropped six key words, Doll told the board. The note, with the words that were dropped in parentheses, read: `` The special procedures ... for manual door operation must be continued and performed prior to takeoff following each operation of the door until electrical restoration -LRB- and operations are resumed and reinspection -RRB- of the lock sectors has been accomplished ... `` `` It was a clerical error,'' <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The cargo door of the 747 developed electrical problems during flights over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in December 1988, and the door was operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, company officials said. Doll told investigators he would like to see the door raised from 17,000 feet of water, but the safety board has made no decision on that yet. Doll also said he is unconvinced the locking machanism was the culprit because <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has had no similar problems. He told investigators the 747 did not have a history of unusual cargo door problems, and that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> recorded 112 problems with forward and aft cargo doors in all of its 747s from March 1986 to February 1989. Eight of those were on the ill-fated plane, he said.

<HEAD>Committee Passes Budget, Takeshita One Step Closer to Leaving Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing party broke with tradition, defied an opposition boycott and rushed the budget through a parliamentary committee Thursday, indicating Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will leave office soon. Also on Thursday, an advisory board recommended an overhaul of political fund-raising regulations to avoid the type of conflict of interest and influence-peddling charges that destroyed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s career A separate panel urged all lawmakers be banned from stock trading, make public disclosures of their assets and stop traditional gifts of money at funeral and weddings. Under intense political pressure, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took responsibility Tuesday for a bribery and influence-peddling scandal and said he will resign after final passage of the budget. That has prompted the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to rush legislation through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> over an opposition boycott and despite <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional emphasis on consensus. The party-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the lower house rammed through approval of the budget in one minute Thursday, and party leaders are expected to push the issue through the full lower house on Friday. That means <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> apparently will step down in May. The budget automatically goes into effect within 30 days of lower house approval if not rejected by the upper house. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have a majority in both houses. Opposition party leaders denounced the rushed committee vote as an act of desperation. `` This outrage treads parliamentary democracy under foot and can not be forgiven,'' said lawmaker <PERSON> Shun </PERSON> <PERSON> Oide </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the leading opposition party. The budget action `` is the final act of political hari-kari for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>,'' said political analyst and author <PERSON> Asao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>. `` He is offering himself as a sacrifice, but this will just increase the people's distrust of the Liberal Democrats.'' The opposition has boycotted budget debate, demanding new parliamentary elections and a broad investigation of the scandal surrounding the purchase by business and political leaders of unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information and publishing conglomerate. The shares soared in value when they went on the market. Prosecutors contend at least some of the stock transactions amounted to bribery by Recruit to try to influence government policy. Fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges. The company also made huge political donations. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> acknowledged receiving more than $ 1 million in donations. While a panel of the prime minister recommended new rules on fund-raising, another panel of members of the private and academic sectors recommended widespread changes in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s big-money politics, including requiring all legislators to disclose their assets and stop traditional monetary gifts. Only Cabinet members now must divulge their assets. There are no restrictions on lawmakers or their staff speculating on stocks, and politicians routinely spend huge sums on wedding and funeral offerings to their constituents. Analysts say <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and a former foreign minister, will likely replace <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and lead a caretaker government <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> told reporters Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> _ <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s main lieutenant _ asked him early Thursday to accept <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s job. Later Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> received the backing of his party faction, headed by former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> has insisted he will not accept the post due to a heart condition caused by diabetes. Many analysts say his public denials are a facade. `` It would be un-Japanese for him to come out and say he'll take the job,'' said <PERSON> Keiichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, an aide to former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> will accept once `` the proper atmosphere has been created.'' The party was shocked Wednesday by the suicide of a <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> aide who handled the prime minister's political funds. Stock dealings and a $ 384,000 loan from Recruit were carried out in the name of the aide, <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> was among more than a dozen politicians and political aides who profited from Recruit stock. More than 150 political, business and media figures purchased such shares.

<TEXT>
 About 20,000 striking workers and students clashed with riot police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and seven other cities Thursday, and dissidents planned weekend demonstrations in defiance of a government ban. About 10,000 striking workers from 12 plants fought police with rocks and firebombs in the southeastern industrial city of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, demanding the release of jailed strike leaders. In the nearby port of <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION>, about 3,000 workers also clashed with police, demanding pay increases and the release of strike leaders. Protesters set fire to a governing office and threw rocks at several police posts. About 1,000 students in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> clashed with police after a campus rally at which they burned effigies of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Police officials said two riot troopers had been seriously injured in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, but they had no further details. It was not known immediately if there were any workers injured or arrested. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, an estimated 4,500 students hulring rocks and firebombs battled police at three universities in support of striking workers and scheduled border talks between students of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 10,000 students at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> boycotted classes and held an anti-government campus rally, denouncing alleged government suppression of labor movement. `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>,'' students shouted, shooting clenched fists into the sky. After the student rally, about 3,000 tried to march into the streets, hurling rocks and firebombs. Police fired tear gas to drive them back. No injuries or arrests were reported. Campus clashes were also reported in <LOCATION> Anyang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chunchon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chongju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>. Student leaders said they will march to the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> Friday for talks with North Korean students on uniting the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula and taking part in an international youth festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in July. Authorities outlawed the march and said police would block it. Last year, several marches for unification were blocked by police. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the main dissident alliance, said they would hold a labor rally Sunday in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> despite a government ban and said police would be responsible for any violence. About 30 labor leaders were arrested in police raids in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Thursday as the government moved against radical labor groups, police said. Those arrested face charges of staging illegal strikes, they said. The radical students have been staging almost daily violent protests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. The radicals and allied dissident groups lack widespread popular support and are not seen as a threat to the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government. But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay and improved working conditions. Student and dissident groups are attempting to unite with workers to build an anti-government alliance. Dissident leaders claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule and demand the former general step down. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won a December 1987 election after rival opposition candidates split the opposition vote.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has arrived to help in an assault on gummed-up beaches and bays, more than doubling cleanup efforts five weeks after the nation's worst oil spill fouled Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. After loading workers and supplies in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> was anchored today near <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> as part of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s state-guided effort to clean rocky beaches where seals and sea lions have their pups. `` The <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> allows us to accelerate the pace of the cleanup. That's key,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. The top state environmental official today disputed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of how the cleanup is going, saying more study was needed before concluding that just 10 percent of the oil remained unaccounted-for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had stated that 17 percent of the spilled oil had been recovered and 73 percent has dissipated. `` It's important for our credibility we want to make sure we take all the steps necessary to make an assessment, even if <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> is willing to go out on a limb and provide you with figures that may be both gross and inaccurate,'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s environmental commissioner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. The state also revised its estimate of the total amount of oil spilled downward, to 10.9 million gallons from 11.2 million gallons. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of the oil spill remains 10.1 million gallons. The arrival of the <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> could spell good news for marine mammals in the sound, where the most heavily oiled beaches are. `` The ship carries nine landing craft,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said of the <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. `` Each will be equipped by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> with pumps and heaters, enabling the company to transport crews to work areas more quickly. The crew will just stay out there.'' The landing transport is carrying 400 workers who were to get off each morning and return to sleep at night. About 250 workers who had been cleaning <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> today moved to <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Most of them sleep on barges nearby. After three days of 15-to-20-foot seas and gale-force winds whipping snow in some areas, skimmers returned to work Wednesday in the sound and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Today's forecast called for light rain and wind, and seas of three feet. Confirmed reports have placed the oil at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, 275 miles west of where the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24 in a picturesque area rich in marine life. Neither Exxon, which conducts daily overflights of the area, nor the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> could confirm a report by a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer that oil was spotted 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Kashvik </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The spreading oil sheen has crept into energy politics as well as the coves that make up Kenai Fjords National Park 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. A letter to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released Wednesday by Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to buy back oil exploration leases sold for <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, an area <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said produces $ 1 billion a year in seafood. `` Alaskans already have had to face the closure of this year's multimillion-dollar Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> herring fishery and black cod fishery, and the attendant loss of jobs and community stability,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> wrote `` The spector of such an event in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is unthinkable,'' <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> said. `` It is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid money.'' But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> to a joint session of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, warned that the nation must not retreat from oil exploration because of the spill. `` We are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup effort,'' he said. `` We are working with industry to develop an improved plan in the event of a future spill. `` But shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer, and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. To avoid that, `` we must return to high levels of exploratory drilling.'' While some wildlife has moved out of oiled areas, bald eagles and other scavengers have been drawn to it, said <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiglitz </PERSON>, regional director for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Steiglitz </PERSON> said in a news release that eagles and gulls that have moved in to feed on the carrion will become `` secondary victims of the oil by contamination through the food chain.'' Four eagles have been reported dead.

<HEAD>Watkins Discloses New Delay In Restart Of Weapons Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said Thursday he has moved back the timetable for resuming production of a scarce gas needed to make nuclear warheads. He assured <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the delay would not weaken the national defense. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he hoped to restart production at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, early in 1990. The three reactors, which have been plagued by safety and technical flaws, are the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable, radioactive gas that boosts the explosive power of warheads. More retraining of reactor operators and a fuller assessment of other safety issues are needed before the plant can be allowed to resume operation, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. `` Because of the attention I'm giving to safety, health and the environment, ... I have said unequivocally I will not allow them to be started this year'' as previously planned, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told reporters at a meeting in his office. Shortly after the reactors were shut down for safety reasons last summer, the department said it could have them running again by late 1988. After that target was missed, the department told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it expected startup by late this year. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> also disclosed in a meeting with reporters that he planned to announce a `` new approach'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s controversial effort to build the nation's first permanent repository for high-level nuclear wastes in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> He said residents of the state may have been justified in feeling `` they had a waste dump jammed down their throats'' by federal officials who paid too little attention to local opinion. The $ 30 billion <ORGANIZATION> Yucca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> repository is officially scheduled to open in 2003, although <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' planned changes could put that date in doubt. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which builds and tests nuclear weapons for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, has been able to continue warhead production because it has a reserve of tritium. The size of the tritium stockpile is classified, but the department told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year that supplies would be sqeezed if the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors were not operating by the end of this year. Many private groups that monitor the government weapons program have expressed doubt that tritium supplies are as tight as suggested by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The initial suggestion that we faced a national security emergency is absurd,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, S.C.-based environmental group that wants the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors closed permanently. She said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' new timetable for the reactors was overly optimistic. `` I do n't believe they will be able to restart them even by early 1990,'' she said. In a letter sent Thursday to the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> armed services committees, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he believed the reactors could be safely restarted `` early enough in 1990 to maintain a viable weapons stockpile.'' He said he had told <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of the delayed startup on Monday. In his comments to reporters, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the department and its <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> field office face a tough test in getting the reactors started in time to meet tritium needs. `` The race will be a close race, but it can be done,'' he said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he was moving ahead with a broad strategy for weeding out safety, technical and managerial problems at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reactors. He said this was central to his overall plan for restoring the credibility of nuclear power. `` I see in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> an opportunity to make it the flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, rather than the butt of criticism,'' he said. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> will go to the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant Friday in his first visit to the department's nuclear weapons production network, which includes 16 major plants in 12 states. He said he wanted to `` boost the troops' morale,'' damaged by months of critical reports about the safety and efficiency of plant operations.

 When a barred door slammed shut behind convicted killer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> on the steamy row of identical cells known simply as J-23, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'s death row became the largest in the nation. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, whose white prison suit bears an orange tag with his name and the number `` DR 932,'' is the 300th person on death row in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> statistics this week. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which in recent years has held the largest number of convicted killers awaiting execution, this week has 299 death row inmates, according to <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a pretty good indication that the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> support the death penalty if they keep sending people there,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dusek </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> also leads the nation in the number of people put to death since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 allowed capital punishment to resume. Thirty men have been given lethal injection at the Walls Unit in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, starting with <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> in December 1982. By that time, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had 130 others awaiting the same fate as <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. During the early 1980s, death row grew by about two per month. As the pace of executions quickened, so did the number of people awaiting death. In 1986, 43 new inmates joined the ranks while 10 were executed. An additional 36 came the next year, and the three-per-month average continues now. But while death row in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has grown _ it now incorporates five prison wings _ the number of executions has fallen. Only three were put to death last year and just one so far in 1989 as inmates' attorneys have won <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review of cases `` The way it's growing, they can dedicate half the farm to death row in the next five years, unless they do away with the death penalty,'' says <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>, awaiting execution for a killing spree in which three members of a family died in 1984. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>, who has been on the row since 1976 and is among the most senior of all inmates, fears a legal breakthrough will trigger many executions. `` The water is building up behind the dam,'' <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> says. `` And if they let the dam overflow or if they remove the dam, then there's going to be a flood.'' For <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 42, a self-described jack-of-all-trades who was convcted in February of the 1985 slaying of his wife's former husband, in what authorities said was an attempt to collect the man's insurance, the move to death row was his fourth trip to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison system. Included among his terms was a two-year stint for robbery which kept him behind bars for just one week before he was released. Death row, he says, is different. `` It's a title we have and under that title we're supposed to be dangerous,'' he said in an interview this week. `` But Lord knows a lot of people here are not dangerous. I'm not saying all _ but some.'' Vega, from <LOCATION> Luling </LOCATION>, says he misses `` freedom, my family, women, money, breathing the fresh air and just being able to raise my hands and say ` I'm free!''' But the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prison system, mandated by federal court orders this decade to improve prison conditions and inmate rights, is a much better place now, <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> says. One prison beating in the old days left him with a severed tendon that has left the little finger of his left hand immobile. `` Most officials I have encountered have been nice so far,'' he says. `` If you have a question, they will answer. Since the time I've been back here, <ORGANIZATION> TDC </ORGANIZATION> has not bothered me at all. It's good.''

<HEAD>Congressional Investigator Says EPA Officials Weakened Draft Report</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials weakened a task force's draft report that had presented a `` damning picture'' of the agency's program to protect groundwater from chemical contamination, a congressional investigator said Thursday. The diluted final report minimized <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s troubles in monitoring leakage from hazardous waste dumps, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON>, director of the environmental protection section of the General Accounting Office. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is an investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A separate `` Superfund'' program is for cleanup of abandoned disposal sites, sometimes in cases where responsible parties can not be located. <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON> said the problem involving leaks from hazardous waste dumps into groundwater supplies `` could be as big'' as the waste problem which Superfund handles. In testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s investigations subcommittee, <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, a private, pro-environmental advocacy group, criticized changes made by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials in the draft report <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON> said an accurate picture of the groundwater monitoring and protection program is crucial because `` over 70 percent of the facilities are leaking'' and `` about one-half the nation's population depends on groundwater for drinking water. Hazardous waste disposal facilities are licensed to operate by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. That law controls operation and closure of the sites and requires operators to clean up spills at their expense. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> issued its final report last October on groundwater monitoring at 58 of the nation's 1,447 hazardous waste disposal facilities studied by its own task force. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> studied 50 sites. A comparison of the October report and the staff task force draft in September 1987 showed that some of the hardest-hitting staff criticism of the enforcement program was deleted. Other conclusions were softened. <PERSON> Hembra </PERSON> said while `` a lot of what you see in the way of changes was moving away from emotion-laden language,'' other deletions presented `` a pretty damning picture of the program.'' Ms. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said `` some of the best technical talent at <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> sounded an alert'' about the monitoring program, but `` it does n't seem like <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> answered the call. `` Somewhere, as it moves up through the agency, the findings seem to disappear,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` The final version of the task force report deleted the finding that most facilities are leaking. One deletion was a task force conclusion that enforcement of groundwater monitoring was so poor that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and state officials `` potentially compromise the level of protection provided to the public and the environment.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, acting assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said officials who have left the agency were responsible for the changes. He asked the committee to recognize that new officials are now in charge of the monitoring program. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has `` made progress'' but has `` a long way to go.'' The September 1987 staff report said each of the facilities it investigated had `` significant deficiencies with their ... detection monitoring systems.'' That conclusion was omitted from the final report. The earlier report said the task force found `` that while most facilities were found to have groundwater contamination, very few have any active groundwater cleanup program in progress and none of these programs meet -LRB- the law's -RRB- standards.'' The final report left out that `` most facilities'' contaminated nearby groundwater and said: `` With respect to corrective action, the task force found that of those facilities that had groundwater contamination, few had active groundwater cleanup programs in progress.'' A staff report conclusion, deleted in the final version, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> enforcement personnel and managers `` do not elicit, can not understand, or sometimes do not heed, recommendations from qualified technical personnel, which would improve the level of compliance and quality of actions.'' The draft said that `` none'' of the facilities investigated has characterized the extent of its contamination as required by law. The final version deleted the `` none,'' and said, `` The task force found ... that inadequate groundwater monitoring efforts at many sites often resulted in unsatisfactory..

 More than 100 anti-abortion demonstrators were arrested Thursday after linking arms to block the doors at the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, police said. `` They had a crowd of 250 to 350 people, and they effectively barricaded the entrance to the women's clinic,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The demonstration came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments in a case that could limit abortions. One man suffered arm and facial abrasions when he slipped from the grasp of police officers who picked him up to remove him. Most of those arrested were released soon afterward, but some refused to identify themselves and were kept in custody. The clinic reopened by noon. `` Some of our patients were delayed in getting inside the clinic, but they've all be taken care of now,'' clinic administrator <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. The protest was organized by a local group called Christians Against Abortion. It is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has staged similar demonstrations across the nation.

 Five astronauts tracked a perfect countdown Thursday as technicians prepared the shuttle Atlantis for a midafternoon launch on Friday. The mission will propel <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Magellan'' probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and revive <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s deep-space science program `` After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious to get started,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project manager. Officials described the countdown as the smoothest of four since the Challenger disaster. The chance of high winds provided slight concern as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> looked forward to liftoff in an unusually tight launch window that opens at 2:24 p.m. EDT and lasts justs 23 minutes. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, ready for its 15-month flight to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, `` is 100 percent healthy and ticking along,'' said <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist `` We're ready to go fly,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, who heads the shuttle program and is the incoming <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. Earlier Thursday, three Soviet cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, leaving the Mir space station unattended for the first time in more than two years. Two of the cosmonauts had been in space for five months, the other for eight months. Atlantis' cargo is the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft which has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and map its surface. The mission costs $ 550 million, not including the $ 225 million cost of the four-day shuttle flight. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s radar images, relayed to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and enhanced by computer, should reveal details as small as 100 yards across, about the size of a football field. That is 10 times sharper than previous pictures of the planet. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project scientist, said the radar images could help scientists understand how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of how <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> evolved so differently even though they were almost identical when the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago. The Magellan deployment is scheduled 6 hours 18 minutes after liftoff, with astronauts <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON> conducting a countdown from inside their shuttle cabin. An hour after the release, a rocket is to fire to hurl the 7,600-pound unmanned probe on a 450-day journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, a complex trip that takes <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> one and one-half times around the sun before it intercepts its target planet. The Atlantis crew also includes commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is the only one who has not flown on a previous shuttle mission. Spending cutbacks and delays forced by the 1986 Challenger accident prompted <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to use the roundabout approach to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The trip could have been made in four months under better circumstances. The first American planetary mission since 1978 will mark the beginning of a busy year for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s planetary program. `` In August the Voyager spacecraft will fly by <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and in October we'll launch Galileo -LRB- from the shuttle -RRB- to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON> said At a briefing for reporters Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> vowed, `` No one is going to question our leadership in planetary -LRB- flight -RRB- again.'' The Atlantis countdown began Tuesday and was progressing so smoothly Thursday that the launch team had time to relax during a 15-hour halt of the clock. The time had been set aside for catchup work. `` We just do n't have anything out there that we're worried about; it's been a real smooth count and we expect it to continue that way,'' said countdown director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>. Weather officers said they were keeping one eye on scattered clouds which were moving into the skies above <LOCATION> Moron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where an airbase serves as an emergency landing site in the event of a problem after launch. The astronauts were briefed throughout the day on the status of the countdown and reviewed their flight plans. They were to retire early Friday, arising about 9 a.m. to prepare for the afternoon launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after noon. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to orbit the cloud-veiled planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface during 243 Earth days, equal to one Venusian day. Low resolution pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft hint at Earth-like mountain ranges and rolling plains, but the surface temperature on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is 900 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The last planetary mission launched by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the 1978 Pioneer-Venus probe. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will take the first closeup look at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in August after earlier exploring Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. Other major science projects planned in the next three years are the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from a shuttle early next year, the Ulysses probe to study the sun in October, 1990, and the Mars Observer spacecraft in 1992.

 A tornado swept through central <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, killing 600 people and injuring 12,000 others as it flattened buildings and tossed fishing boats, government officials said Thursday. At least 200 people were missing. Wednesday evening's storm, which also unleashed hail and heavy rain, struck hours after President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> led nationwide prayers for an end to a drought that has been tormenting <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Survivors said the funnel cloud raged for 10 minutes at dusk Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, and tore down `` everything, including buildings.'' The twister capsized several fishing boats, raising fears that many of the 200 missing may have been killed. `` I saw black clouds gathering in the sky. In moments we found we were flying along with the house,'' said <PERSON> Sayeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>, a 30-year-old housewife in the village of <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>. The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the toll of 600 dead. A government doctor from the area said at least 12,000 people were injured. Troops on Thursday searched wrecked villages for survivors. In <LOCATION> Saturia </LOCATION>, a village of 10,000 people, nothing was standing for about one square mile. <PERSON> Sayeda </PERSON> said she and her husband and four children were lifted through the air by the storm. Her 5-year-old son was found two miles away, suffering from bad bruises, she said. All of them suffered injuries. In the neighboring village of <LOCATION> Nandeshwari </LOCATION>, none of the 120 houses was left standing. <PERSON> Tofael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a teacher, wept bitterly as he held a torn shirt that had been worn by his son, <PERSON> Sonal </PERSON>, hours earlier. <PERSON> Sonal </PERSON> and his sister, <PERSON> Sufia </PERSON> <PERSON> Beagum </PERSON>, were among the missing. `` What shall I do with this shirt? Why Allah should curse me like this!'' he cried. Another tornado hit <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION> district, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, killing five people and injuring 500 others, news reports said. The New Nation newspaper said about 200,000 people were affected by the tornadoes as thousands of mud-and-straw houses were swept away. Most of the survivors have no shelter and camped in fields under fresh rains Thursday. Relief Minister <PERSON> Sirajul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoosain </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said the government had rushed food and medicine to the survivors and was setting up makeshift camps. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> appealed for blood donations, and <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> flew to the affected areas in <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Narsingdi </LOCATION>. Before the storms, more than 75,000 people joined <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> in a service at the national prayer ground in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to pray for rain. Two months of drought had threatened to destroy more than half the rice crop in this poverty-stricken nation. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the world's poorest countries with a per capita annual income of $ 160, alternates between flood and drought. Agriculture is the main occupation of most of its 110 million people.

 To shave, or not to shave? For bearded politicians facing an election fight, that's the question. Either way, they say, it's risky business. Conservative Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif., sprouted flaming red chin whiskers last year but shaved them off for the November election He easily won a sixth House term. But when liberal former Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, D-Wash., shaved off his `` <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> look-alike'' beard last fall in his bid for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, he lost Another GOP conservative from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, freshman Rep. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, ignored his media experts' advice and refused to shave his beard. The voters elected him anyway. `` I got letters, mostly from older people, saying, ` I like your ideas but you look like a tramp,''' said <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, who had written speeches for then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` But I figure I gained much more support by keeping my beard. It helped me stand out from the eight other primary candidates, who all looked alike.'' <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON> is one of only five remaining members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, an informal group that convened one morning this week in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> barber shop to celebrate their hairy individualism. The group's sole purpose is `` to allow members to fraternize about the politics of having hair on your face,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the caucus chairman The other members are Reps. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Flake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION> The numbers are shrinking, down from about a dozen last year. There are no beards in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. One of the caucus' clean-shaven defectors, Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is scornful of the `` wimps'' who shave before an election, or wait until they've won to grow a beard. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> got rid of his 17-year-old goatee only after the election, he says proudly. `` I just got tired of reading in the newspapers that I won by a whisker or had a close shave in the last election,'' he said. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> has no intention of growing a new beard _ `` I feel almost like a virgin, as though I've captured my long-lost youth,'' he says _ but smooth-chinned Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, says he will grow another. Shaving, says <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON>, `` is my way of splurging, my little way of rewarding myself after an election.'' Moreover, `` I've discovered that the humidity of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is the greatest inducement to shaving known to mankind,'' he said. <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> says shaving off a beard before an election campaign is hazardous. `` Many members now have to resort to an expensive media campaign that features them with one look,'' he said. `` As I discovered, when folks get used to seeing you one way, and then see you a few weeks later looking another way, it draws instant criticism.'' Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., now clean-shaven, says he grows a beard `` every time I take a couple of days off'' and always gets complaints from constituents `` I've gotten more nasty mail over my beard than over any other issue since I've been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he says. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> plans to grow his back. <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, who is chief deputy whip for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, says he shaved his beard briefly last Christmas because his family had n't seen him for 10 years without one `` They did n't like what they saw, so I grew it back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Clashes Kill 3, Injure Scores; Army Says Figures Inflated</HEAD>

 Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Palestinians and wounded 74 others in widespread clashes Thursday in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army reported only eight woundings and accused Palestinians of inflating the figure to gain sympathy. The gunshot wounds reported by Palestinian hospitals brought to more than 225 the number reported injured in clashes with soldiers this week. The army has confirmed only 22. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, more than 100 teen-agers from Jewish settlements hiked near the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beita </LOCATION>, where an Israeli girl was killed a year ago, to symbolize their demand that the occupied lands be part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It's our country. We must walk here,'' said 16-year-old <PERSON> Biti </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaovitz </PERSON> from the settlement of <PERSON> Karnei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomrom </PERSON>. Soldiers and armed settler leaders guarded the hikers. Under an agreement with the army, they did not enter <PERSON> Beita </PERSON>, where 15-year-old <PERSON> Terza </PERSON> <PERSON> Porat </PERSON> was accidentally killed by a Jewish bodyguard a year ago when a group of hikers got involved in a confrontation with stone-throwing Arabs. Before Thursday's hike, soldiers raided the village to search for <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. Two youths were wounded by army gunfire, a military spokesman said. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said five were wounded. The army's deputy spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, said, `` The reason you see a greater number of wounded is because of a deliberate attempt by Palestinians to overload the list.'' `` There is no dramatic increase in the number of wounded,'' he said. The wounded figures from hospitals include people who are treated for gunshot wounds, then released. The army says it does not include these since it can not verify if they were shot by soldiers or fellow Palestinians. `` This makes it easy for the Palestinians to inflate the figures,'' said <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>. He added the army also can not confirm gunshot victims who go to private hospitals or clinics, only those treated in government hospitals. Of the 74 reported treated in five <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals on Thursday, the army confirmed 11 Palestinians wounded, eight from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and three from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. An official at the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for Palestinians refugees, said he had reports of 30 gunshot wounds by midafternoon in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and was still receiving reports. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Of the 154 reported wounded earlier in the week, the army confirmed 14. The army reported that soldiers Thursday ran into a violent protest in the Askar refugee camp near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and opened fire, killing one Palestinian. The victim, <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbieh </PERSON>, 20, was shot in the chest, hospital officials said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharableh </PERSON>, 30, died of a gunshot wound to the chest in a clash with soldiers after Moslem prayers at a mosque in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, 15-year-old <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ead </PERSON> was shot in the chest in a protest in the town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> and died en route to the hospital, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The army was checking the reports of the deaths in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Thursday's deaths raised to 454 the number of Arabs reported killed in the revolt, which began in December 1988. Eighteen Israelis have died. On Thursday, the PLO-backed leadership of the uprising issued a leaflet rejecting plans by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to hold elections in the occupied lands.

An aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not offer an alternative to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election proposal, despite the rejection of the plan. On Wednesday, 83 prominent residents in the occupied lands rejected the idea, calling the elections a ploy to end the uprising without giving the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> what they want: an independent state. `` This is the best program we can suggest to them,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections of local Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, to be followed by talks on the final status of the occupied lands. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has repeatedly rejected the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>' demands for their own state and talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio: `` We have heard an announcement from some of our neighbors that they reject our proposals. I hope this is not their last word.'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> if Palestinians turn down the peace proposal, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must adopt a policy `` of a more intense action of putting down first of all the violence.'' This, he said, `` will bring about, between half a year to a year, acceptance of the political way by elements in the Arab world and, first and foremost, in the territories.''

<TEXT>
 Passover, the Jewish holiday of exodus, was a festival of return this year for a group of Jews who lived in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> more than four decades ago. `` It was symbolic of the return of a Jewish presence to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' said <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said of the Passover seder celebrated this year in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest city <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON>, as honorary chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, last week led 25 <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> or their descendants back to the city that offered thousands of Jews refuge from persecution in the first half of this century. The tour, which included 50 others from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and other countries, also provided new impetus to growing contacts between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which have no diplomatic relations. For most on the trip, nostalgia took precedence over politics. <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON>, chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gurion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negev </ORGANIZATION>, recited the Kaddish, or prayer for the dead, at the synagogue, now a law college auditorium, where he prayed with his parents as a boy. <PERSON> Sasson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>, foreign editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, returned to the house where he spent his childhood. He also found his old synagogue, now a <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> government education bureau office. `` Nothing has changed. They have n't even repainted the interior,'' he said. The Red Guard, the young leftists who destroyed houses of worship throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, apparently failed to discover the Hebrew inscriptions now hidden behind a movie screen. The group also found several former Jewish cultural centers. At one, they ran into a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> wedding in what is now a public hall. `` Most of it remains as we remember it,'' <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said, adding that while the homes in the old foreign quarters are run down, today's <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> is vibrant with activity. Gone are the downtrodden masses of beggars, rickshaw drivers and the desperately poor. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Jewish community dates back at least to the 19th century when <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>'s ancestors arrived from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The Iraqi Jewish community, numbering about 1,000, included families such as the <LOCATION> Sassoons </LOCATION> and Kadoories who were to become rich in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trade. The <PERSON> Sassoon </PERSON> family in 1921 helped build their synagogue, and <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>'s father was once the temple's rabbi. The next wave, including <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON>'s family, were refugees from the Bolshevik Revolution. Many of the 8,000 Russian Jews first stopped in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION> and other northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> cities. The third and largest group was German and other central European Jews escaping Nazi persecution before and during World War II. From 20,000 to 25,000 eventually made their way to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> occupies a very special place,'' <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said. `` It is the only country in the entire world that did n't know what anti-Semitism is. The Chinese people by their nature are very tolerant, and Jewish people have benefited from that.'' <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said that in his speech at the Passover seder, he spoke of parallels between two of the world's oldest cultures. Both value scholarship and the family, he said, and both are very pragmatic in their approaches to life. Jewish traders are believed to have settled in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even before the beginning of the Christian era, but the first permanent Jewish community was probably established in the 11th century in <LOCATION> Kaifeng </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Kaifeng </LOCATION> Jews, who may have arrived by way of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, flourished until the 19th century when they assimilated with the Chinese and their customs and rituals gradually disappeared. During their <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> visit, the tour met with the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judaic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of Chinese scholars formed several months ago to study the heritage of Judaism in <LOCATION> Kaifeng </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities. `` They want to be in touch with Jewish organizations in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said. He said the forming of such a group, and the warm reception they received in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, were indications of increased contacts between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, long a firm supporter of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> causes. `` As <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> said, a 1,000-mile journey begins with a single step.'' The Jewish community in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> dissolved in 1948 and 1949 with the communist takeover and the creation of the Jewish state in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But now, <PERSON> Tekoah </PERSON> said, the links have been restored. `` For each one of us this was a very moving return to our roots.''

 Moslem guerrillas bombarded <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> with rocket fire Thursday, the 11th anniversary of the communist coup, and officials said at least six people were killed and four were injured. The military fired back with long-range missiles into the surrounding mountains where the insurgents are hiding. The guerrillas issued a statment from their <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, headquarters describing the 1978 revolution as `` the beginning of more than a decade-long nightmare.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iran-based guerrillas and Afghan refugees marched in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest the communist coup. Hundreds of Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> also marched and burned an effigy of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose government backs the Afghan leadership. `` Long live <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>! Down with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>! Down with communism!'' they shouted while marching near <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech to diplomats and visiting delegations, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said the army has proved it can defend <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> without the help of Soviet troops, who completed their withdrawal from the country Feb. 15. `` The enemies had set a deadline of two or three weeks after the withdrawal for occupying <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said. `` You can see that ... the armed forces have created an unsurmountable barrier before the aggressors.'' As he spoke to 1,500 people at the presidential palace, rockets and explosions could be heard outside. Fifteen rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> starting at sunrise. One landed in the central square, where a day earlier the government celebrated the anniversary with a military parade. The parade was held a day before the actual anniversary because of fears of attacks. There had been speculation for weeks the guerrillas would send a volley of rockets into the city of 2.25 million people Thursday. The dead included two soldiers and a member of the local security forces. One rocket killed two women, injured two children and a man, and destroyed three mud-and-stone houses, military officials said. About half a mile away, another woman died and a child had his legs blown off when a rocket slammed into their house, the officials said on condition of anonymity. This year's observance of the Saur, or April revolution, was subdued. Most businesses closed and there were few people or vehicles in the streets, which were lined with the black, red and green Afghan flag, and the red flag of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> The Moslem insurgency began after the coup that ousted President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> on April 27, 1978. More than 1 million people have died in the fighting and 5 million Afghans _ about one-third of the country's population _ fled to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one communist government with another and stayed to help fight the insurgents, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> became president in May 1986. On May 15, 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> under a U.N.-sponsored accord.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers and a civil liberties group are joining 10 news organizations in seeking release of a sealed document described to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial jury by his principal lawyer. The news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, are battling the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to gain access to the stipulation, which has been given to the jury. The document summarizes intelligence intercepts concerning a CIA-assisted arms shipment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the early stages of the Iran-Conta affair. The news organizations are seeking a speedy hearing on their request, saying that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers were free to disclose `` the entire stipulation on the public record'' during final arguments in his criminal trial. North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> described what the document shows in open court on April 19, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says full disclosure `` would threaten national security.'' The stipulation describes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government tracking of the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Saturday rejected the motion of the news organizations to gain access to the stipulation, saying it `` is a classified document.'' The organizations went to the appeals court Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> now wants the matter sent back to district court to give the government an opportunity to spell out in secret to the judge why the press should be denied access. Alternatively, the department wants 14 days to file a brief in the appeals court. On Thursday, the news organizations opposed both government requests, saying the case should remain in the appeals court and that briefs should be filed by next Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> supports the news media's request for an expedited hearing on the request for public disclosure `` The government has made no attempt here to show any compelling interest for sealing an exhibit which has been shown to the jury and partially read in open court,'' stated the motion by <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. North's lawyers say nondisclosure of an exhibit at a criminal trial is incompatible with the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a public trial and with the Classified Information Procedures Act. <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> makes no provision for partial release of a trial exhibit to jurors but not to the public, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers. Court security officers deleted portions of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s courtroom comments on the intercepts from the official court transcript, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ruled that they must be restored. One deleted passage said that employing certain intelligence-gathering methods allowed <PERSON> North </PERSON> to know `` exactly what was going on in the Iranian initiative and exactly what was happening with respect to the transfer of missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Another deleted passage said the intercepts were delivered to high-ranking government officials, including <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and Deputy National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Rising Crude Oil Costs Behind Increase in Prices for Imported Goods</HEAD>

 The prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter, largely reflecting a surge in the cost of crude oil from abroad, the government reported Thursday. The first-quarter price increase, down slightly from a 2 percent pace in the final three months of 1988, would represent a 7 percent annual inflation rate if sustained for a full year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. On the export side, meanwhile, prices for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods sold overseas rose 1.4 percent in the last quarter after declining 0.3 percent in the preceding three months. The increase, which reflected higher prices for exports of food, fuels and crude materials, would translate into a 5.7 percent annual inflation rate. The quarterly figures are not adjusted to remove seasonal factors. Economist <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the price increases for both exports and imports were `` consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as a whole are getting close to full capacity'' in industrial production, a condition that can create shortages and bottlenecks that drive up prices. The January through March increase in import prices was primarily due to an 18.3 percent jump in prices for imported fuels. The fuels increase was led by a 27.8 percent surge in prices for imported crude oil that followed a November production accord by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. Despite the first-quarter increase in fuel costs, average prices for imported fuels still were one-third below their 1985 levels. Excluding fuels, import prices rose a modest 0.5 percent during the first quarter after climbing 2.4 percent in the previous quarter. The advance in prices for non-energy imports was held down in part by the appreciation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar during the period, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The dollar's value increased 3.2 percent last quarter after falling 4.9 percent in the preceding quarter, according to a trade-weighted index used by the department. The index now is 2.1 percent higher than it was in March 1988. On the export side, prices for food sold abroad rose 2.5 percent last quarter after declining 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1988. The grain index, which reflects prices for roughly one-half of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food exports, rose 5.9 percent in the first quarter after falling 6 percent in the final three months of 1988. Since March 1988, the grain index has risen 35.3 percent, mainly due to last summer's drought. Prices for crude material exports rose 4.9 percent last quarter; prices for fuel exports advanced 2.9 percent. For a year, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and keep inflation in check. But <PERSON> Gault </PERSON> said it will take some time `` for the tightening of monetary policy in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and in other industrialized countries to slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact on the inflation rate.'' For the 12-month period that ended in March, import prices rose 5.1 percent while export prices advanced 6.3 percent.

 It may not be hog heaven, but a new home in the bucolic mountain town of <LOCATION> Ojai </LOCATION> is a big improvement for Grunt the pig, who was facing the prospect of becoming bacon only a week ago. The estimated 1,000-pound animal, whose plight touched people across the country, is to be sent to a ranch where it is hoped he'll live high on the hog. `` This place that was arranged through the Fund for Animals sounds like a perfect location, with other animals there like donkeys, geese, all kinds of other animals,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` It sounds like a real good life to me.'' But the wife of <PERSON> Grunt </PERSON>'s new owner sounded a bit, well, disgruntled. `` Seems to be any animal in the country who's not wanted by somebody, guess who gets it,'' said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>'s contractor husband, <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON>, was selected from more than 300 people across the nation who offered to give <PERSON> Grunt </PERSON> a new place to wallow. The porcine plight began when <PERSON> Grunt </PERSON> was abandoned by his owners, who moved from their home in affluent <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>. They gave their gardener permission to butcher him, but the 4-foot-tall hog was rescued by animal control officials when his terrified squeals alerted neighbors. Meanwhile, officials say Grunt seems to be reveling in all the attention. `` He seems to be happy about it,'' said Animal Control Officer <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` In fact, he seems to be a big ham about it.''

 Plane painters got to cut loose with a million-dollar corporate jet, decorating it with a menacing shark's jaw on the nose, gang-like logos in bright colors on its fuselage, in a job that was anything but plain But the paint job _ including one graffito tag saying, `` Elvis on board'' _ was temporary. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, director of marketing for the Englewood-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said painting was a chance to display the company's nonconformity. `` It was our chance to be irreverent,'' he said. `` We treat these planes with such kid gloves all the time, polishing, cleaning and maintaining them like gems. We were having fun.'' The six-passenger jet had reached 20 years of age and 12,000 air hours, a point in which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requires a complete dismantling and overhaul of an aircraft's engine, electronic and navigational systems Part of that overhaul includes a new paint job, officials said.

 Star Wars scientists conducted a 20-second laboratory flight test of a prototype weapon designed to maneuver in space to destroy enemy boosters early in flight, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials announced Thursday. The test of a Space Based Interceptor prototype, last Monday in a laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was billed as a breakthrough by the Pentagon. It followed a test flight of the vehicle last Nov. 18 lasting two seconds. `` The last test proved that the baby could stand up. This one proves that it can walk,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said that the technology could be used on the `` Brilliant Pebbles'' interceptor that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday would be a main focus of Star Wars research. `` That was the first time that a space weapon has flown. We integrated the propulsion and guidance units into a configuration and flew it for the first time,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, a scientist involved in the test. Pentagon officials showed reporters color film of the device, powered by small rocket engines, rising 30 feet in the air, using small rocket engines to maneuver within a protective net, then settling back down. Engineers could be heard cheering wildly inside the laboratory. The reusable device cost $ 3 million to build, is six feet long and weighs 154 pounds when loaded with 20 pounds of propellant, said <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>. The test itself cost $ 500,000, he said. It did not move forward and did not include sensing devices to track enemy boosters. `` The technology advances here are in extreme light weight and fast response,'' said <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>. The rockets aboard the device fired in 450-millisecond bursts with 350 pounds of thrust, according to the Pentagon. A millisecond is one thousandth part of a second. The Brilliant Pebbles plan discussed by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> this week envisions thousands of orbiting satellites, each about three feet long and weighing less than 100 pounds, equipped with sensors to spot, track and target satellites. Each `` pebble'' would also have rockets to drive it toward an enemy booster at speeds capable of destroying it without using explosive warheads. The technology exists to reduce the weight of the vehicle tested Monday to 10 pounds, said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoessell </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> SDIO </ORGANIZATION> official at the briefing. The test also was intended to show the ability of computers aboard the device, programmed in advance, to give orders to maneuvering rockets that pointed the vehicle with a precision one-eighth of a degree, an accuracy that would be necessary to steer the weapon toward an enemy rocket. `` This is something that had never been done before,'' said <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>. Scientists plan another test of the prototype this June, when it will be equipped with a infrared tracker pointed at a rocket engine parked and firing in a parking lot outside the laboratory, said <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>. The prototype space vehicle would not leave the inside of the laboratory, and therefore would not break the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which restricts tests of space-based anti-missile systems. Cuts in the Star Wars budget have delayed for several years any space tests of the technology demonstrated on Monday, said <PERSON> Stoessell </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration this week proposed cutting Star Wars spending to $ 4.6 billion in fiscal 1990, down from the $ 5.9 billion proposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his last budget recommendation.

 West German leaders on Thursday criticized <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s rejection of superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons and urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to show more readiness to deal with the Soviet bloc. `` There is much to fear in this world. But we certainly do n't have to fear negotiations, or a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is ready to talk,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, winning cheers and applause from opposition as well as government party lawmakers His remarks followed a major policy speech in Parliament by Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also stepped up pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to negotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear rockets and artillery. `` Because of the range of the short-range systems, the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is affected more by these weapons than the other partners in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also has called on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to delay a decision on modernizing aging short-range <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> nuclear missiles until after federal elections next year. Polls indicate most West Germans oppose <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to increase the range of the Lance missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations are in disarray over <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal for superpower negotiations on short-range weapons. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has given <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> a clear rebuff, fearing negotiations could lead to elimination of the short-range weapons and increase the threat to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from superior <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also rejects <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposal. But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> have indicated their support for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. Another <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partner, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on Thursday announced it was siding with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The Western alliance hopes to reach a common position on the issue before the May 29-30 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, but there have been no signs the stalemate can be broken before then. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> delivered a ringing address indirectly targeting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` Those who want disarmament must take up negotiations,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should keep a cautious eye on reform movements in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other Soviet bloc nations, because there is no certainty their results _ including promises of unilateral disarmament measures _ will be permanent. But <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> urged the West to be far more receptive of positive Soviet bloc developments. `` This is a historic opportunity. We can not let it pass us by and wait passively. That is our responsibility,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s call for an increased Western dialogue with the Soviet bloc. `` We should support the reform processes in all <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, urging `` our European and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends to help carry out this policy and agree on a common course.'' Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range weapons are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> reassured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other alliance partners that his government does not want to eliminate those arms. `` In the current circumstances, land, sea and airborne short-range nuclear weapons are still important in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Group Urges Tighter Regulation of Lawn Care Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group on Thursday urged tighter government regulation of the multimillion-dollar lawn care industry, saying there are few state laws to ensure workers are properly trained or warned of potential health effects of the chemicals used. Public Citizen, a private environmental and consumer organization, said a national survey shows that nearly two-thirds of the states have no requirement for either training or testing lawn care employees. The survey said only about a third of the states require that consumers be given information about the chemicals used and in most of those states a company supplies little more than a chemical label. Only a handful of states require notice before a lawn is treated or a warning that it has been treated, according to the survey. As a result, `` millions of Americans may be unwittingly exposed to potentially dangerous pesticides in their own back yards,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who wrote <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>'s report on the survey. The lawn care industry has grown rapidly in recent years with more than 7 million households using such sevices annually. In 1987 the industry had revenues of $ 1.5 billion, according to Public Citizen. Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> also wrote a recent report maintaining that many of the chemicals used by the lawn care industry have the potential of causing long-term health problems including cancer, birth defects, liver, kidney or nerve damage as well as short-term ailments. The industry has defended its use of the chemicals, saying the companies only use them in accordance with safety instructions supplied by the manufacturers and that the chemicals are approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for lawn care use. `` We have to be registered and certified in most states,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> says in her report that while the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> approves the use of chemicals for lawn care, there is little federal regulation of lawn care companies and no federal training or performance standards for workers who actually treat the lawns. Here are some of the findings, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> survey: Only six states require both that advance notice be given of scheduled lawn treatment and that signs be posted afterward. Those states are <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> require the warning signs, but no advance notice, while <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> require the advance notice but no post-treatment warning signs. A dozen states require lawn care company employees to pass a state test. Those states are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. But only in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> are lawn care employees required to be both trained and tested under state-supervised programs. In most states consumers also are left without detailed explanations of the potential hazards associated with lawn care chemicals, said Ms. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. Only <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> require state information sheets to be provided to customers. Seventeen other states have some form of consumer information requirement, but in many cases that amounts to merely providing the names of the pesticides being used, the report said.

<HEAD>Conservationists Say Wildlife Loss from Oil Spill Much Worse than
Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY B. DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Press reports from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> have failed to get across the vast killing of wildlife or the enormous remaining risks to millions of birds, animals and fish from the oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, a conservation group said Thursday. `` We may already be seeing only one percent of the dead,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manville </PERSON>, senior staff wildlife biologist for Defenders of Wildlife. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION>, who spent April 12-17 observing cleanup efforts and damage from the March 24 spill, said reports of 200 to 300 miles of beach contaminated by the 11-million gallon spill were `` wildly inaccurate.'' Actual beach contamination, he said, `` is probably closer to 1,000 to 2,000 miles'' of coastline and islands southwest of the sound. Aerial spotting may report many beaches clean when an on-the-ground inspection would show they are not, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said. He said he was unable to say how much uncontaminated coastline remains at risk. `` The war on stopping the oil spill is lost, in my opinion, but a few skirmishes can still be won,'' he said. `` The unfortunate fact of the matter is that ongoing wildlife rehabilitation is probably more for the public's benefit than for the wildlife's.'' His organization was joined by several other environmental groups in writing the tanker owner, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and other cleanup authorities asking greater attention to wildlife. The letter from Defenders, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and Trustees for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> called for immediate installation of protective booms and stationing of skimming equipment at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nellie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> in western Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Stockdale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> on the northwest coast of <LOCATION> Montague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and development of a plan developed to protect Orca Inlet if necessary. Millions of waterfowl migrate through the sound area every year, and 300,000 to 500,000 birds make the sound their home for at least part of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said. Birds on their northward migration probably would not land on oil or oil-soaked areas in good weather, but if the weather is bad they might `` and we could have the catastrophic loss of millions of birds,'' <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said. Oil has been spotted 325 miles from the spot where the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said. This was a somewhat greater distance than the 275 miles mentioned in the latest confirmed reports from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Accurate counts of dead wildlife have been difficult, <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> said, because of scavenging by eagles and gulls _ which may die after eating oil-soaked carcasses. Deaths include up to 300 <LOCATION> Sitka </LOCATION> black-tailed deer; at least one bear, and muskrat and porcupine. Probably three-quarters of the 5,500 sea otters living in the western half of the sound, the half hit by the spreading oil, have been killed or harmed by the oil, he said. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated on April 14 that nearly all the otters in the oil `` impact area'' had been killed. As of Wednesday, 391 dead otters had been counted either in the wild or after unsuccessful rescue attempts. Defenders recommended the transfer of additional `` super-sucker'' oil scooping ships from the oil-exploration areas off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope; a visit to the sound by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>; trials of a new detergent, BioVersal, offered by a West German company for beach cleaning; payments by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> of $ 1 billion a year for five years for restoration; conversion of key areas of the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> slope to a wilderness area to prevent drilling there and refunding the money for some $ 95 million worth of drilling leases not yet awarded in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, another major fishing ground.

 Gunmen shot and killed a leftist congressman as he took his children to school Thursday and authorities said he was the highest elected official killed in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s nine-year insurgency. No group claimed responsibility for the attack. In the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, guerrillas raided a river town and occupied it for four hours, killing a woman and wounding five people, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Eriberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>, a congressional deputy from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, was killed in <LOCATION> Chaclacayo </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> surburb, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said but refused to give further details. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of communist parties, has the second-largest representation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Radio Programas, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station, quoted police as blaming the lefist <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, which has admitted to 15,000 killings in its nine-year war against the government. But the Path, which seeks to impose communist rule, has made only infrequent attacks against legal leftist groups. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edmundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrugarra </PERSON> told reporters the anti-guerrilla death squad, the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, killed <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murrugarra </PERSON> said a gunman, seated with three others in a car, opened fire on <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> and his wife as they were leaving their three children at a school. None of <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>'s family members was injured, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programas </ORGANIZATION> said. The Franco Command surfaced a year ago vowing to kill people it considers leftist guerrillas or their supporters. The government led by center-left <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> party has denied any connection to the rightist group. In the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, at least 150 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> aboard motor boats on Tuesday stormed <PERSON> Contamana </PERSON>, on the <LOCATION> Ucayali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 390 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, according to the respected daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused to confirm reports of the attack. Ten defenders in the town's police post traded shots with the attackers for an hour before running out of ammunition and fleeing into the surrounding dense jungles, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Comercio </PERSON> said. The Movement is an anti-U.S. guerrilla group, which emerged one year before <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 1985 presidential elections. Actions by the organization so far have been confined to attacks that generate publicity but little bloodshed.

 Acting experience did n't ease the butterflies Meryl Streep felt when she went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to complain about chemical additives in food and drink. `` I'm uncomfortable in a public platform,'' she said. `` But the issue of pesticides in children's lives ... was alarming enough that I felt that I wanted my friends to know about it and I felt that other people would be interested in it.''

 Pravda on Thursday published seven pages of astonishing admissions by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials that their failures had led to embarrassing losses in parliamentary elections and damaged the people's faith in their leaders. The officials, speaking at a meeting of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the 20 million-member party is in danger of losing its unity and hold on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people `` The people feel uncomfortable, alarmed, have lost their optimism,'' said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON>, who lost in the March 26 elections. `` Various generations of people, separate social layers and even regions are quarrelling among themselves.'' His remarks and those of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and 19 other speakers dominated Pravda, the party's official newspaper. <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON> said people were losing faith in the party, and that as a result, party organizations `` have lost their vanguard role.'' This was a striking admission that the party had failed in one of its primary goals, to lead Soviet society. Remarks at Central Committees generally are kept secret, and publication of 20 critical speeches delivered Tuesday appeared to be an effort to show the people the leadership is hearing their complaints. Admissions that perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 4-year-old restructuring program, has failed to solve many of the country's problems also could serve as ammunition by people fighting for more radical reform <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gained strength to push for more extreme action at Tuesday's meeting, when 74 of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s 301 members retired. Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who retired had lost the top government or party job which entitled them to membership. The remarks of some of those who retired were published Thursday. Among them was <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, the 65-year-old former party chief in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and a close associate of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. News reports have accused <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> of corruption and falsifying records to show he was a war veteran. But <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the accusations were untrue and came from people he had fired in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> for wrongdoing. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovyev </PERSON>, the highest ranking of the approximately three dozen party officials who lost in the elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, said that despite perestroika, `` The minuses here still significantly exceed the pluses.'' Because of the failures, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polozkov </PERSON>, a party leader in the <LOCATION> Krasnodar </LOCATION> region of southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, `` the authority of the party is falling in the eyes of the public.'' Many members feel no need to adhere to the party program and rules, and some are so despondent over the lack of recognition of their accomplishments that they have turned in their party membership cards, he said. Several other speakers painted similarly bleak pictures. `` Today, people do not have confidence in tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, the party chief of the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> region. `` We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is `` in a real crisis'' that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is not fully aware of because the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff is `` safeguarding the general secretary from the severity of the situation.'' <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> told the committee many party officials are so afraid of the people's wrath that they are refusing to run in the next round of elections to the 2,250-seat parliament on May 14. In closing remarks at the committee meeting Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of housing, consumer goods and food, but said people still have faith in the party. `` I do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a debating society and so on,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The party's dialogue with working people is not a weakness or making the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a debating society. If it is weakness to conduct a dialogue with all segments of society, then I do not know what courage is.''

 The juvenile justice system was created to deal with `` the children of folks like us'' and should be toughened to punish `` the kinds of kids who did what happened in Central Park,'' a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> congressman declared Thursday. `` What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime, you're going to do big-boy time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> spoke at a news conference called by four congressional freshmen, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Crime, to say the beating and rape of a woman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park on April 19 highlights a need for changing the juvenile justice system `` I can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is modeled basically for the middle class,'' <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said. `` The children of folks like us, the children of the middle class who may get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age; they may throw a rock through a window, that's where the juvenile justice system works. ... But the system does not work, and it's no deterrent, and it's no protection and should n't be for the kinds of kids who did what happened in Central Park.'' Asked to explain his `` folks like us'' comment, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said, `` The kinds of people who are in this room ... people who are not involved in the drug scene, people who are not making their living selling crack. That's what I meant by the kinds of folks who are in this room.'' Eight people, ages 14 to 17, are in custody. Only one has a police record, and in general teachers called them good students. One principal said of two of them: `` They come from homes of parents who care, parents who are as shocked as we are.'' Four lived in a building with a doorman. The congressmen said that in many states youngsters who commit violent crimes such as rape, armed robbery, murder or attempted murder get little more than a slap on the wrist. The task force is hoping by the end of the year to create standardized state legislation `` that would cause the most violent of juvenile offenders to receive the full punishment for their actions if they're convicted,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, a former district attorney. The task force would strongly urge states to pass its model legislation, he said. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said he hoped <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would pass his own bill to withhold federal money for juvenile justice from states that fail to adopt such model legislation. The other two members of the group at the news conference were Reps. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.

 A mentally disabled, AIDS-infected 7-year-old who won a long legal battle for admission to public school attended class for the first time Thursday amid cheers from supporters and hugs from classmates. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, wearing a pink dress and matching bows in her hair, received a warm welcome at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exceptional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where supporters cheered outside the single-story, red-brick building. Administrators pushed for a smooth transition inside, and fellow students wasted no time getting acquainted with their new classmate. `` She rushed in, the children came around her and one of them hugged her,'' said <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who fought officials' fears that her incontinent daughter posed a health risk to others through bodily secretions. `` They just surrounded her,'' she added. `` They did n't need any introduction.'' A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the child could attend school without being confined to a glass isolation booth, paving the way for what Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called the most important day of <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s life. Principal <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she sent notes to parents Wednesday to prepare them for the girl's arrival and received seven calls of concern, with one mother saying she was not ready to accept the risk. A meeting aimed at reducing anxiety among parents is scheduled for next week, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sickles </PERSON>, deputy superintendent of <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools. <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> carried a knapsack and a toy that plays the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> song `` It's A Small World'' as she entered school to become the 12th student in her class. `` It's a wonderful day for her,'' attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` She'll do wonderfully here. She's going to take off like a rocket.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said she was glad the 2 -LCB- - year legal battle was finally behind her `` I'm too happy to be bitter about anything,'' she said. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellano </PERSON>, a family friend and head of an AIDS support group called <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frenz </PERSON>, was among seven supporters outside the school where 201 pupils are enrolled. `` I know she'll benefit from playing with other kids,'' she said. `` She's always around adults and always having to look up. Now she'll have eye contact with children.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>, who originally ordered the glass booth for <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, ruled Wednesday that the girl posed no significant health risk to her classmates. Her initial decision would have confined the child to the booth until she became toilet trained and learned to stop sucking her fingers. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said she would not put her child in a `` glass cage.'' The latest decision came four months after the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> sent the case back to Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>, who had been taught at home since June 1987, must be placed in a regular classroom unless there was evidence she posed a threat to other children through bodily secretions. School officials generally said they were relieved that the lengthy battle is finished. One, however, indicated he was still concerned about safety and said if he had a child in <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s class he probably would not let the child stay at the school. `` Based on the knowledge I do have right now, I could not allow my child to be in the class,'' school board Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rampello </PERSON> said. `` ... A judge's decision does n't take away the trepidation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> adopted <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> as an infant in her native <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The girl became infected with AIDS from tranfusions of tainted blood shortly after her premature birth.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Thursday he will no longer inform <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about airline security threats because he fears public disclosure could hamper security measures. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also told reporters that passengers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines may be barred from taking electronic devices on jets. The bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 in December was hidden inside a radio-casette player. Later, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will install a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bomb-detection device _ thermal neutron analysis _ at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> this summer. The device can find plastic explosives that standard X-rays miss. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will be the first foreign country to use the $ 1 million device. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said it should be installed throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> following the Dec. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> explosion. The jumbo jet, bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was blown apart by a tiny bomb over the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, on the last stop of a five-nation European tour, said he was adamant about not discussing publicly intelligence-gathering or unannounced airline security bulletins. `` I have just sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advising them that I will no longer disseminate information to them regarding security bulletins until I am absolutely sure that they have a mechanism in place to protect that information,'' he said. He said he plans new regulations about leaking airline `` security-type information,'' adding, `` I may seek legislation making it a crime.'' Last month, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> criticized a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a security bulletin that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sent to airports and carriers March 16 about a possible hijacking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> thinks disclosure of warnings would prejudice security and that public notification of the many threats would result in them being taken for granted. After the Pan Am explosion, <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was accused of bungling the dissemination to airlines of West German warnings that Palestinian terrorists had devised a new radio-cassette bomb. The first of the thermal neutron analysis devices will be installed at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in July. After the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accelerated by six months a $ 60 million thermal neutron analysis program. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he expected the devices to be installed at several European airports by year's end. `` Every place I have gone, everyone wants to do more,'' said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who arrived Thursday night after meeting government officials in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. On electronic devices such as portable computers, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that unless a sure means of scanning them is devised, they might be barred from aircraft. But he added that a ban was unlikely.

 Iranian authorities arrested 792 drug pushers and addicts in a two-day nationwide narcotics sweep, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said two notorious drug smugglers were among those arrested in southeast <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION> province, along with 165 pounds of opium and a large quantity of cash. Since a new anti-narcotics law went into effect on Jan. 21, more than 2,000 people allegedly involved in drug abuse have been arrested. The law carries the death sentence for possession of even small quantities of drugs. According to official reports, 416 people have been convicted of drug offenses and executed. Most arrests made since January were in provinces along the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, from where authorities say most of the drugs are smuggled into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Officials have estimated that 1 million of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people are drug addicts but unofficial estimates put the number at twice that.

 While the jury continued deciding his fate Thursday, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> turned his attention to a speech to an invitation-only audience in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. North, the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide being tried on 12 criminal charges stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, has made several speeches since the trial began on Jan. 31 at fees believed to be $ 20,000 - $ 25,000 each Asked how much <PERSON> North </PERSON> was getting for Thursday night's speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, club manager <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasure </PERSON> said `` that's confidential.'' The legal bills of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, who has had at least three lawyers at the defense table and at times as many as five, are estimated at $ 380,000 a month. Reporters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> were told there would be no press coverage of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s speech in DuBois Tower. The Bankers club's 1,200 members principally are bankers, lawyers and businessmen and women The three men and nine women on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s jury, meanwhile, deliberated for the sixth day without any hint of where they stand. They sent no notes out of the room and made no requests of the judge. They quit for the day shortly after 4 p.m., having worked on their verdict for 5 -LCB- hours _ a total 32 -LCB- in the six days. All 363 exhibits, totaling some 1,300 pages are in the second floor courtroom where the jurors are meeting so there is no need for them to ask for specific documents. Meanwhile, 10 news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, are appealing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s ruling that they can not see a North trial stipulation summarizing intelligence intercepts concerning a CIA-assisted arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. North's lawyers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> are lining up on the side of the press, which is trying have the document _ available to the jury _ released to the public as well. North attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> read aloud part of the document during his final summation in open court last week. Court security officers deleted some of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s words from the official transcript, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> ordered them restored after the motion by the news media. But he also declared the stipulation itself to be classified and that is the basis of the appeal. The stipulation referred to intelligence `` intercepts'' that tracked _ minute-by-minute _ the CIA-assisted shipments of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hawk missiles sent from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985. North's lawyers used it in an effort to show the shipment was known at the top levels of the government <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told the jury to `` remember, <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is charged with somehow doing a chronology and leaving out the November 1985 missile transaction and somehow fooling <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, even though they got all this material which shows exactly what it was.'' The reference was to the late CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Later in the censored-then-uncensored transcript, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> called the intelligence intercepts `` the most guarded, most closely held intelligence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. ... They remain classified, top secret, code level even today.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s office said all of the jurors were bearing up well, apparently having overcome earlier health problems. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cover up his role in secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales. He also faces charges alleging he personally profited from the affair. Also Thursday, the chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said he had renewed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s permit to carry a concealed weapon in the county, where North lives. `` It's very unusual'' said Chief Judge <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, adding that of 77 applications filed in 1988, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the sole recipient of a permit. North feels threatened by terrorists and what his attorney calls `` the nut element,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. One of the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that he accepted an illegal gratuity _ a $ 13,800 home security system, which he says he needed because of terrorists' threats.

 On one side of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, wildlife agents set up scarecrows and fireworks Thursday to scare migratory birds from landing on oily beaches. A different kind of fireworks was being planned on the other side of the sound, where residents of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> prepared for a town meeting Thursday night with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and others involved in cleaning the nation's worst oil spill. `` The mood here is people are really concerned,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, a resident who has started a weekly newsletter on the oil spill and its effect on the small fishing community of about 2,500 people about 50 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said some of the concerns likely to be expressed at the meeting were: _ Cannery workers want to know why they're being asked to release Exxon of liability for canceling the herring season in order to get claims checks _ Businesses want to know why they are n't being reimbursed for their loss of business _ Fishermen are concerned that the Exxon Valdez still is leaking and want it moved from one side of Naked Island to the other so crude wo n't flow directly toward hatcheries `` Last time we talked with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> everyone was very frustrated,'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> said. `` The frustration level is still pretty high, but it's kind of matured We do n't expect things to change very fast. They're so disorganized.'' Heavy fog canceled spotter flights Thursday and kept skimmers in port. Wildlife agents arrived Wednesday on <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and were setting up propane cannons, scarecrows and other devices to scare migratory birds away. The plywood scarecrows also will eventually be erected on <LOCATION> Seal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, another favorite stopover for seabirds headed north, officials said. `` We went to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> and bought 36 sets of clothes'' to outfit the scarecrows, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillivary </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; Wildlife biologist in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The life-sized scarecrows with painted faces were made with only half-length arms so that shirt sleeves flap in the wind. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> said Wednesday the hazing program, financed by the company, is a contingency plan. `` We could have that oil up before the majority of the birds arrive,'' he said. Exxon officials said cleanup of the islands would begin within days. The Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said some migratory birds have arrived, but most of the tens of thousands that pass through the area wo n't do so until early May. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said he doubts the usefulness of the program, but does n't fault the <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for preparing it. `` It's something that we support reluctantly,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, the society's vice president for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The scare tactics are unlikely to have an impact because they will be conducted in a very small part of the vast sound, and because the birds heading off to breeding grounds are `` genetically and physically programmed'' to go certain places, <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said. `` It's extremely difficult to deter them.'' A Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at the agency's regional office in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> defended the hazing program. `` Basically, the methods they will be using have been used extensively in the Lower 48,'' spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieben </PERSON> said. More than 10 million gallons of oil spilled when a tanker ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24. Exxon and the state dispute the amount of the spill, with the oil company setting the figure at 10.1 million gallons and the state at 10.9 million.

<TEXT>
 To no one's surprise, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved quickly to fulfill his campaign promise of strong efforts against the illegal drug trade. But to almost everyone's surprise, he also suspended imports of assault rifles and talked of possible federal controls. Drugs and guns have highlighted the domestic policies of the first 100 days of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, including an emergency plan to combat drug-related murders in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> which became the nation's murder capital in 1988. A leftover problem and a sudden crisis put the spotlight on other domestic areas in the 100 days that ends Saturday, as the Republican leader moved carefully in many other policy matters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a major proposal to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to deal with the savings and loan crisis left from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is grinding away on the bailout bill, estimated to cost $ 157 billion over 10 years. And then the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground, pouring oil from the giant tanker into the sea and polluting the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> shoreline. The administration came in for criticism for not moving fast enough to try to halt the environmental damage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eventually dispatched <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to deal with the cleanup. But the president made clear from Inauguration Day that dealing with the drug problem was at the top of his agenda. `` This scourge will stop,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, adding that it was `` the most obvious'' area `` in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance.'' The president named <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> the nation's drug czar, charged with the task of coordinating the fight. But almost immediately <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fight against drugs raised another tough issue, gun control. Semiautomatic assault-style rifles were becoming increasingly popular with warring drug dealers around the country, but public demands for controls on the weapons did n't take off until January, when innocent children became the victims of a man who opened fire with such a rifle on a school yard in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Five children were killed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a lifelong member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, vowed for the first six weeks in office that he opposed any ban on the rapid-fire assault-style rifles. He maintained that stance even though his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> just two weeks after her husband's inauguration that she fears guns and thinks assault weapons should be banned Faced with a growing public outcry against the weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relented a bit. Less than a month later, the president asked <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to look into the situation and revealed at a news conference that he had told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, `` if you come to me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end.'' The initial suspension on imports of semiautomatic weapons, announced March 14, came only a few days after <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was sworn in as director of the office of national drug control policy, and the announcement came out of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had directed that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s office handle the announcement to place some distance between the suspension and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. When the administration expanded the suspension a month later to include 24 models of weapons that had been left out of the original ban, the announcement came out of the White House. The president is a lifelong member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which was clearly not thrilled by the wayward path of its most well-known member. But the powerful lobby kept its powder dry when the first suspension of imports took effect, saying the action would cool off the public outcries over the weapons triggered by the schoolyard shootings Jan. 17 by <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, a 24-year-old drifter, in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> denied allegations by an administration source that it had delivered messages through third parties to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> threatening his political future because of his stand on the weapons. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a Republican National Committeeman and machine gun dealer who also owns a $ 23 million office furniture company in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no other option but to suspend the imports. `` I think it's the only thing he could have done ... What he did was defused, temporarily, a situation that is being totally overreacted to,'' <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. As for the drug-related violence in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> outlined an emergency plan April 10 to combat the problem. In doing so, he blasted Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s handling of the issue, which brought a comment from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> that `` We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to pick fights.'' The administration had hoped to have a comprehensive drug, crime and gun package ready to announce during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s four-day trip this week, but it did not materialize. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the package is a week to 10 days away. The president's budget proposal for fiscal 1990, starting Oct. 1, reflected his interest in the drug war by requesting $ 5.5 billion to fight the battle, almost a $ 1 billion increase over spending this year and about $ 236 million more than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had sought for 1990.

 Police are arresting non-Indian protesters at a record pace at lakes where the <ORGANIZATION> Chippewa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> are spearing fish under the guarantee of 19th-century treaties, state officials said Thursday. An organizer of a sit-in protest at which 35 people were arrested Wednesday night said more opponents of the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>'s court-affirmed treaty rights are willing to go to jail, and similar protests may be staged The arrests were made when crowds gathered at boat landings on northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> lakes where the annual Chippewa spearing season began last weekend prior to the fishing season for non-Indians. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, a spokesman for Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin and one of those arrested, criticized <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crofoot </PERSON> for roping off boat landings where the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> were spearing, thus restricting protesters from the lakes. `` If Sheriff <PERSON> Crofoot </PERSON> does n't come around we might try it -LRB- a protest -RRB- with 300'' people, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. `` What we would like is equal access to the landings. We're not trying to test the jails.'' This is the fifth spring that <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s six <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> bands have speared fish since a federal court ruled in 1983 that the tribe retained the right to gather food off-reservation. The right was guaranteed under 19th-century treaties that ceded much of northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Spearfishing critics say the three-pronged spears used by the Indians leave too few trophy-size walleyed pike for non-Indian anglers when the rod-and-reel season begins in early May. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulson </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> who helps organize the tribe's spearfishing activities, said police were `` doing a fantastic job'' protecting the Indian spearers. But tensions between the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> and non-Indians were at an all-time high, he added. `` I do n't think it can get any worse than this,'' he said. `` All we can do is hope.'' Twenty-six of those arrested were charged Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Oneida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with violating a county disorderly conduct ordinance and released on signature bonds, District Attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Nine others were released from jail after posting bond and will be charged at a later date, he said. In all, 43 protesters were arrested at three lakes Wednesday night, raising the total number of arrests to 46 since the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> began their spearfishing season Sunday night. In <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>, chief warden for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday it was `` clearly the case'' that police would arrest a record number of protesters this season. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said Wednesday's protests marked the first organized civil disobedience involving treaty rights opponents. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DNR </ORGANIZATION> chief of enforcement, said crowds of protesters at boat landings this year have been `` more emotional and larger than at this time in other years.'' The Wisconsin Natural Resource Board on Thursday approved an emergency rule that authorizes the state to sharply reduce bag limits for non-Indian anglers who fish lakes that are also speared by the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>. Under the rule, the state will reduce the number of walleye taken daily by anglers from five to three or less on the 254 lakes that the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> plan to spear this spring.

<HEAD>Probe Reveals Former Officials Profited from HUD Contracts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An investigation into a federal housing renovation program has revealed a pattern in which former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials raked in handsome profits on contracts to rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor. The inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> drew a comparison with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, with former government officials drawing big fees as consultants to developers seeking government contracts. But Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he had found no evidence that active <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had been involved in influence-peddling and made no charges of criminal activity. The investigation by the department's inspector general, announced Wednesday, also listed several former top-level <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who later won contracts as developers of rehabilitation projects. The consultants _ who charged fees up to $ 1.3 million _ included President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first interior secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>; the late <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, attorney general under President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>; former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, also a Republican. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, in an interview Thursday, said that while he had found no illegality or criminal activity in the investigation into <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, contracts had been distributed in ways that suggested favoritism and insider information was used to direct <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> awards for projects Money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states, who by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> formula were fairly entitled only 16 percent. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he had turned over the 700-page investigative report to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s public integrity branch for review. The rehab program is a $ 225 million a year endeavor that has survived in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> despite efforts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to kill it. Through it, developers win contracts to acquire and renovate existing housing and receive <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guarantees of subsidized rents for 15 years. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in a memo to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> that developers and local public housing agencies `` were led to believe the consultants enjoyed a special relationship with persons making recommendations and decisions.'' Interviews with housing officials suggested favoritism in the program was widely suspected. `` This is not news to me; it was suspected,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanaugh </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authorities </ORGANIZATION>. One <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said, `` This was the road to the gravy train _ you come in here and work a few years and then get out and make millions in mod-rehab.'' Addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing scandal, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said in his memo: `` In Defense, the contractors were paying consultants to obtain information to influence contract awards. At <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the developers were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate rehabilitation units to public housing authorities. `` The difference between the two situations is that the investigation at <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> was able to prove that the consultants paid government employees for information and for selecting a particular contractor. Our investigation at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was unable to substantiate that government employees received any financial consideration from the consultants.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report questioned the role of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, the former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner, who was responsible for the program's beginning in 1986. The investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984. Investigators found that a nonprofit charity, FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> headed before joining <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, received $ 290,000 from recipients of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracts under the program. Efforts to locate <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> were unsuccessful Thursday. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, expressing shock at the `` fundamental flaws'' and mismanagement revealed by the investigation, ordered a halt to 35 pending awards worth $ 100 million, his aide, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, said Thursday. Eight contracts already executed in the current fiscal year will be allowed to continue but will be audited, as will nearly 300 existing contracts. Investigators found nearly $ 59 million in excess subsidies paid by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and said if the pattern existed throughout the program, the figure would reach $ 413 million. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the report showed the program `` was misused to feather the financial nest of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration favorites.'' He praised <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s actions, announced intentions to hold hearings on the investigation and said he would ask the Office of Government Ethics to examine the reports on former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' report named 11 former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who participated in project contracts as developers and owners, consultants, or representatives of lenders. Among them was former Under Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and former Assistant Secretary for Housing <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>. Both were presidential appointees under then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, and later became owner-developers in half a dozen rehabilitation projects. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> is now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; efforts to reach him through the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> did not return a reporter's call to his <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> office. Others included <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former special assistant to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who the report said collected $ 1.3 million in consultant fees on such projects. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s one-time executive assistant, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, was identified as an owner-developer in six projects. <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> collected a $ 300,000 fee as a consultant on a 312-unit project in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, Md. Investigators reported that he `` said that his role was to talk to the ` right people' and convice them that the project was needed,'' the report said. It said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> was paid $ 375,000 as attorney and consultant on a 1984 <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> project in which he in turn paid <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> $ 75,000 for his assistance. `` <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told him he had <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contacts from the top on down, because he and -LRB- <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> -RRB- ... were friends,'' the report said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told investigators that he knew <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> but that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had never discussed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matters with him. <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> was paid $ 183,000 as consultant, most of that in a <LOCATION> Lynn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, deal. Also named as a consultant who received $ 260,000 in fees was <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, no relation to the president, who has been nominated as ambassador to <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. Calls to <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> were not immediately returned.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will reduce its armed forces by 11,500 men and assign them to jobs in the economy. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> described the move as a gesture of good will. It comes in addition to cuts of 10,000 men, 600 tanks and 50 planes announced in January. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> made the announcement during talks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, governor of the West German state of <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, at a news conference, later confirmed the ADN report. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said 11,500 men will spend three months receiving basic military training and will then be sent to different jobs in the economy for the remainder of their obligatory 15-month service. The agency did not specify when the cuts will be implemented and did not say in which economic sectors the future recruits would be employed. According to Western estimates, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has about 175,000 men under arms. When he announced the troop and equipment cuts in January, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> also said the country would reduce its military budget by 10 percent. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the reductions will begin on Friday and will be completed by 1990.

<HEAD>House Democrats Ask Reconsideration of Naval Strategic Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Democrats concerned about a naval strategic modernization plan's compatability with a U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty sent a letter Thursday to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urging him to review the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they want a force of at least 20 Trident submarines equipped with a high number of missile tubes _ 24 _ rather than more submarines with fewer tubes. In the letter, the lawmakers asked for a better plan `` in order to maintain a robust naval strategic fleet _ and strengthen our current arms control negotiating posture.'' `` Under the scenarios proposed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would retain over 4,000 strategic warheads,'' the lawmakers said. `` However, the proposals _ or the Trident's missile tube configuration _ may need to be revised.'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed to limit each country to 4,900 ballistic missile warheads. Under a U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reduction treaty, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plan would leave fewer than 900 warheads for land-based missiles, the lawmakers said. `` If we continue to procure one Trident per year, as currently configured, we may end up buying Tridents in excess of those we would deploy under START,'' the letter also says. `` This may force premature retirements of one or more Tridents _ forfeiting a multibillion-dollar expenditure.'' Among the possible options, the letter suggests, is redesign of the Trident to carry fewer missile tubes, research on a smaller strategic submarine or slowing down production of the Trident. `` I am concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> may be going down a blind alley with its strategic modernization plan,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa., one of the signees of the letter `` It appears incompatible with the current arms control framework.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee, raised the issue with the deputy chief of naval operations for plans, policy and operations at a congressional hearing Vice Adm. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said the Trident gives the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> the necessary flexibility and survivability, and another witness _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for nuclear forces and arms control policy _ cautioned against strategy based on a U.S.-Soviet treaty. `` The last thing we want to do now is act as if we have an agreement in START,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said. In addition to <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who signed the letter were <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON>, D-Minn

<HEAD>Some High School Seniors Sabotage State Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Kelle in 13th graf is correct.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seniors at a high-achieving high school sabotaged their answers on a test that measures the school's academic quality, and one said the diminished scores were a rebellion against pressure to perform Administrators at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> denied there was too much pressure, and a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> suggested that dragging down the school's score on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assessment Test may have been sparked by something else. `` I think it would be interesting to know what else is going on at that campus. The last time this happened at a school a few years ago, students were mad at the administration for putting speed bumps in the parking lot,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>. She said officials at the education department's testing office have talked to the school, and said there was no chance of getting a second test. The results are used to determine a school's academic placement compared to other schools in the state. The results are published in newspapers and are considered by the state for achievement awards and grants. Home buyers use the results when a good school district is a consideration. Reading scores at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> dropped from the 85th percentile statewide last year to the 51st percentile this year and math scores fell from the 95th percentile in 1987-88 to 71st percentile this year. `` We thought that it was the wrong high school,'' said Principal <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bawden </PERSON>. `` And then we got some rumors that maybe some of the seniors had sabotaged the test.'' He said a check of students' test booklets, which are not signed, showed an unusual number of wrong answers in 18 booklets, including some booklets that contained no right answers. <PERSON> Bawden </PERSON> said one student admitted deliberately doing badly on the test. He denied extraordinary pressure was placed on students to do well. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Franchini </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Torrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday he had talked to teachers at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb, and said he was unaware of any extra problems or pressure that would have caused the sabotage. But <PERSON> Franchini </PERSON> said the CAP test is a ripe target for angry students, since names are not on the tests and the results are averaged for the entire school. `` A lot of these seniors have been tested, perhaps over tested,'' said <PERSON> Franchini </PERSON>. `` They have the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Test of Basic Skills, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and various achievement tests. They are tested, tested, tested. So when this one comes along and it does n't have their name on it, they may think ` Well, so what?''' Student body President <PERSON> Kelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said Tuesday some seniors became disgruntled when teachers interrupted classes to prepare students for the test and when administrators visited classes stressing the importance of doing well. `` They said this is the test that is the school's report card,'' said Ms. Price, `` and West is a really good school and that we all want to keep it up. I think a lot of people resented that.'' She said she did not participate in the sabotage. <PERSON> Franchini </PERSON> disagreed with Ms. <PERSON> Price </PERSON>'s allegation that extraordinary pressure was brought on students. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said the last time a test was sabotaged was in 1984-85, when CAP scores were tied to state cash bonuses to the schools. That program has been canceled. She said the students at one school said they would do poorly on the test to protest speed bumps placed in their parking lot. `` The damage is done,'' she said of the results at West. `` It's not hurting them, its hurting their younger brothers and sisters They have broken the school's trend.''

<HEAD>Changes in Physicians' Reimbursement Will Be Recommended</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An independent government agency that monitors the Medicare program will submit a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday urging change in the way the program pays physicians to make the system more fair and to help cut soaring costs. The <ORGANIZATION> Physician </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Payment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recommends a uniform fee structure that would be based on the actual costs of providing services. Fees would be set at national rates for the 7,000 medical services covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and the rates would be adjusted to reflect geographical cost differences. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays physicians based on what they and other doctors in their area customarily charge, a system that critics say is neither fair nor efficient. The current system pays less for `` evaluation and management services'' _ typically provided by family practice and internal medicine physicians _ than for surgical and other invasive procedures relative to the time and effort required of the doctor. Under the payment system the commission proposes, fees would be raised for family practitioners and lowered for many specialty physicians, including surgeons and ophthalmologists. The proposed system would be based on a plan developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. That plan sets fees for services based on the costs of a doctor's education, training and equipment as well as the mental and physical effort and technical skill and judgment required of the physician. The commission also proposes to limit the amount physicians can charge <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients for a service beyond the amount approved by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> has been one of the fastest growing sections of the federal budget, with last year's expenditures rising more than 15 percent over the preceding year. Much of the increase in Medicare outlays for physicians' services has come from an increase in the volume of services provided, according to the commission's report From 1980 to 1988, the number of services provided per <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees has increased by 7 percent per year, the report said. The report says many of these services have little or no benefit to patients. The commission calls for more research on the effectiveness of medical services and the development of guidelines to reduce the use of procedures that have minimal benefit, and thus cut <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs. The commission's plan also proposes to set expenditure targets based on estimates of inflation and growth in beneficiaries and services. These would work as incentives for physicians, the commission said. If expenditures come in at the target one year, the next year's physicians' fees would be increased at the rate of inflation. If expenditures exceeded the target, physicians' fees would be increased by the rate of inflation minus the amount exceeding the target. Conversely, if expenditures were under the target, fees would be increased by inflation plus the amount under target. `` It's a mechanism for gaining control over the growth in spending and to provide the financial incentives for physicians to take more seriously the need to control the volume of services,'' said <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON>, commission deputy director.

 A crowd of more than 5,000, mostly schoolchildren, chanted and sang political songs as they marched six miles behind a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> convoy carrying released <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas toward the border Thursday. The crowd began gathering at dawn at Ongwediva Lutheran mission station, where 31 guerillas spent the night after greeting streams of Namibian peasants who came to see them and participate in a church service. Most black schools in the area around the garrison town of <LOCATION> Oshakati </LOCATION> were closed Thursday as the students marched. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> police monitors watched the procession, which grew larger as it progressed. South-West African police were barely visible, and army patrols were non-existent. The South African-controlled military was restricted to base from Wednesday to Saturday to allow the estimated 600 guerrillas in the territory a safe route to the border. The <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas endangered a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> when they crossed the border from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> on April 1. Under the plan, they were to wait in their Angolan bases until mid-May when they were to return, unarmed, as refugees to take part in November elections. South African-controlled military forces, which had been confined to base in accordance with the plan, were released to fight the SWAPO incursion. According to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> Administrator-General <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, the battles caused the deaths of 305 infiltrators and 27 security force members. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday at <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the territorial capital, that 3,941 military personnel from 21 countries are deployed in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to help monitor the transition to independence. The South African military on Wednesday turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> 31 guerrillas captured in the fighting. At midday Thursday, 28 of them walked across the border at <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> and got into trucks to carry them to their bases 100 miles to the north, a territorial official said. Three injured fighters were taken elsewhere to recuperate. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is supervising a transition period and elections aimed at ending <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 74-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The independence plan is tied to a southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace agreement that provides for withdrawal of South African and Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. American, Soviet, Angolan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and South African delegations met Thursday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to discuss developments. `` This is perhaps the most serious meeting the joint commission has faced so far,'' South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in welcoming the delegates. `` Since we last met ... in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> we tried our best, all of us, to deal with the serious problem that has arisen as a result of <ORGANIZATION> SWPAO </ORGANIZATION>'s incursion and violations.'' The meeting represents the first time in decades that Soviets, Angolans and Cubans have made an official visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, since relations were broken over the country's laws of apartheid _ racial separation. Bishop <PERSON> Cleopas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumeni </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> who conducted church services at the Ongwediva mission Wednesday evening and Thursday morning, suffered the loss of a son killed by security forces and a daughter killed by a bomb explosion blamed on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> during the 23-year <PERSON> bush </PERSON> war. He told the <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> fighters, `` They -LRB- the villagers -RRB- have come to see you and admire you. The coming of the group here shows that they appreciate your great sacrifice.'' Some of the guerrillas greeted family members they had not seen for five to 13 years.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control adviser, accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday of seeking military advantage even as it appeals to public opinion seeking arms reductions. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> the Soviets `` play to the grandstand of public opinion while masking their own very real efforts to achieve military advantage.'' The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator, who advises President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on arms control issues, said the Soviets were trying to promote a positive image in the West and divide the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance at the same time. In the speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> challenged Soviet sincerity on withdrawing tanks from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on the issue of short-range nuclear missiles. While Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in January that none of the 10,000 tanks to be withdrawn would remain in the Soviet military inventory, <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> quoted Gen. <PERSON> B.V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snetkov </PERSON>, the Soviet commander in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as saying last week that some of the tanks would remain in the Soviet arsenal. On short-range missiles, <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> accused the Soviets of propaganda. He said while Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has objected to improving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons the Soviets have been modernizing their own missiles for a decade. <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said the Soviets are replacing the SS-23 missiles banned by the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with SCUDs that have a range of 300 miles and have been replacing FROG missiles with SS-21s with potentially greater range and accuracy. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has an advantage of at least 16 to 1 over the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in missiles below the range of 315 miles, <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said. Within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is resisting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to extend the range of <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missiles and has called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the Soviets to scale back such weapons. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, with support from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, has rejected the West German overture. `` On this issue,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said, `` the Soviets have created a credibility gap so wide one could drive a tank through it.'' He said the Soviets have tried to make arms control the main focus of their relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they believe that serves Soviet interests. `` Preoccupation with arms control diverts attention from the critical underlying causes of East-West tension which the Soviets cleary recognize __ the differences in the values of our respective social systems,'' <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Study Says Conservation Could Cut Billions From Utility Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An aggressive conservation effort by electric power companies could sharply reduce consumers' utility bills and save the companies millions of dollars in pollution-control costs, according to a study released Thursday. The Center for Clean Air Policy, a Washington-based think tank, said its 18-month study showed that cutting electricity use would help both consumers and the utilities, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions by substantial amounts. Fossil fuels burned in power plants and by other energy producers are blamed for the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide, which is considered to be a major contributor to global warming. The study focused on potential savings to two of the nation's largest electric utility systems _ the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> A 7 percent cut in electricity sales by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> by the year 2000 would reduce by 26 percent, or $ 51 million, the amount it would have to pay for pollution controls over that period. A 10 percent drop in sales by <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> over the same period would reduce its pollution control costs by 55 percent, or $ 77 million, the study said. These energy conservation programs would save <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>'s customers $ 1.23 billion over the next 30 years, the study said. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s customers would save $ 891 million over the same period. The savings are based in part on the assumption that lower demand would preclude the need for the utilities to invest in new generation capacity. `` It's time we started addressing our basic environmental problems through approaches like energy conservation which eliminate pollution rather than just moving it from the air into the ground or water,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, the study group's chairman.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it will allow a potentially promising new AIDS drug to be tested on people infected with the deadly virus. Researchers say the drug, known as GLQ223, is unique because it appears to kill only those immune system cells that are infected with the AIDS virus, leaving non-infected cells alone. However, they caution that the drug so far has been tested only in the laboratory and has not been used on AIDS patients. `` I'm very optimistic because of the test tube results, but there's always the possibility it could have unpredictable side effects or when given to humans the drug may not be able to get to all the infected cells,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> led a team of scientists from <ORGANIZATION> UCSF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that developed GLQ223. The drug is a highly purified form of the plant protein trichosanthin, which is derived from the root of a Chinese cucumber plant. The plant extract has been used in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to induce abortions. In the laboratory, the drug has been found to work on two different types of cells crucial to the normal functioning of the immune system _ T-cells and macrophage cells, which act as a reservoir for the virus. AZT, the only drug now licensed for treatment of AIDS, and other drugs like it only prevent the virus from replicating in T-cells. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Corkery </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, called the drug `` very promising,'' and said he is `` cautiously optimistic'' about its prospects. <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the clinical trials are expected to begin in May at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, primarily to determine safety and human tolerance of the drug. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said the trials are expected to last three to six months. If a safe dosage can be determined, then trials would be conducted on the effectiveness of the drug. <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> also cautioned that though GLQ223's active ingredient is found in some Chinese herbal medicines, `` such preparations may also contain other components with unknown toxic effects.'' Also, the company said that since the toxicity of trichosanthin itself has not been evaluated in AIDS patients, it `` cautions against the use of trichosanthin or trichosanthin-containing preparations as an AIDS therapy.'' The drug is being developed with money from the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which would have rights to market it.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has approved a request for the first field testing of two genetically altered potato varieties which could be resistant to three destructive plant viruses. A permit to conduct the test was approved for <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the field testing of both disease-resistant varieties will begin later this month near <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and that one of the varieties also will be tested in <LOCATION> Nampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` The experimental design of these trials is sound and should provide important scientific data without causing any significant impact on the environment,'' he said. Three disease-causing organisms _ leaf roll virus, virus x and virus y _ infect potato crops, causing yellowing and stunting of plants, <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said. Depending on conditions, the viruses can cause a 5 percent to 10 percent yield loss, or more, as well as a drop in product quality. The Monsanto potato varieties were developed by taking genetic material from the viruses and inserting it into the potato. In greenhouse studies, the company found that the material produced proteins in the potatoes, which protected them from disease. In a related development, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the first outdoor test of cotton genetically engineered to kill caterpillar pests began on Thursday. The cotton project was announced two weeks ago. The new cotton variety is being tested on a one-acre site at <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Starkville </LOCATION>, Miss. A gene from a common bacterium, Bacillus thuringienensis, was inserted into the cotton plant. The gene produces a protein that is toxic to caterpillar-type insects but not to humans. The cotton was engineered by scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Agracetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Middleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. If successful, the new variety could protect itself against such pests as the bollworm, tobacco budworm and armyworm.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Police Spirited Rushdie Away From Dinner Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, in hiding under death threats from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, was spirited away from a dinner by police worried about Moslem students nearby, a newspaper said Thursday. The Daily Mail said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was attending a private dinner party with professors at an <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> college. It said detectives spotted Moslem students near the college and `` fearing an attempt on his life, the officers interrupted the author during the party with dons -LRB- instructors -RRB- and spirited him out of a side entrance.'' The paper said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was driven away in an armored car, and officers worried whether a security lapse had led to details of the party leaking out. The Mail did not say when the reported incident occurred, and police declined comment. The office of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s agent, <PERSON> Gillon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON>, who acts as his spokesman, did not return a phone call. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> went into hiding 10 weeks ago after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ruled that his novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam and ordered Moslems to find him and kill him. Many Moslems contend the book is blasphemous because it includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives, and it suggests <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>. On Wednesday night, five Moslem women protesting a new play defending the right of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and other writers to freedom of expression invaded the stage at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> and halted the performance for 10 minutes. The one-act play, `` Iranian Nights,'' was nearly over when the women staged their peaceful protest, a theater spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Attendants escorted the women off the stage and out of the theater, and the play resumed without further interruption. No arrests were made. The play is by dramatist <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a well-known left-wing student activist in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the 1960s. It covers issues raised by the events surrounding <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and `` The Satanic Verses.'' The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, meanwhile, quoted <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s agent <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON> Thursday as saying he believed <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was eager for his book to be published in paperback toward the end of the year, despite warnings from Moslem leaders in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that it would inflame the controversy. <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON> was quoted as saying there had been little discussion with <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> about paperback publication, but `` I think he is keen that this book should be published in the way that his other books have been published.'' <PERSON> Viking </PERSON> <PERSON> Penguin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s hardcover and paperback publisher, said there were no plans at this stage for a paperback edition. The Times said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> telephones <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON> at his office about twice a week to discuss the book's sales. On March 17, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s right to freedom of speech and to publish his book Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government subsequently ordered the expulsion of 18 Iranians from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, saying they were perceived as a security threat. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliated by ordering 18 Britons either to be expelled from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or not allowed back into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 18 companies said Thursday they planned to jointly publish a Spanish edition of `` The Satanic Verses.''

<HEAD>Anti-Baldness Drug Works on Growth Genes, Upjohn Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The anti-balding drug minoxidil promotes hair growth apparently by affecting gene activity, a finding with implications for the treatment of genetic disorders, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> researchers said Thursday. Minoxidil has been marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> under the trade name Rogaine since its approval by federal regulators in September, but the way the drug makes hair grow has been poorly understood. Researchers had previously suggested the drug stimulated the flow of blood to the scalp and hair roots, thereby promoting growth. `` Our experiments do not negate the blood-flow hypothesis, but they do demonstrate that the drug directly enhances growth and maturation of cells that form hair shafts,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Buhl </PERSON>, an Upjohn researcher. Knowledge of growth gained from study of minoxidil's effects on cell growth could have implications for research into genetically based diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, <PERSON> Buhl </PERSON> said, although some scientists voiced skepticism about that contention. Minoxidil was originally developed for internal use as a treatment for high blood pressure. As an anti-balding drug, it is applied externally to the scalp. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> researcher, said minoxidil was applied to whiskers removed from mice and placed in cultures in a petri dish. Other whiskers were left untreated as a control on the experiment. After three days, hair treated with minoxidil had grown, while the untreated hair had not. Further work showed that the minoxidil `` not only affects growing cells, but affects cells that make hair-shaft protein,'' <PERSON> Groppi </PERSON> said. `` Minoxidil affects gene activity that affects the growth of the -LRB- hair -RRB- shaft.'' Another scientist, however, was skeptical that the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> finding represented a significant advance. `` Within our cells, we have between 50,000 and 100,000 genes, and many of those genes, probably at least several thousand, are poised to respond to the effects of different kinds of stimulants,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It would be rare for a physiological stimulant, including this drug, not to affect the expression of one or another gene.'' Although the drug may affect hair follicles, there is no reason to believe that the drug would have similar affects on other types of cells, <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said the research would have been more compelling had it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the drug. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, that the researchers had n't identified a specific gene. <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> also cautioned against concluding that effects on hair in a culture would also be seen on hair growing in tissue, such as on the scalp. `` In a culture, it is meaningless because cells in culture behave differently than when they are sitting in tissue,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said that although the research was performed on hair in cultures, `` we do feel that what we're looking at here is an accurate indication of the effectiveness of minoxidil.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> research was abstracted in the May issue of the Journal for Investigative Dermatology and was to be presented in full Saturday at the annual meeting of the Society for Investigative Dermatology.

 An Arab League delegation failed Thursday to persuade Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to reopen the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> office here. `` There is no change in our policy,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said after the 45-minute meeting. <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s representative here, said he had `` the impression'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was not opposed to reopening the office. `` But he wants to have the proper timing and the proper circumstances,'' <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> told reporters. The office was closed in March 1988 after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> declared the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization. Since then, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held a series of meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and is seeking its support for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said the Arab delegation told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the office should be reopened in light of the talks begun by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in December. However, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke to a reporter on condition of anonymity, said no change was contemplated. The delegation also disagreed with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to have Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> elect leaders to negotiate an interim self-rule arrangement.

But <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said it was an attempt by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` to frustrate the international outrage concerning the practices of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the occupied territories.'' He called the proposal `` a charade'' designed to undermine the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has declared the only legitimate representative of Palestinians.

 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s president is willing to allow Ethiopian Jews to emigrate and rejoin families from whom they have been separated since a secret airlift to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was halted, a congressman said Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, said he received the assurances of President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> at a meeting in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> during <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Easter recess <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> also defended <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s role in efforts to deliver emergency food supplies to thousands of starving people in rebel-held southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. While acknowledging that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> was n't working with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> relief efforts, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> claimed they were taking other steps to help get food across the border before the rainy season arrives in May and makes roads impassable. `` Recognition of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s cooperation in the urgent humanitarian mission to save the people of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> is imperative to future efforts towards establishing peace throughout the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said some news reports have unfairly painted Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> as a `` villain'' in the emergency relief effort to supply food to Sudanese people caught in the country's civil war Although <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is not working with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> `` Operation Lifeline,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said 5,000 to 7,000 metric tons of food is en route to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> under a joint relief program of private, voluntary and church organizations headquartered in the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Roughly 120 trucks are needed for the joint-relief effort separate from the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION>'s mission, and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is providing at least half of those vehicles. `` They are allowing for cross-border operations to happen, just not under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who also visited <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to assess the situation. `` When it comes to feeding the hungry, we should not take potshots because -LRB- <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> -RRB- does n't agree with us ideologically. On the issue of Ethiopian Jews, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said in an interview that <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> assured him recently in that he is committed to `` family reunification'' and that the issue is `` a project we can work on mutually.'' `` There are families who are being reunited,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` The Ethiopian government has been forthcoming about allowing families to be reunified and I expect more of that will be realized as time goes on.'' Like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> restricts the emigration of its people. More than 10,000 Ethiopian Jews remain in what <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said is the poorest country in the world, peasants who were left behind after an exodus in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Between November 1984 and the first days of 1985, an estimated 7,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, joining about 6,000 who had made their way to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> earlier, before <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> imposed emigration restrictions. The secret operation in late 1984 was stopped when the Belgian charter company flying the refugees to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> balked at the publicity in the international press. The Ethiopian Jews trace their roots in Judaism back 2,600 years. American Jews have supported efforts to bring the Ethiopian Jews to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said he did not ask <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> for any numbers on how many Ethiopian Jews had been reunited with their families in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the world.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> accepted a consent order Thursday to settle allegations it discouraged blacks from joining the 40 <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spa </ORGANIZATION> health clubs it operates in five <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. In a settlement approved by a federal judge, the <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, Md.-based company did not admit or deny any of the allegations. It accepted the consent order, negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys who filed the lawsuit on Feb. 10, enjoining any discrimination by Holiday Spas. In the settlement, the company agreed to show black people in advertising and to include a statement that it does not discriminate against minorities. The consent order, approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, also directs the company to give blacks who may have been turned away another opportunity to join the club. The company operates 40 health clubs in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, said in a statement the case `` was resolved quickly because there was absolutely no reason, no excuse and no defense in how these defendants were conducting business decades after these anti-discrimination laws went into effect.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> noted that the consent order contains an `` elaborate procedure to ensure that all personnel of the company from top executives through individual club employees, receive comprehensive training in the subject of racial fairness.'' In a press release, read by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mezines </PERSON>, the company said it `` did not admit any of the allegations in the original complaint, agree to any fines or the legal contentions'' made by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The statement quoted <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandel </PERSON>, Holiday's vice president, as saying: `` We at Holiday have never discriminated against any prospective member or a member and our clubs are open to all who comport themselves in accepted manners.'' The consent order said it was `` not to be considered in any way an admission or finding of any discrimination'' by the company. But it contained a statement of evidence the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have produced at trial, including a summary of testimony from black applicants who would have said they were not told of the least expensive membership packages or the most favorable loan rates. Former employees were prepared to testify that they were instructed to tell black applicants that no one was available to give them tours of the health clubs, the statement said. Black members would have testified that they received rude treatment from club employees. `` Former employees would testify that black members were treated in this manner to discourage them from utilizing the club facilities and to discourage them from recommending the club to other black persons,'' the statement said. Former employees were also prepared to testify they were reprimanded by club managers for selling memberships to blacks and that they often did not receive commissions for these sales.

<HEAD>Unions Ask Congressman To Ax Random Testing From Railroad-Drug Use
Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Random drug testing is `` nothing more than looking for a needle in a haystack'' and is n't necessary to prevent drug - and alcohol-related train accidents, railroad unions told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday The unions told Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, he could accomplish his goal of safer railways without making workers go through unnecessary tests. `` There comes a point where enough is enough,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 17 unions. `` Rail workers now are subjected to numerous potential alcohol and drug tests each year,'' he said in testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. New employees are screened for drugs before they're hired, he said. Once on the job, workers are tested after accidents, during physicals, when they return to work after illnesses and when there's some suspicion of impairment. A bill proposed by <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> would require drug testing of all railroad workers with `` safety sensitive'' jobs, set standards for the labs that do the testing and require that railroads maintain rehabilitation programs. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled March 21 that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s current drug-testing regulations are constitutional. The random drug-testing allowed under the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision would be limited under <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>'s bill. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief counsel, told the subcommittee the bill would `` set in concrete'' some testing options that `` could far exceed actual safety needs.'' The administration favors no changes to the policies supported by the high court, he said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said he feared mandatory random drug and alcohol testing would give railroads an excuse to cancel costly rehabilitation programs. <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> compared rail workers to long-haul independent truckers. `` There are thousands of ` gypsy' truck drivers operating their trucks over our nation's highways utilizing medicinal aids to stay awake and continue driving their trucks for unrealistic periods of time,'' he told the subcommittee, which <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> heads. `` Why not propose requirements for random testing of both truck and automobile drivers?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION> said it supported the idea of random drug testing but did n't like <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>'s plan because it singles out railroads from other forms of transportation. Association President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> also said he disagreed with a proposal to force railroads to guarantee that workers who have completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation are reinstated in their jobs. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> interpreted the complaints from both labor and ownership as a positive sign. `` Frankly, that tells me that we are on to something here,'' he said. His bill duplicates a measure that passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the last session.

<TEXT>
 Police in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> stepped up the hunt Thursday for extortionists who spiked baby food with glass, razor blades and caustic soda, and the number of reported cases of tampering rose to more than 200. Three babies were hospitalized in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> but were released after doctors found they were not harmed by contaminated food, hospital authorities said. The only victims so far are a 9-month-old girl who cut her mouth on a piece of razor blade in a jar of yogurt and two mothers cut by glass hidden in baby food. Police said the total number of reported cases stood at about 220. Not all the reported cases have been confirmed. Police say the majority of cases are probably the work of `` copy-cats, people getting on the bandwagon, cranks and some cases of self-contamination,'' an unidentified police detective said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the British domestic news agency. He said they believe there may be some cases of people putting items in food in a bid to claim compensation from companies, but the vast majority will be by cranks and copycats. `` We are not pointing the finger at mothers. People are genuinely finding contaminants in food,'' the detective was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said no one has been arrested in connection with the contamination but that some people were arrested locally for hoaxes. A Yard spokesman had no details of the hoaxes. H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and Cow and <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which together control nearly 80 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s baby food market, on Wednesday offered a joint reward totaling $ 169,000 for information leading to the conviction of the extortionists U.S.-owned <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said it had received an extortion demand it refused to disclose. It issued a statement Thursday saying it had not paid any money and never would. Cow and Gate, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Nutricia </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said it had not received a demand. Police said only two of the reported cases were definitely linked to the <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> threat. Police and government officials refused to comment on newspaper reports that the extortionists were paid $ 850,000 this year and were now demanding an additional $ 1.7 million. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard, which is coordinating the hunt for the saboteurs, refused to comment on the investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, a respected conservative daily, said detectives from 12 countries were searching for the extortionists. Local police forces reported 91 cases of suspected baby food contamination, including five in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and 21 more unconfirmed cases. Across the border in the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, police said two cases were under investigation. Home Office Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON> said Wednesday that 28 incidents of tampering with jars and cans of baby food had been reported since April 7, including 11 on Wednesday. Mothers reported finding glass shards, pins, needles, broken razor blades, stones and caustic baby soda in jars and cans of baby food and in one case, in powdered milk. Most were in Heinz or Cow and Gate products, but several were in other brands of baby food. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and Cow and Gate have not pulled their baby food products off supermarket shelves. In stores where contaminated jars and cans have been found, all stock has been replaced. Both companies have said their internal investigations have determined that their products were not tampered with during production. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard detectives believe the extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of resealing jars. The small glass jars have metal lids with an indented center that indicates the vacuum seal has not been broken. In its statement Thursday, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said, `` Police have stressed that there has not at any time been a need for a general or batch recall of baby food products.'' The company stressed that a general withdrawal of the products `` would not solve external tampering. The problem would reappear at any future date on Heinz products or any other food products sold in grocery outlets.'' Several newspapers, including The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, said the extortionists had demanded $ 1.7 million. The Times said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> was the target, the Telegraph said both <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and Cow and Gate were the targets. The Telegraph said police believe a gang that extorted $ 85,000 from a large supermarket chain this year by threatening to poison food on its shelves turned its attention last month to <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and Cow and Gate.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved on Thursday a fiscal 1990 spending plan designed to carry out a deficit-reduction agreement with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but still reflect congressional plans for domestic programs. The $ 1.17 trillion plan, adopted by a bipartisan vote of 18-6, calls for new user fees, sales of government assets and $ 5.3 billion in unspecified new revenue, while restraining spending growth in defense and in some domestic areas. The budget is designed to reduce the federal deficit next year by roughly $ 27 billion to less than $ 100 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit law. However, even its sponsors described it as only a modest accomplishment. `` There's not a lot of deficit reduction in this package,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., senior Republican on the committee And committee chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he hoped to `` work toward a bolder resolution in the future. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> both participated in the White House talks, and jointly offered the budget adopted by the committee. Earlier, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House might have to seek more spending cuts or taxes as early as this summer if deficit estimates worsen in the next few months. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, after the committee meeting, predicted the budget would pass the House next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> produced its version last week and full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action is also expected next week. The $ 5.3 billion in new revenue called for in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pact remains a matter of contention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that rather than a tax increase the additional revenue would be raised by cutting the rate on capital gains income. The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax committees have given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital-gains proposal little chance of approval, but talks continue. `` There's a five-point-three number hanging out there,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said. A list of proposed user fees in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee version of the budget, obtained by reporters, includes new levies on a wide range of government services. They include fees for inspection of imported foods, charging federal insurance fees for bank deposits held by foreigners, additional levies on the nuclear power industry, and new or extended charges for veterans' home loans and national flood insurance. The two current versions of the budget, which must be reconciled by the two chambers before the budget resolution becomes final, are necessarily similar because of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agreement earlier this month between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders. Military spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 would be about $ 299.2 billion, with total spending authority _ some of which may be spent after the end of the fiscal year _ of $ 305.5 billion. Foreign aid spending would be $ 16.7 billion. Growth in the Medicare program would be trimmed about $ 2.7 billion. There would be no cuts in Social Security benefits. But while overall spending by federal agencies was set by the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had slightly different priorities. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allocated more money for agriculture, energy, transportation and law enforcement programs while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> favored spending on education, health and veterans, according to figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for the most part, did not spell out priorities among those programs, but he agreed in the deficit pact to increase them overall to keep pace with inflation. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee, unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel, produced detailed recommendations on how money would be spent in each area. For examle, <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said the extra money put in the science and space category would allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a chance to keep alive both the space station and superconducting supercollider science projects. Much of what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee decided was done behind closed doors and not revealed during the public session. Those policy choices will be included in the committee report published next week. The press release by the committee touted popular spending in the package. The budget would clear the way for new federal child care and child health and education spending, paent's crime initiative with more money than he requested for the war on drugs, and provide $ 1.9 billion to fight AIDS, it said. Federal civilian and military employees wouldy for the presid get a 3.6 percent pay boost. In its open session, the committee rejected an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, to increase veterans' health spending $ 150 million beyond what was approved in the private meetings. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said the committee level was still well above the level recommended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The budget does not itself authorize federal spending. It serves as the guideline for the annual spending and tax bills that go through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the president. If by Oct. 1 those bills do n't reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit, as projected by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to within $ 10 billion of the Gramm-Rudman target of $ 100 billion, the administration must order automatic spending cuts to make0 .29 0.40 1100 1.42 1.60 1.47 0.25 0.60 0.76 1200 0.80 1.12 1.05 0.65 1.09 1.34 1300 0.44 0.78 0.75 1.27 1.72 2.04 1400 0.24 0.51 0.57 2.07 2.38 s 1500 0.14 0.38 s r s s Estimated volume

 Under a circus tent on the White House lawn, there was a `` three-ring celebration'' of the joys of reading as first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> singled out two children from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for special honors Thursday. Ten-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Amber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> was recognized as winner of the Reading is Fundamental national poster contest, while 11-year-old <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyva </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> won the organization's random drawing in the `` Celebration of Reading'' program. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an adopted Texan, and entertainer-businessman <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, the master of ceremonies, honored the children as part of Reading is Fun Week. Reading Is Fundamental, which Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said will have provided 100 million books to children by the end of the year, sponsored the event and entertainment was provided by Ringing Bros. and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circus </ORGANIZATION> which has a motivational reading program for children. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` After we decided not to have elephants or lion trainers, I only had one other worry. Would my Millie be jealous? `` Millie's my springer spaniel. This is her front yard. She owns the south grounds and the only way that <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> would let me have this big, wonderful party for Reading Is Fundamental was if I promised her her puppies could come to the party.'' She told the 200 children that `` today really is a three-ring celebration, and I want all of you to have a wonderful time because that's what Reading Is Fundamental is all about, having a wonderful time with books.'' `` Next to my family and gardening, I love reading more than anything in life. And it's impossible for me to imagine ever being without books, and that's why reading is very important,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Brady Rejects Proposal to Reduce Medicare Catastrophic Surtax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on Thursday rejected a proposal to reduce <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> `` catastrophic'' health insurance premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a bigger surplus than is needed. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in a letter to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said the insurance program `` is literally in its first few months of life'' and the administration wants to be sure it is not left with insufficient reserves. The new insurance program, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year, provides extended coverage for the costs of hospital and medical care and drug benefits. It is financed through a surtax paid by Social Security recipients. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, last week said he would move to reduce the surtax if the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed with new congressional estimates that the surtax will yield a $ 9.1 billion surplus over a five-year period. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, however, said the administration expects the premiums to yield `` contingency reserves'' of $ 6.2 billion and finds no reason to revise that estimate or to allow for a smaller surplus. `` Until we gain experience with this program, we believe that we must be cautious about funding,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stated in the letter. He added that the administration believes `` the moderate cushion which is currently projected should be maintained.'' Earlier this week, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a letter in which he said it would be `` imprudent to tinker'' with the new Medicare program. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that that reserves could be used only for Medicare and `` can not be diverted to any other program or purpose.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s office said it had not yet received <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s letter and had no immediate comment.

 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> swore in his tough former army commander as prime minister Thursday after widespread rioting and told him to reorganize the government and prepare for <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s first general elections in 22 years State-run <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> TV showed the swearing-in ceremony for <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> and said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> issued 19 directives to the new government, including calls for freedom of the press, support for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and stamping out corruption. But the king also told the government to `` put an end to the involvement of religion in politics,'' an apparent reference to Islamic fundamentalists accused of encouraging the unrest. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON> takes office after the kingdom's worst domestic violence since 1971. Riots stemming from government price increases and economic difficulties killed at least nine people last week in southern <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Government buildings and banks were attacked in dozens of cities and villages. The new government `` will be a temporary one'' charged with `` overseeing the general elections which will take place very soon,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was quoted as telling the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah. The 24-man Cabinet includes seven Palestinian-born men, down from 10 in the previous 26-member cabinet. But that appeared enough to assert <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s continuing claim to represent Palestinians in the kingdom despite his decision to sever ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> last year. Palestinians make up half of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s population of 3 million. The king vowed continued support for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and `` non-interference in their local affairs,'' distancing himself further from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> he ruled until 1967, when it was seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The new government includes nine Cabinet holdovers, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Marwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, 55, a longtime friend and adviser of the king, is best known for his military role in crushing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1970 and 1971. He was armed forces commander in chief until last year, when <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> made him chief of palace advisers and special adviser on security affairs.

He demanded stronger channels of communication between the people and the government, including `` the right of expression and freedom of the press.'' <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, who resigned on Monday, nationalized <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s already docile newspapers during his four-year tenure. The riots were set off by 10 to 50 percent price rises for gasoline and cigarettes and other commodities on top of an economic slide that cut yearly per capita income to about $ 1,200 from $ 2,000. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Seyassah </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as saying `` an accumulation of factors'' led to the four days of riots and that the outgoing government `` was unable to communicate to the public an explanation of the recent economic measures.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` had a hand'' in spurring the riots to draw attention from the 16-month Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories.

 Palestinian enforcers have stepped up a self-policing campaign, targeting Arabs who collaborate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or defy policies of the underground leadership. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report obtained by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said 960 attacks have been carried out on Palestinians by other Arabs with 33 killed and 63 wounded between the start of the uprising in December 1987 and the beginning of April 1989. Six additional Palestinians were killed in recent days, some accused of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others the target of a new underground `` vice squad'' that has singled out drug dealers and prostitutes. On Thursday night, an Arab policeman, <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallil </PERSON>, 37, was stabbed by masked Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nazlat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iza </LOCATION> for continuing to work with the Israeli government despite warnings to quit, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. He was taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for treatment, they said. The pace and severity of such attacks intensified this week as the pro-PLO underground called in an underground leaflet for a `` day of accounting for the collaborators.'' Israeli officials claim Palestinian underground leaders are creating a climate of fear in which moderates are intimidated from speaking freely or challenging the policies of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` We believe such violence has an impact on the voices we can hear coming from the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> population and its leaders. It has an impact on political behavior and expressions,'' said Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. Palestinians reject such claims, saying a wide variety of political views are expressed in public as evidenced by a recent debate on whether Palestinians should agree to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections. `` I do n't think we are in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> where there is a completely free flow of ideas. But considering all the constraints, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have an ample opportunity to give opinions. Look at the elections, people publicly expressed various points of view,'' said <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist. Palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity defended the actions of the clandestine hit teams that `` cleanse the community'' of informers who risk the lives of anti-Israeli activists sought by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security authorities. The most recent victim was <PERSON> Fayek </PERSON> <PERSON> Erar </PERSON>, who allegedly forged deeds and sold land to Israelis. He died in a barrage of bullets fired by three masked men who came to his house in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atiya </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the body of <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadi </PERSON>, 39, was found stabbed and beaten March 25. A leaflet pinned to his chest was signed by the `` strike forces of the State of Palestine'' and said: `` This is the fate of all who collaborate with the Zionists and deal with drugs.'' Palestinians sources who spoke on condition of anonymity fearing reprisal said suspected collaborators were were amply warned and given a chance to repent. They also noted that underground trials were conducted in which testimony was tape recorded. <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, 32, said 10 Palestinian activists, their faces concealed by checkered headdresses, broke into her home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on April 21, beat her and sexually assaulted her. She said in a telephone interview that they demanded information about an acquaintance they suspected of collaborating. `` They stormed into my house carrying sticks and covering their faces. They beat me and threatened to take my life if I did not cooperate and tell them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>, who was hospitalized in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> with bruises on the legs and arms. `` This is the ugly face of the intefadeh,'' said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the deputy army spokesman, using the Arabic word for uprising. `` For some months now, violence and intimidation have been used to enforce the policies and orders of the underground leadership.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report said frequent targets of threats were the 18,000 Palestinians who work for the army-run civil administration, which administers the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. For example, a threatening leaflet from the pro-PLO <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uprising </ORGANIZATION> forced the resignation of 450 Arab policemen, especially after warnings were underlined by the killing of <PERSON> Jericho </PERSON> policeman whose body was left on the doorstep of his house in March 1988. Israeli-appointed mayors, city council members and village leaders were also targeted. Three mukhtars, traditional village leaders, were assassinated in June 1988 and <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> was stabbed in the chest. Noting such attacks predated the uprising, an army briefing paper said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> always regarded the involvement of a local leadership in the territories -LRB- of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> -RRB- as a threat.'' When <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> proposed a ceasefire in the uprising in exchange for prisoner releases and the opening of universities, spray-painted graffiti condemned him as a `` traitor'' and threatened him with death. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> warned anyone trying to stop the revolt `` exposes himself to the bullets of our people.''

<HEAD>Bush Urges US Companies to Work Harder to Prevent Chemicals from
Use in Cocaine</HEAD>

 Using the bully pulpit of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged parents and stockholders Thursday to demand that American companies `` act responsibly'' to prevent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemicals from being used to produce cocaine. `` No chemicals, no cocaine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told an international drug enforcement conference attended by delegates from 30 nations. Cocaine producers use ether, acetone, hydrochloric acid, a chemical known as MEK and other products to refine their drug from coca leaves. `` Few Americans are aware that illegally diverted barrels of dangerous chemicals _ clearly marked with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate logos _ are routinely seized in the jungles of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred in his speech to illegal diversions of chemicals, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies currently are free to sell all their products to other countries. As a result of last year's new drug law, however, federal regulations are being drafted that would require the companies to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> of the ultimate destination and use of export shipments of seven products that could be used in making cocaine, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> would have 15 days to review the paperwork and could stop shipments, he said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said chemical companies have filed a stack of objections four inches high to the rules, but that they were expected to be in place by May 15 anyway. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying the industry `` is already at the front lines'' in the war against drugs. The association, which is made up of companies that manufacture industrial chemicals, said the industry supported passage of last year's anti-drug law. Even before the law was passed, the group said, the industry was already working with law enforcement officials to `` identify and stop illegal shipments of our products.'' Association spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> said his organization's objections center on <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to take actions that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected in previous legislation Primarily, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> wants to require chemical companies to provide detailed reports on their regular customers, while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required only that they list the customers; and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> wants to force the chemical industry to provide statements certifying that the chemicals are being used lawfully, a proposal which he said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also has turned down. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his comments in a speech on the final day of a hectic four-day trek, visiting nine cities in six states from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and back. Although the trip was marred by scheduling problems and did not make much news nationally, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was satisfied. `` He really feels it's important for him to go out and let the folks see the president,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` You just do n't always focus on getting 15 or 30 seconds on the national news.'' More than 100 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers and their supporters demonstrated noisily against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> outside the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hotel where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke. They waved signs with ban-Lorenzo symbols, chanted `` just say no'' and gave a thumbs-down salute to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as his motorcade rode by. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has refused to intervene to end the strike, waved back at them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the drug conference that `` by and large'' the chemical industry has supported efforts to halt the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemicals. `` We've been getting good support from most of the chemical industry.'' However, he said, `` industry's got to do more. `` And I hope that parents' groups and stockholders are listening today. We should demand that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> corporations act responsibly and that they not tolerate their chemicals ending up in criminal hands.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would like to see `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical manufacturers demonstrate their courage and civic responsibility by entering into a true partnership with our government as we try to stop narcotics at the source.'' `` These companies can make an important contribution to our nation's fight against illegal drugs. They should make it their job to join in.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters that the chemical companies deserve recognition for their voluntary efforts. However, he said, `` There's no question that there are still some strange purchases of chemicals that take place.'' Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was suggesting complicity by some drug companies in the use of chemicals to refine cocaine, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't think that was the suggestion at all. It's just a call for additional cooperation above and beyond the normal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the products used to produce cocaine are `` chemical time bombs.'' In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, for example, he said 175,000 pounds of sulfuric acid are dumped each year into tributaries of the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` Anyone concerned about the legacy of defoliation in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> ought to go see what illegally diverted chemicals are beginning to do to the Andes right now,'' he said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, drug agents busted a houseboat lab on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that was dumping hydrochloric acid and other waste into water within splashing distance of children swimming, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Today I pledge to you that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will lead the fight against illicit shipments of precursor chemicals,'' the president said. He said drug-producing nations _ in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ and drug-consuming nations _ chiefly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ should stop blaming each other for the drug scourge. `` Ultimately, the solution to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> drug problem lies within our own borders: stepped-up enforcement, education and treatment as well.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that casual cocaine users `` can no longer claim non-combatant status'' in the war on drugs. `` There is blood on their hands.'' He said that realization `` has begun to sear the consciences of the stockbrokers and the students, the lawyers and the homemakers and the athletes who finance our common enemy.'' In a separate appearance in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dedicated a high-tech center run by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to spot drug traffickers in the air and at sea. `` Think of this as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drug war situation rooms, as our early warning network against narcotics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to dedicate a 51-bed care center at a retirement center for victims of Alzheimers Disease.

<HEAD>Pinochet Changes Education, Mining Ministers But Keeps Interior Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s office said Thursday he will name new ministers of education and mining, but it indicated no plans to replace Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> Local press and radio had predicted <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>' departure in a conflict with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> over proposed democratic reforms. On Wednesday, Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> asked all 15 members of his Cabinet to hand in their resignations to give him `` freedom of action'' in making changes, a spokesman said. On Thursday, his press office said he accepted the resignations only of Education Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> and Mining Minister <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraona </PERSON>. According to local press reports that the government has not denied, <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> disagreed over the extent of proposed amendments to the 1980 Constitution and other legal reforms sought by the opposition. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> has been negotiating the changes with civilian politicians, and he said last week he is ready to make a firm proposal for the changes. The reforms would include modifying a constitutional ban on Marxism and altering <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a powerful military-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition parties are pressing for the reforms before scheduled Dec. 14 national elections to pick a successor to <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, seized power in a 1973 coup. He proposed in a referendum last October to remain in power until 1997. Voters rejected the proposal, obliging him to call elections. <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> was named interior minister, the top political position in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, shortly after the referendum. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, spokesman for an opposition coalition of 17 parties, said the retention of <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> is `` probably a good indication, showing a willingness by the government to reach an agreement on constitutional changes.'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Allamand </PERSON>, secretary general of the pro-goverment <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renovation </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s decision to keep <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON> `` guarantees that there will be substantial constitutional changes.''

<HEAD>Soviets Want More Grain Than U.S. Will Sell, Congressman Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The federal government on Thursday raised the amount of grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can purchase this year to 24 million metric tons, but a farm state congressman said Soviet negotiators are n't happy with the deal. The Soviets, who previously had a limit of 20 million tons on the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain they could buy this year, wanted to expand the amount to 30 million tons under the Export Enhancement Program, said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON>, who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators told the Soviets they could not use the subsidy program. Attempts to contact Soviet officials at their embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, press secretary to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, said the agreement does not stipulate whether the Export Enhancement Program will be used during the sale. She said the talks were about the amount of grain the Soviets could buy, not its price. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last week that <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> sales had been put on hold pending a budget review, an announcement that stirred controversy for the program. The program is popular with foreign buyers because it makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities cheaper. It also helps the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stay competitive with countries that heavily subsidize their exports. But no <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> applications have been processed since the end of February. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they have tried unsuccessfully to find out whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has suspended the program as part of negotiations in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round trade talks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position at those talks is that all countries should remove or drastically reduce subsidies on their exports. <PERSON> Shipp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said the program has been slowed down because of weather and stock conditions and because there is a new administration, but it has not been suspended. She noted that domestic wheat supplies are lower than they have been in 15 years and the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> program draws on those stocks. <PERSON> Nagle </PERSON> said his sources told him Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Wednesday, assured the Australians that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was backing off the export subsidy program. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> also wants other countries to remove such subsidies and has been pursuing that end even more aggressively than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also announced Thursday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 150,000 metric tons of corn for delivery this year under its long-term supply agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for delivery in 1988-89 to more than 13.2 million tons. In addition to the wheat and corn, sales include 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 of grain sorghum. The latest corn sale and the other grain is for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement. The original agreement said the Soviets could purchase 12 million tons of grain, but would be able to come back periodically to request more.

 <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the black teen-ager who made national headlines after claiming she was abducted and raped by a gang of white men, admitted to her boyfriend that she and her mother made up the story, a newspaper reported Thursday. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> made the admission two weeks ago to <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 19, who became her boyfriend a few weeks before the alleged abduction in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> on Nov. 24, 1987, when <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was 15, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday reported. A grand jury concluded last year that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who was found in a plastic garbage bag, smeared with feces and with racial epithets scrawled on her body, had faked being raped. The Newsday story `` tends to corroborate everything that the grand jury discovered and the conclusions it reached,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, speaking for state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor who handled the case. <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said that although there no longer was a question of criminal prosecution in the case, the attorney general wanted to interview <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to confirm the story because `` it would be in the public interest and satisfying to everyone to fill in some of the final pieces.'' The story, written by <PERSON> Newsday </PERSON>'s assistant managing editor, <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, was denounced in a radio interview by two of Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s advisers, <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and the Rev <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>. They accused the newspaper of trying to divert attention from what they called white establishment lies about the recent <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> gang rape case. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, denied the account and said she had n't seen <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> since last summer, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> told <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> that she and her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, invented the story to keep <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, her mother's lover, from beating the girl <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and two lawyers, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, kept Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her mother away from the grand jury while conducting a publicity campaign that depicted the state investigation as a coverup to protect the rapists, among whom they alleged were a police officer and an assistant district attorney. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said the Newsday story, coming as the Central Park `` wilding'' rampage by black youths unfolds, was meant to deflect the public from making comparisons `` between how the justice system responds to the rape of a black girl and the rape of a white woman.'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, sounding the same theme in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION>, said that so far there `` has n't been any evidence of a rape or of this woman being assaulted or attacked at all'' in Central Park. `` We do n't even know if she's over at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> or not,'' yet that is accepted as true, while Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s case is branded a hoax, <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice on Thursday sentenced to death three uniformed guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for four killings and a bombing at a bus stop. The men refused to take part in their trial, saying they were prisoners of war. They wore olive-green military uniforms with <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colors throughout the proceedings at the farming town of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, one read a statement on behalf of himself and his comrades which said in part: `` We are soldiers in a patriotic army struggling to establish democracy and peace. We believe that we are prisoners of war.'' The court let the men's families present evidence in mitigation of sentence when the men themselves would not. The defendants were convicted of murder on March 2, making the death penalty mandatory unless mitigating circumstances were shown. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Marius </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> found none existed. He sentenced <PERSON> Jabu </PERSON> <PERSON> Masina </PERSON>, 36, <PERSON> Ting-Ting </PERSON> <PERSON> Masango </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Neo </PERSON> <PERSON> Potsane </PERSON>, 27, for murdering two black policemen, a black town councilor, and the councilor's sister-in law. No execution date was set. The three also were sentenced to 25 years in prison for attempted murder in a 1986 bus stop bombing that injured 17 people and in setting a mine on a road used mainly by military vehicles. A fourth defendant, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhura </PERSON>, 26, drew 25 years in prison in connection with the bombing and mining. <PERSON> Masina </PERSON> read a statement on Tuesday that said: `` We say that the present South African government has no authority, no moral or legal right to rule over the people of this country. It is therefore our duty to bring this crime to an end, to remove this illegal state. `` If we are hanged, our death will not be in vain. Those who come after us will undoubtedly complete our mission in life.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinsloo </PERSON> said the men committed `` planned, cold-blooded murders'' in pursuit of political objectives.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended an era in its manned space program Thursday when three cosmonauts returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, leaving the Mir space station empty for the first time in more than two years. A Soyuz TM-7 capsule carrying <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> landed about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dzhezkazgan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The suspension of the Mir mission, the showpiece of the Soviet space program, comes one day before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to launch its Atlantis space shuttle with a crew of five. Mir, designed for permanent occupancy, will remain empty until another rocket launch scheduled in August. Officials said the respite will save money at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is struggling with a $ 160 billion deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> called the touchdown of the Soyuz capsule soft, but <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, on the evening news program `` Vremya,'' called it `` not one of the softest.'' `` There was a double touchdown. The apparatus landed, then jumped from the ground and we were turned over several times. In general, the blows could be felt. Probably the bruises will remain,'' <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> suffered the most because he hit a capsule control panel, the TV reporter said without elaboration. In the TV report, <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> appeared to be the most shaken and pale of the three cosmonauts, and <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, a doctor, was shown treating him aboard a plane flight to <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. There was no explanation what went wrong or why <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the landing was soft. <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> had been in space for five months. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> remained aboard Mir for eight months after a joint Afghan-Soviet flight to study the effects of long-term space flight on the crew. A replacement crew was orginally due to arrive at the Mir station April 19 to keep the station manned, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said `` a delay with the preparation of the new modules forced a revision of the plan.'' The respite will allow scientists a chance to review scientific data, complete work on two unfinished station modules and give ground controllers vacations, space officials said last week. In August, cosmonauts will return to Mir for a six-month stint that will include overseeing the addition of a new research module and a service module, officials said. The additions will double the space station's weight to 100 tons, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Since its launch in 1986, Mir has been home to four resident crews, including the record-breaking yearlong stay by cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in December. Cosmonaut <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gzhenebekov </PERSON> told Soviet TV the landing required `` little corrections,'' but there were no major problems like those that cropped up during the last two landings. In September, an Afghan and Soviet cosmonaut were forced to postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for a day because of equipment problems and crew errors. They touched down safely a day late, but were running dangerously low on food and air. During the return of <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> in December, the cosmonauts had to spend an additional three hours orbiting Earth in their descent module because of a computer problem, the Soviet media reported.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Bullet That Killed Rowe Found `Soft Spot' In Armor</HEAD>

 The assassin's bullet that killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> passed through a soft-spot in his armored car, the Pentagon announced Thursday. Spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> told reporters that the slaying of <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> on his way to work in suburban <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> last Friday demonstrated the limits of the precautions the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military can take to protect its personnel overseas. `` Our bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> have had a heightened state of alert for over a year and a half now since three Americans were shot outside of <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` That alert status continues. And of course, the shooting has reemphasized the need for all of our people to be especially vigilant.'' `` Other than the heightened alert, there is a limit to what can be done.'' he said. The car in which <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> was riding was armored, he said, but `` perhaps there's misunderstanding about what an armored vehicle is. ... It's an ordinary passenger automobile which has been provided with some types of protection. It is not an M1A1 tank.'' Thick plexiglass is applied to the windows, and armored plates are in the doors as well as extra shielding in the floor, he said. `` But it is not a completely secure conveyance,'' he said. `` And if someone fires armor-piercing rounds with an automatic weapon at the vehicle, it can find a soft spot. It's not impervious to that sort of an attack.'' In fact, the bullet that killed <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> `` was not an armor-piercing round,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` The round bullet that entered the <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> vehicle went through what they call a non-hardened area around the window frame.'' Police in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> said hooded gunmen sprayed <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s car with an M-16 rifle and a .45 - caliber The communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the slaying. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 51, was chief of the ground forces of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which provides training and logistical support to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military. `` We use these armored vehicles all over the world, at our embassies and the like, military installations, as do many, many other governments,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said, adding that there was no investigation under way to see whether the <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> vehicle was deficient. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said no special precautions were being taken in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as a result of the slaying. `` It's been a general precaution area there,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has a long history of terrorist activity against citizens of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. They have occasionally turned their violence on foreigners. `` We had three military personnel killed a year and a half ago. There have been some other incidents, one of which was ... the blowing up of some radio towers. But there's no indication of a widespread campaign.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have alerted Americans in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, adding, `` We have a great many people there.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he did n't know whether special investigators had been sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the case. `` Obviously, this is sovereign territory of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We are cooperating with the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> authorities. And we are pleased with the high level of cooperation that we're getting, trying to investigate the matter. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> would be buried Monday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Arlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, following a private funeral in Ft.. Myer Memorial Chapel

 An alleged assault on <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> by neo-Nazis did not happen as the TV talk show host reported it did, and may be a fabrication, authorities said Thursday. `` The facts certainly did not happen the way Mr. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said they happened. We can not substantiate any of his claims ... either way,'' said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, star of his confrontational `` shock TV'' talk show, said he was attacked by skinheads in a restroom at the airport Monday night. He said they tried to shave his head and scribbled reversed swastikas on his face, sweatshirt and pants. Since the initial report and <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s interviews with local reporters while still sporting the Nazi insignias, police have tried unsuccessfully to verify his story, fueling speculation that the skinhead story was a publicity stunt. `` There's just a lot of inconsistencies, and apparently his story changes as time goes on,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Asked if investigators determined the attack was faked, he replied, `` I do n't want to make that flat statement. ... It certainly leaves a lot of suspicions as far as I'm concerned.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Langan </PERSON>, a former producer, writer and road manager for `` The <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> Jr.. Show,'' said in Thursday editions of The Record of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> told him last month he would attempt a stunt to bolster sagging ratings `` He said he thought it would get him national attention,'' said <PERSON> Langan </PERSON>, who left the show in December. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON>, a talk show host at KBX-TV in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he spoke with <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> on Sunday about his trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he had been threatened by skinheads and the gay community `` and at one point he told me, and I'm pretty sure this is a quote, ` I'm a little concerned about what might happen at the airport.''' Asked about a possible publicity stunt, show spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know. I do n't know anything. There is no official comment right now.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Giguiere </PERSON> said that filing a false police report is a misdemeanor in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But he said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> declined police inquiries, did n't want a report filed and refused to be examined. Investigators have been unable to find anyone to corroborate <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s story, he said. `` This indicates to me that there is a possibility it -LRB- the attack -RRB- was fabricated, certainly,'' <PERSON> Guiguiere </PERSON> said. `` If that's show biz, you can have it. `` The <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Show,'' formerly one of television's most talked-about programs, has suffered a ratings collapse in recent It ranks No. 82 in the season-to-date syndicated television ratings. In addition to the ABC-owned station in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, stations in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> have announced that they have canceled the show because of decreased ratings, lack of advertiser support or consumer complaints. The half-hour show, which had its debut nationally last September, features <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> debating with _ and shouting at _ various in-studio visitors.

<TEXT>
 Four House Democrats on Thursday called for the appointment of an outside counsel to investigate allegations that Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules in his financial dealings. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., filed a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee earlier this month alleging 10 apparent rule violations in the formation and operation of a limited partnership set up to promote a 1984 book co-authored by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> But Reps. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, are asking Democratic colleagues to support their letter to the ethics panel chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., calling for an outside counsel In the letter to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, the Democrats said such an appointment to investigate the charges against <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> would `` preserve the integrity of the committee's consideration process from politicization and outside pressure.'' The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a formal investigation of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint, which was filed as the committee neared the end of the investigation <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> initiated of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> earlier this week denied any wrongdoing in connection with the partnership and released nearly 400 pages of documents detailing its financial and incorporation history. The partnership was formed with $ 5,000 investments from 18 individuals and three corporations. Many of the investors were wealthy Republicans who regularly contributed to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s campaigns In return for promoting the book, the partnership was to have received half the publisher's profits, but the publisher lost money and the investors ended up with tax writeoffs. Earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> used a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon to outline the message of Democratic corruption and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opportunity that he has used to propel himself into the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership. He said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> must build a `` caring, humanitarian, reform'' party to offer voters an alternative to a Democratic party that is `` committed to propping up a system that's dying.'' `` Every conservative in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must confront the reality that the great age of opposition conservatism is over,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the argument and now the country wants us to govern. We must come up with a wave of reforms of extraordinary scale.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who instigated the investigation that resulted in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s being the first speaker ever charged with violating <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, said that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must undergo dramatic change to meet the challenges of the 1990s, and that change must be focused on the system rather than on personalities. `` I do n't think any person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can look at our competitive situation in the world market, can look at the pressures of high technology, can look at the rate of change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and then turn to our major cities and not come to the conclusion that we are on the verge of absolutely catastrophic decay in the 1990s,'' he said. The reasons for that decay, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> argued, are drugs and violent crime, the collapse of education systems in major cities, the inability of unionized city bureaucracies to meet the needs of the urban poor, the penetration of labor unions and city governments by organized crime and the Democratic domination of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Democrats have so insulated themselves on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that Soviet provincial leaders were 16 times more likely to be defeated this year than were incumbent members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is a fundamental insult to the constitutional freedoms of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and it is nothing more than a game written on Capitol Hill by a left-wing party that knows it can not possibly survive in fair elections in this country, and therefore they cheat every day,'' he said. As an example of such `` Democratic cheating,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> cited franking rules that he said permitted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to spend `` more money last year on franked mail than every challenger for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> spent on everything.''

<HEAD>Ramon Salcido's Ex-Wife Recounts Violence and Fear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first wife of confessed mass slayer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> said the former winery worker terrorized her and once threatened to kill her, a newspaper reported Thursday. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 27, hid in terror during the three days and nights her ex-husband was on the run and says that if their daughter asks about her father, she will tell her he is dead, according to a report in The <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> Bee. `` When she comes of age I do n't know what I'm going to tell her,'' <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> said of the couple's 4-year-old daughter, who does not know who her father is. `` I ca n't tell her her father's a killer. If I can do it, I'm going to tell her he's dead. I hope by then he will be.'' After learning that her ex-husband was suspected of the slayings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s picturesque wine country, she fled with her daughter and a 3-year-old son from a subsequent marriage. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> has been accused of slashing or shooting to death seven people on April 14, including his wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, two of his three young daughters, his mother-in-law, two young sisters-in-law and his boss. He is being held in isolation in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. In her only interview since the slayings, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> described the frequent beatings she experienced during her brief marriage to the man who now faces possible execution if convicted of his alleged crimes. One incident occurred in late 1983 or early 1984 at the couple's home in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, during which she said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s alcohol-fueled temper `` He got me onto the floor and put his knees on my arms,'' she said. `` He took a pair of scissors and put them right to my throat and said ` I could kill you,''' while dripping saliva on her face. On another occasion, she said, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> came home drunk, and when she refused to say where she had been that day, he took a .22 - caliber rifle from beneath the sofa and waved it Three weeks later, after she learned she was pregnant, she left <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>. During the agonizing international manhunt for the suspected killer, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> moved with her family to a <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> motel, where they learned that <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s three daughters were found with their throats slit in a county dump. Only one of the victims, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, survived the attack. Panicked, Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had a friend pick up her daughter. In the years since the couple's separation and divorce, Mrs. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had a son by a man who was murdered in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in January 1986. After she moved to <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and began collecting welfare, the local district attorney pressed for child support from <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> for care of the couple's little girl. Authorities believe this dispute may have ignited the rage that led to the murders. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> confessed to the slayings after he was captured April 19 in his native <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Following the killings, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s blood-spattered car was found with a note that read, in Spanish: `` Forgive me God, but this law made me do it. We could live better, me and my children, but what can I do.'' <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, called <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> about five weeks ago and asked why <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> had filed the complaint, which sought $ 5,807 in back payments and monthly payments of $ 511, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> asked whether I would be willing to go to the DA's office and say that the child was not his and that I had made a mistake on the birth certificate,'' said <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, who refused the request Her account contradicts earlier reports that <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> was unaware until the day before the murders that <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> had been married previously. Investigators have also speculated that the motive for the killings was <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s belief that <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> was having an affair.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Presents Budget Amid Calls For Resignation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Figures are in U.S. dollars.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> delivered a widely criticized federal budget to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, and opposition members walked out to protest the leak of the budget to the media a day earlier. The combination of a new 9 percent sales tax on most goods and services, higher income and corporate taxes and spending cuts disappointed taxpayers, labor organizations and business groups. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> released the budget late Wednesday night after leaked details were broadcast by Global Television. Commons Speaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> went so far as to suspend the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether to allow <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to present his budget. He later permitted <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to present it despite protests from the opposition Liberals and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who said the finance minister had soiled parliamentary tradition by refusing to resign after the leak. Only one opposition member, the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, remained in the House for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s 10-minute speech. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> defended his finance minister, blaming an unidentified bureaucrat for the leak, and said he would not accept his resignation. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said the leak `` did not result from negligence ... or lack of proper security arrangements'' and its premature release appeared to have resulted from `` a breach of trust, a willful criminal act.'' The budget itself, which has a $ 26.5 billion deficit, did little to improve the stature of <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a 51-year-old <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> stockbroker, within the Canadian business community. `` What a mockery is going to be made of us on the world stage,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wateridge </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION>. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> called it a disappointment and a lost opportunity for deficit reduction. The budget called for increased taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline as well as increases of $ 1 billion in corporate taxes and $ 1.2 billion in personal taxes. Plans to develop a nuclear-powered submarine fleet will be shelved under a strategy to save $ 2.2 billion in defense spending over the next five years. In addition, 14 military bases across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are to be closed or scaled down. Under the $ 6.7 billion submarine program, the government was considering building 10 to 12 vessels according to designs purchased from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ for its Rubis-Amethyste-class boat _ or from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, for its Trafalgar-class vessel. The budget promises to cut the $ 26.5 billion deficit in half by 1993-94. It drastically shrinks the proposed national child-care program. About $ 1.9 billion in tax breaks for parents will remain, but $ 3.4 billion cost-sharing proposal with the Canadian provinces will be put on hold. The leak resulted in the government's rushing out the budget and forced <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to dismantle careful plans to release the budget in its most favorable light. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> blamed an unidentified whistle-blower who he said leaked the budget to a television reporter. Responding to calls for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s resignation, he shouted across the floor to opponents, `` You should be worried about the guy who stole the property.'' Liberal leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> sharply criticized <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> for not resigning. He said the rights of every Canadian had been violated because the leak might have been used for personal gain by those who had advance notice of the budget contents. Neither Turner nor any other opposition member had any evidence that anyone gained from the budget leak. New Democrat Leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s credibility `` is now completely shot'' and that the government should withdraw the budget and present another one later. Investigations were being conducted Thursday into the possibility that people used the advance information in the budget to make profits on the stock market. Police were questioning anyone involved in printing the budget. Supply Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> told the Commons that `` every single individual'' among the more than 200 people involved in printing the budget had been cleared to handle secret material.

<HEAD>President Bush's Elm Tree Came With Tiny Bugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An American elm tree President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planted on the state Capitol grounds amid great fanfare this week came with some uninvited guests _ tiny bugs a forester said could be destructive gypsy moth larvae. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was guest of honor at a tree-planting ceremony Monday afternoon, brought along the elm, which he said was a descendant of a tree President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> planted on the White House grounds. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumhardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> city forester, reluctantly confirmed several tiny, caterpillar-like bugs were picked off the tree after it was planted. `` The tree was n't unwrapped two minutes when we noticed it,'' <PERSON> Blumhardt </PERSON> said Wednesday. He believes the critters are gypsy moth larvae, but tests to determine exactly what they are were not finished, <PERSON> Blumhardt </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's worth causing embarrassment to the president,'' the forester said. `` He'll say, ` The next time I'm invited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, to hell with them.' The ceremony was part of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s celebration of its 100th anniversary of statehood. Officials hope to plant 100 million trees in the state by the year 2,000 as part of the celebration. The gypsy moth is common in the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Its larvae, which can grow to more than 2 inches long, defoliate trees by eating the leaves. The bugs found on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s elm tree were less than an eighth of an inch long, so tiny a microscope was used to get a good look at them, <PERSON> Blumhardt </PERSON> said. The forester said the visible bugs were picked off the tree, and it was sprayed with an insecticide, as was the truck the tree was transported in and the burlap in which it was wrapped. In six or seven weeks, monitoring traps will be set up around the tree to make sure there are not any adult gypsy moths around, <PERSON> Blumhardt </PERSON> said.

 Despite shellfire still rocking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s rival <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem governments and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> declared support for the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s call on Thursday for a cease-fire to halt the seven-week bloodbath. Their separate statements came as Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners dueled with mortars and rockets across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> _ well after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foreign ministers appealed at their meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> for a truce in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. One man was killed and two were wounded in the fighting, which sent thousands of people scurrying for cover in basements and underground bomb shelters. The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> under army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> pledged to cooperate with a 312-man observer force the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> will send here to monitor the cease-fire, called for noon Friday -LRB- 6 a.m. EDT -RRB-. `` It is a modest step in the right direction to lift the Syrian hegemony off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said a statement issued by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s three-man military <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> after a late-night session. The Cabinet welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> call to lift air, land and sea blockades imposed in the latest round of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. It ordered that <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, closed since March 12, be reopened simultaenously with the cease-fire deadline. The Aoun Cabinet also said it will ask the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to `` work out a mechanism to implement its Resolution 425 which calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw'' from a border strip it occupies in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Rival acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads a mainly Moslem Cabinet, issued a statement in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> pledging full cooperation with the Arab League observer force. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the government of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> was `` satisified with resolutions announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' It quoted unidentified observers as saying the resolutions were tantamount to a `` slap to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and his isolationist, Zionist gang.'' Whether the carnage actually would stop after Thursday's welcoming statements by the warring factions was another question Three previous cease-fire calls by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> failed to halt the fighting. The 22-member Arab League's effort to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s worst outbreak of violence in four years came at a two-day emergency meeting in the Tunisian capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000-strong army has been locked since March 8 in ferocious fighting with an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse Moslem militiamen. By police count, 273 people have been killed and 993 wounded in the clashes. Most of the victims have been civilians who fell in the indiscriminate shelling of population centers in and around the capital. Radio stations in the Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> interrupted regular programming Thursday to broadcast the Arab League resolutions. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has been insisting that the Arab League make a direct reference to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> involvement in the fighting, instead of portraying the crisis as one between Lebanese Christains and Moslems. He also wants the League to pressure <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw an estimated 40,000 troops stationed in Moslem regions under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> final statement in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> said an observer force, to be commanded by a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officer, would deploy along the demarcation line between the battling factions, keep points of passage open and identify the party responsible for any violation. It said the League would make $ 3 million available immediately to cover start-up costs for the observers, and that full financing from member countries should be put in place by May 10. The mission was set for three months. Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharaa </PERSON> told reporters <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was ready to give any aid requested by a special six-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee charged with resolving the civil war. Fighting broke out two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> clamped a blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an attempt to restore the long-eroded authority of the state. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. The Syrians later joined the bombardment and besieged the Christians.

<HEAD>Dutch War Criminal Dies After His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON>, a war criminal jailed for 43 years for his role in deporting tens of thousands of Dutch Jews to Nazi extermination camps, died less than three months after his release from a Dutch prison, Dutch television reported Thursday. He was 79. The report, attributed to the prison warden, said <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> eight days ago and has already been buried, but it gave no details. A telephone operator at the prison in <LOCATION> Breda </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> served his term after World War II, said the warden was not available for comment. Aus der <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> was released and expelled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Jan. 27 with another convicted war criminal, 87-year-old <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. Known as the `` Breda Two,'' they were the world's longest-held war criminals. Their release followed an unusual vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and brought angry protest by the nation's still-vocal organizations of resistance fighters. During the war, <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> was an SS administrator of a body that oversaw the mass deportations of Dutch Jews. Of a prewar population of 100,000 Dutch Jews, only 10,000 returned from the death camps. A Dutch court sentenced <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> to death in 1950, but his sentence was commuted the same year. In the parliamentary debate that resulted in their release, Justice Minister <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Korthals </PERSON> <PERSON> Altes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Aus </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuenten </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> were `` symbols of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> evil and an unending source of of sorrow and strife. ... Let's rid our society of the miserable remainder of the two war criminals' lives.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> on Thursday denied claims made by his longtime companion <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> in a lawsuit that contended the tough-guy actor promised to support her for life but has kicked her out. `` I am deeply disappointed and saddened that she's taken this kind of action,'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> said in a statement issued by publicist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelman </PERSON>. `` It will soon come to light that these accusations are unfounded and without merit, however, this matter will be dealt with in an appropriate legal arena. Beyond that I have no comment,'' <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, 41, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeking unspecified damages, title to the two homes and an equal division of property acquired during the couple's 10-year relationship. The lawsuit also claims <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, 58, persuaded Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, an actress and director, to undergo two abortions and a sterility operation because he did not want children. Miss <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, nominated for an Academy Award for the 1968 movie, `` The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,'' co-starred with <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> in `` Gauntlet'' `` The <LOCATION> Outlaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Josey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>'' and several other movies.

<HEAD>Resolution Calls 20 Deaths in Soviet Georgia a Criminal Act</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS spelling to Sagdeyev throughout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution last week declaring that the deaths of 20 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> constituted a `` criminal act'' that signaled danger to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> reforms, a prominent Soviet space scientist said Thursday. <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>, a Soviet reformer elected last month to the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>' Deputies, released the text of the resolution here. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> was one of three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, along with human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> historian <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON>, who were elected to the congress and agreed to serve on a parliamentary investigating panel. `` The tragic events in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> -LRB- capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> -RRB- confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger,'' said the resolution, using the Russian name for Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. Special uniformed troops under the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, or MVD, were responsible for using poisonous chemicals, shovels and clubs to suppress the demonstrations in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on April 9, killing 20 people, the statement said. `` This unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and outrage of our entire society,'' said the resolution, which <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said was passed at a meeting of the entire <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> April 21. `` It completely contradicts'' the reform program, `` is completely incompatible with the accepted moral and legal norms of a civilized government, and must be seen as a criminal act against the people,'' the resolution said. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said the events in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> were especially troubling because `` it was the suppression of ethnic Georgians by ethnic Russian troops'' from the city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Ethnic Russians form about half the 280 million population in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and their political power is far greater than the numbers would suggest. Much of the unrest that has gripped the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to power four years ago has come from residents of the 14 non-Russian republics who, like the Georgians who demonstrated, would like greater autonomy from Russian rule. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, newly appointed after the April 9 deaths, has confirmed reports that some of the demonstrators were killed by a toxic gas, the exact nature of which has not been disclosed. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said it appeared final approval for using the <ORGANIZATION> MVD </ORGANIZATION> troops against the demonstrators came from local officials in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` I do not think we should put all the blame on central authorities,'' he said. Unrest in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> took a violent turn in part because of young extremists among the demonstrators and in part because local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials were out of step with the populace, he said. Far larger demonstrations in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> by and large have not resulted in violence, with the exception of a police crackdown in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in September 1988 that resulted in no deaths but led to the removal of the local party chief. `` I think that there is much better understanding in the Baltic republics between the communist authorities and the popular fronts'' which have been formed there, he said. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said the paramilitary anti-riot units involved in the Georgian violence were formed under the <ORGANIZATION> MVD </ORGANIZATION> last July after the Supreme Soviet drafted legislation banning anti-Soviet demonstrations. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> was one of 31 members of the Supreme Soviet or parliament who voted against the legislation when it was passed last October. <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> said he viewed the law as a threat to reform and would seek to have it repealed. `` The anti-perestroika forces are becoming stronger and more active than we would like to believe. Their main weapon is the concealment and distortion of truthful information,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> resolution, which was drafted in large part by <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, consolidated his rule on Tuesday by accepting the resignations of 74 aged voting members of the 301-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Those who resigned had lost the party or government jobs that had won them spots on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and were viewed widely as potential threats to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform.

<HEAD>Actor George Coulouris Dies At 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON>, who played cold-hearted lawyer <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in the 1941 <LOCATION> Orson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Welles </LOCATION>' movie classic `` Citizen Kane'' and specialized in villains throughout his career, has died, his wife said Thursday. English-born Coulouris, who spent more than 20 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and worked in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in its heyday, died Tuesday of heart failure brought on by <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> said from their north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> home. His notable roles included a blackmailing Romanian count in the 1943 movie `` Watch on the Rhine,'' a Nazi posing as a Belgian patriot in `` The Master Race'' in 1944, a treacherous territorial magnate in the 1946 western `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' and the bogus psychiatrist who invites <PERSON> Claudette </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> to commit suicide in `` Sleep My Love'' in 1948. Later films in which he appeared included <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s `` An Outcast of the Islands'' in 1951, `` Papillon'' in 1973, `` Mahler'' in 1974, and `` Murder on the <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>'' also in 1974. <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> was also an accomplished stage actor. In the 1930s, he appeared with the Mercury Theater company founded by <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>, and gave arresting stage performances in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as a ruthless agent in <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Odet </PERSON>'s `` The Big Knife'' in 1954 and as Gen. <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> in <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochhuth </PERSON>'s controversial `` Soldiers'' in 1968. Born Oct. 1, 1903 to a <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> father and English mother in <LOCATION> Salford </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> ran away from home to become an actor against his businessman father's wishes. Tall, impressive and with powerful hooded eyes, he attended the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speech </ORGANIZATION> and Drama in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, studying with <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>. He made his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage debut in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> V'' in 1926, went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1929 and landed his first major stage roles. He made friends with Welles while appearing in the Broadway play `` Ten Million Ghosts'' and later recalled in an interview how he delighted in taking the American actor, producer and director `` down a peg or two.'' In 1943, <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> mounted and starred in his own Broadway production of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'' but for once his relish for villainy took him too far. One critic described him playing the evil hunchback king as `` a screen <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugosi </PERSON> crossed with a grand-opera Quasimodo.'' In the early 1950s, <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> returned to live in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, joining the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vic </LOCATION> theater company where he played the name role in French playwright <PERSON> Moliere </PERSON>'s famous 17th century comedy `` Tartuffe.'' In 1970 he played Big Daddy in a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage production of <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>' `` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' He appeared in many British films, stepping out of his sinister acting persona to play comedy in the 1954 movie `` Doctor in the House.'' In the the 1960s and 1970s he tried his hand at horror movies, appearing in `` The Skull'' in 1965, `` Blood of the Mummy's Tomb'' in 1971 and `` The Antichrist'' in 1975. <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON> once told an interviewer: `` I'm never in line for an ordinary part _ an English barrister -LRB- lawyer -RRB-, say, with some sensible line to deliver. Some silly bastard always says: <PERSON> Coulouris </PERSON>? He's a foreigner, is n't he?'' He once listed his favorite stage roles as Othello, <PERSON> Macbeth </PERSON> and King <PERSON> Lear </PERSON>. The large, powerful performer disliked television, claiming its small screen restricted an actor's range. `` Television has wrecked acting because it's impossible to make a stirring success,'' he said in an interview. He is survived by a son and a daughter from his first wife, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, who died in 1976.

<HEAD>Physicians' Marriages Among Most Stable, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contrary to widespread opinion, physicians' marriages are among the most stable in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a new study based on census data The proportion of physicians who were divorced in 1980 was significantly lower than the proportion of men and women in other occupations who were divorced, said the study, published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But compulsive personality traits among physicians result in many having discordant and unhappy marriages _ even those that do n't end in divorce, suggests a report accompanying the study. The report describes the marital problems observed among 320 couples attending workshops for physicians and their families. The study, however, said a review of scientific literature fails to support the belief that physicians' marriages are poorer in quality than those of others. Many books and articles portray physicians as poor marriage partners due to what is described as a compulsive need to work long hours, a need to feel all-powerful and inattentiveness to their spouses, the authors wrote. But no sound evidence exists that physicians have marriages of lower quality than other groups, said the authors, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` The bulk of the large body of literature regarding physicians' marriages, while humanly interesting and challenging in its damaging portrait of medical marriages, lack minimum scientific standards for drawing generalizations about physicians as a group,'' the authors wrote The 1980 census data analyzed in their study involved a sample of 74,822 male and 11,462 female physicans. The proportion of male physicians who were divorced was 43 per 1,000, 22 percent lower than the 55 per 1,000 proportion for the rest of the employed male population, the authors said. The proportion of men divorced in other professional specialities was also 55 per 1,000 and was 56 per 1,000 for male lawyers and judges. The proportion of female physicians who were divorced in 1980 was 82 per 1,000, 23 percent lower than the 106 per 1,000 for the rest of the employed female population. Females in other professional specialties had a significantly higher proportion -LRB- 93 per 1,000 -RRB- who were divorced, and the proportion of female physicians divorced was 35 percent lower than than the proportion -LRB- 127 per 1,000 -RRB- of female lawyers and judges divorced, the authors said. The accompanying report said, however, that physicians' marriages are often characterized by a `` strategy of postponement,'' in which physicians continually put off participating in family life In coping with the demands of medical education and then practice itself, physicians learn to postpone gratification, commitment and intimacy, said the authors, Dr. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbard </PERSON> of the C.F. <ORGANIZATION> Menninger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and Dr. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menninger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Menninger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>.

 Shining Path guerrillas shot and killed a leftist congressman Thursday, the government news agency said. He was the highest-ranking official assassinated in the nine-year insurgency. <PERSON> Eriberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> was slain in <LOCATION> Chaclacayo </LOCATION>, a surburb on <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s outskirts, the <ORGANIZATION> Andina </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted police as saying The news agency blamed the Maoist guerrillas, but a member of <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Edmundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrugarra </PERSON>, blamed the anti-guerilla death squad, the <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The Franco Command surfaced a year ago, vowing to kill people it considers leftist guerrillas or their supporters. The government has denied opposition charges that the group is linked to the governing center-left <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> was a congressional deputy from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of Marxist parties and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s second strongest party in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He was the first legislator killed in the insurgency. <PERSON> Murrugarra </PERSON> said a gunman in a vehicle with three others opened fire as <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON> and his wife were dropping their three children off at school. The other members of <PERSON> Arroyo </PERSON>'s family were uninjured, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programas </ORGANIZATION> said. The Shining Path, which seeks to impose Marxist rule, has assassinated scores of politicians. Most have been from the Aprista party but officials from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and other parties also have been slain. None have been congressmen, however. In the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, a woman was killed and five people wounded when a column of pro-Cuban guerrillas raided a river town and held it for four hours, the <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comercio </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The respected <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> daily said at least 150 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tupac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> stormed <PERSON> Contamana </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Ucayali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 390 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, late Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it could not confirm the report. Ten defenders in the town's police post traded shots with the attackers for an hour before running out of ammunition and fleeing into the surrounding dense jungles, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Comercio </PERSON> said. The guerrillas robbed three banks and bombed several government offices before withdrawing, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Comercio </PERSON> said. The Tupac Amaru group, which endorses a Cuba-style Marxism, has been active since 1984. The group is not connected to the larger Shining Path. Also Thursday, miners across <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> began a three-day strike demanding that mine owners agree to negotiate all labor contracts jointly, the union said. It was not known how many of the nation's estimated 70,000 miners joined the walkout. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which called the strike, held two strikes over the same issue in the past year. Mining was paralyzed mining for three months and losses reached $ 400 million, one-third of the annual exports from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s most important industry. But the walkouts failed to force private mine owners to accept the federation demand that labor contracts of mine unions be negotiated jointly rather than on the current company-by-company basis.

 A West German whom <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities call `` the world's top techno-bandit'' was sentenced Thursday to 30 additional months in federal prison and a $ 40,100 fine in a daring, ill-fated helicopter escape attempt from a federal prison. <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON>, 49, was given 30-month concurrent sentences on both of two counts of conspiracy to escape, in addition to the 15-year term imposed on <LOCATION> Bruchhausen </LOCATION> for sales of classified technology to Soviet bloc countries. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> to exceed the sentencing guidelines for the attempted escape, discounting the defense contention that <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> was entrapped. Defense attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON> asked the judge to stay within the guidelines, which called for a maximum sentence of 30 months. He said no decision had been made on an appeal. Authorities foiled <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON>'s escape by setting up a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs helicopter as the escape aircraft. He had reportedly offered to pay up to $ 250,000 for assistance. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> was taken into custody by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and four prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that swooped down over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last August. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> began serving his 15-year sentence for sales of classified technology at the <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> prison in May 1987. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> and three others were indicted in August 1981 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal income tax laws. The 60-count indictment charged that from January 1977 through June 5, 1980, <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> and the others `` conspired to export from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> various high technology commodities'' to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere without export licenses from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Dubbed the `` techno-bandit'' by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, he was arrested May 8, 1985, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, extradited the following year and convicted of wire fraud in 1987. <PERSON> Bruchhausen </PERSON> allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy corporations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 Fourteen winning tickets were picked in the state's record $ 115 million lottery jackpot, a computer analysis showed Thursday, and two winners quickly were claimed by a group of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> factory workers and a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> family. The big jackpot was totaled at $ 115,578,980.14, about 30 minutes after 14 workers from a <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, brick factory arrived to claim a share of it, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON>, lottery executive director. People from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, also claimed to hold winning tickets, but did not arrive at lottery headquarters Thursday. `` I could n't believe it. I still do n't,'' said brick worker <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavers </PERSON>, 38, of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Also arriving to claim a winning ticket were <PERSON> Alverto </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>; her son, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, 39, of Summer <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, and her daughter, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she got six of the winning numbers from a computerized palm reader at an open-air bazaar when she and her husband were vacationing in mid-March in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` I did n't believe in them,'' <PERSON> Mrs </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said of the palm reader. `` I believe it was just luck.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> added the seventh number, 24, based on the number of tickets they had purchased. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> is a coal miner, Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is a library technician at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and Mrs. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> is a retired house keeper. Mrs. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said the winning ticket was the first one that she checked after the numbers were drawn Wednesday night. `` I went down the line, sinking my pencil in. Tears came to my eyes and I could n't even look at the tickets,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said lottery officials would not be able to confirm the winning tickets until a second computer analysis is completed. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said each of the 14 jackpot tickets will be worth $ 317,524.67 a year, or more than $ 8.2 million paid out over 26 years. The workers from the Harbison-Walker brick factory arrived at the lottery's headquarters in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, in a four-vehicle caravan, setting off a wild dash by reporters and photographers as lottery officials tried to herd the potential winners into the office by a back door. The workers said that they had bought $ 140 worth of tickets. Each of them contributed $ 10 to the pool. <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said that it may take until early next week to validate the ticket presented by the workers, in part because they do not have a signed, legal agreement among themselves on how their share of the prize will be distributed. In most cases, <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said, jackpot winners call the lottery first and are told of the necessity of having a lawyer draw up a dispersement agreement. In this case, he said, the workers did not call. `` They got excited ... and headed on down,'' <PERSON> Scroggins </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, said his niece, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Trapuzzano </PERSON>, 34, was heading to lottery headquarters with what she believes is a winning ticket from Wednesday's drawing. However, lottery officials said Thursday afternoon they had not heard from the woman. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> showed a reporter from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> a ticket that matched seven of the winning numbers drawn. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he owns the ticket with his parents, a brother and a sister. He said the family waited in line one hour too buy $ 80 worth of tickets. A week of millionaire fantasies ended Wednesday night with the drawing of the 11 Super 7 numbers. The numbers were 06-16-24-34-35-37-40-41-45-60-71. Smaller payouts for matching four, five or six numbers will be determined by Friday. Prizes for matching six numbers are usually several thousand dollars; for five they are usually several hundred dollars and the prize for matching four numbers is $ 7. Lottery security was tightened last year after a bogus jackpot ticket was presented to lottery officials and a check was issued. Further checks revealed the ticket was fake, prepared by a computer technician with access to the lottery system. Payment was stopped before the check was cashed and the technician and an accomplice who claimed the prize were prosecuted. Two lottery officials were reprimanded. `` The validation process is not a two-minute thing,'' <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> said. `` It's more like two days. There are extensive security provisions in place and they will all be followed.'' The long lines at the state's 3,400 on-line lottery outlets were generally quieter Thursday. `` It's like going from a New Year's Eve party to the morning after,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzocca </PERSON>, manager of a book and card shop in <LOCATION> Palmyra </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, saying he's `` offended'' by the treatment he received from a major Japanese auto parts company, served notice Thursday he will pursue his claim to management rights in the company. `` Frankly, I was offended'' by the `` brazen'' action of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to question his ownership of the largest single block _ 20.2 percent _ of its stock in refusing him three seats on its board of directors earlier this month, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> told reporters at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> foreign press center He also described it as `` frankly, insulting'' to him as the largest stockholder to have to read in the newspapers rather than being told personally that his stock ownership was being challenged. `` I not going to walk away from this issue, and neither, I believe, is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, describing talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government leaders and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The millionaire <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman said he is asking neither the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nor Japanese government `` to bail me out of anything I'm in. I can take care of myself.'' But the reaction is very strong in both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` something must be done as far as opening up'' Japanese financial markets to equality for foreign buyers, he added. `` I do n't think the Japanese are going to be able to sit back and continue to pick and choose in our country what they want to buy, what they want to invest in and want to own without having the same opportunities for Americans in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It's that simple.'' `` I do n't think you're going to be able to do much about the $ 55 billion trade deficit with the Japanese unless you do something to open up markets.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he reported on his experiences in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Japanese Ambassador <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> in addition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Legislation already has been suggested to establish reciprocity in financial markets, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, adding, `` I would n't want to see anything foolish'' proposed, and the best thing would be for the two countries to cooperate in opening markets. `` I see the Japanese pouring $ 15 billion into our country buying real estate and ranches, other ownership. They're treated just exactly like other stockholders in this country, but ... there's some reason we're not wanted in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Reports from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said a tenet of Japanese business culture is that enterprises belong basically to their employees rather than stockholders. `` I plan to attend the annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> June 29 and will continue to assert my rights as a shareholder, in fact, the largest one in the company,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. He said he purchased the 20.2 percent stock interest in <LOCATION> Koito </LOCATION> on March 16 with the knowledge of the Japanese finance ministry which cleared the purchase two weeks later. The company carried out the stock transfer and after that, `` It is not the management's business'' to question the intention or circumstances of purchase, he said. `` We do n't have specific plans to change management or accuse them of anything, other than I have reason to feel offended by the way they have treated their largest stockholder,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> continued. `` We said we were not hostile. We mean it. We said were longterm. We mean it. We said we want to work with management and expand markets. We mean it. `` I was told you do n't understand Japanese customs. ... I said maybe not customs, but I understand ownership, and we are your largest owner.''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge said his decision to release 4,200 Austrian-made rifles impounded as part of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration ban on imported assault weapons still leaves a bigger question far from settled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the rifles should be released to <ORGANIZATION> Gun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of nearby <LOCATION> Trussville </LOCATION> `` while the broader national debate continues to rage.'' His ruling came Wednesday in Gun South's lawsuit, apparently the first challenge of the administration's temporary ban on importation of semiautomatic rifles. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> criticized the ban, initiated by federal drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, as `` obviously the product of a ` hurry-up' skull session, if not a stampede reaction set off by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said the government must release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA rifles impounded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> airport, and allow another 3,000 to be sent to Gun South from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. His ruling does not directly affect the moratorium on additional import permits for 29 other kinds of assault rifles until the administration decides whether they are used for legitimate sporting purposes. But the judge criticized even that part of the policy, contending the administration overstepped its bounds and interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' right to enact laws. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the department was reviewing <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>'s decision and had yet to decide whether to appeal. An appeal could delay delivery of the guns, which sell from $ 900 to $ 1,000 each. `` I applaud the judge's decision,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, federal affairs director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> while attending an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. At an April 6 hearing before <PERSON> Acker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney described the ban on assault weapons as a life and death matter, but Gun South argued that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> approved import permits for the rifles before the ban was announced in late March. Gun South owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified that the ban could put him out of business. Semiautomatic weapons became an issue after reports of their use in drug-linked killings and in the slaying of five children and the wounding of 30 others in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> schoolyard in January. <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> said the government offered no evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Steyr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AUG-SA </ORGANIZATION> failed to meet the hunting qualification contained in the ban. `` To the contrary, all of the evidence in this case demonstrates that the Steyr AUG is designed and marketed to be predominantly a sporting weapon,'' the judge said. He said that the `` only thing that has changed is an administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and perhaps the perception of the proportion of the drug and gun crisis.''

<TEXT>
 The ninth victim of a serial killer apparently preying on prostitutes and drug users in the seaport of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> was identified Thursday as a 25-year-old New Bedford woman with two sons. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON> was reported missing by her family last August, and investigators said she probably was killed at that time. Her body was largely decomposed when highway workers discovered it Monday in the brush along Interstate 195 in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said both the circumstances of <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON>'s disappearance and the location of her body were similar to the other eight victims. All were women between the ages of 25 and 36 who lived in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> area and had ties to that city's <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a neighborhood known for prostitution and drug sales. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON> also `` had a history of drug use,'' but he declined to comment on whether she was a prostitute. <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON>'s family, meanwhile, struggled to tell her 4 - and 6-year-old sons what happened, said her brother, <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> `` We told them that their mother did n't run away,'' he said, crying. `` We told them basically just somebody took their mother and he was bad to her and hurt her and now their mother died and went to heaven.'' Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a forensic dentist at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, used dental records to identify the remains at his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> laboratory. All the victims found so far disappeared from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> between April and September of last year. The first body was discovered last July, and the rest have turned up periodically since. All have been found along highways within a radius of about 10 miles from the center of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON> was one of three missing women whose families had been awaiting word on identification of the body. <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said he has several suspects, and a grand jury has been hearing evidence in the case, but no one has been indicted.

<HEAD>Canada May Ask Allies To Help Defend It in Arctic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The defense minister indicated Thursday <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> may have to ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help defend its Arctic areas because a $ 6.7 billion plan to develop a nuclear-powered submarine fleet was left out of this year's budget. Asked how <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> could enforce its sovereignty claim over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said, `` I believe there's an opportunity through cooperation. We may have to rely more on allies. `` There are better was of defending northern sovereignty but unfortunately we can not afford those ways,'' <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a large fleet of nuclear-powered submarines that have sailed under the polar ice cap, provoking Canadian protests. Only nuclear-powered submarines can patrol the waters under the polar ice cap. Reactors powering the subs allow them to stay under water for long periods without having to surface. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rompkey </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it was incredible that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> might have to rely on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to defend Canadian territory. `` The whole point of the Conservative policy was to show the Americans that we are in there defending ourselves. Now they've done a 180-degree turn and said ` leave it to the Americans,''' he said Since 1987, when the plan to build the submarines was announced, Conservative ministers insisted the submarines were essential to assert sovereignty in the Arctic. Polls showed that 70 percent of Canadians were opposed to buying nuclear submarines. But <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said public opposition had nothing to do with the decision, which he said was purely economic. Peace activists, meanwhile, praised the decision to shelve the nuclear submarine project. `` It proves that organized, sustained public opposition can indeed make a difference,'' said <PERSON> Ish </PERSON> <PERSON> Theilheimer </PERSON>, head of the peace group Operation Dismantle, which gathered at its headquarters to celebrate. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, director of a think tank called the Canadian Center for <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION>, congratulated the government for scrapping the subs but said the decision should n't be viewed as a step toward unilateral disarmament. The British and French firms that vied to sell their submarine designs to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> issued terse statements expressing disappointment at the decision. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, editor of the authoritative defense publication <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships, said the decision was `` a disappointment to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and -RRB- all those who believe it is necessary to be able to contain the Soviet submarine threat.'' He said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s plan to buy either British Trafalgar or <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amethyste </LOCATION> submarines would have been `` a major contribution towards <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-submarine warfare capability.''

Approval is virtually assured. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> controls the assembly with 61 deputies to 35 deputies from six opposition parties. The move seems aimed at creating a more democratic image for the leftist government of this Central American country and comes as President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> tours <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> seeking more money for economically distressed <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Some of the 10 European countries on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s itinerary have said more aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> depends on government efforts toward democratization. Quant, a Nicaraguan citizen of Taiwanese extraction, was vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> when he was arrested in September 1986 on charges of spying for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. He was accused of being recruited in 1983 and then providing economic information to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. In a news conference at the time of his arrest, Quant admitted giving information to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, saying he did it `` out of curiosity.'' <PERSON> Baldizon </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested on charges of being a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy and of complicity in treason after his brother, Lt. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldizon </PERSON>, defected on July 1, 1985. He was sentenced on July 22, 1985, to 10 years in prison. A spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he was released from prison and placed under house arrest last March 17. Ms. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, then a government employee, was sentenced to nine years in prison on Jan. 9, 1985, on charges of belonging to the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan guerrillas, known as Contras. The spokeswoman said Ms. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> was allowed to leave prison in January and live with her family under house arrest. On the political front, the government and opposition party leaders have invited members of a private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group, the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, to act as observers during the Feb. 25, 1990, presidential election. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, president of the non-profit organization, told journalists in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> Wednesday his group will decide by this weekend if it will accept the invitation.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> releases 100 million tons of waste into the air and water each year, but is working to clean up its pollution, the leading Soviet environmental official said Thursday. `` Damage to our environment costs the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people at least 50 billion rubles -LRB- $ 80 billion -RRB- each year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON>, chairman of the Soviet Commission on the Environment. He refused to say, however, if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was willing to join Western countries in implementing a global ban on ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000. <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> said his commission was recently established to consolidate the job of nine previous commissions and seven ministries, some of which had vested interests in industry. Scientists and politicians were debating the question at meetings in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The head of the U.N. Environment Program said Wednesday that disagreement with the Soviets could block agreement to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, which are blamed for depleting the Earth's ozone layer. <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> for two days of talks with Swedish officials. He is to sign a Swedish-Soviet agreement on environmental issues Friday. His visit was timed to the third anniversary of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant explosion, which played havoc with reindeer herds in northern <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and sent fallout over much of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Chernobyl </PERSON> taught the Soviets not to decide major projects without open discussion. `` I would not want any other country to go through what we did,'' he added. In a talk at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> reported, `` Our country suffers a great deal from acid rain, and 100 cities, with more than 50 million inhabitants, are the worst affected. `` Environmental problems are extremely grave in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> and other southern parts of the country. `` From now on industries which let out more waste than allowed will have to pay fines, and these will be heavy,'' he said. He declined to give specifics. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently began cooperating with <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> on how to curb pollution on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, where acid rain from metals plants have caused acid rain and water pollution.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> celebrated strong U.S.-Australian relations Thursday and in particular praised <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for its military defense efforts. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on his second day in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, flew here from <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, where he told a press conference the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would like to see its friends in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> pick up more of the tab for defense at a time when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is restraining its military budget. But he praised <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for its efforts to enhance security. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has been a very very good partner in the alliance and has taken national security to its heart,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, he attended a black-tie dinner marking Australian-American Friendship Week, an annual event to honor the allies' joint effort in the Battle of the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in 1942. Noting that he was born in 1947, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I'm the first vice president to be born after World War II.'' But in the tradition of the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> battle, in which the allies repulsed the Japanese, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the two countries `` must continue a relationship that is dedicated to keeping peace in this region.'' He did mention one dispute between the two countries, over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidies to wheat growers in an export enhancement program that the Australians contend hurts their wheat sales in foreign markets. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he discussed the issue with Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` Believe me, I've heard about our trade policy and export enhancement program ... in no uncertain terms not only from the prime minister but others,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` It is still my belief that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy is not hurting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' he said. But <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arguments that subsidies had not hurt <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s wheat exports. `` The losses are not figments of the imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally hurtful statistics which have adversely affected our wheat farms,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made `` every effort'' to see that Australian markets are not hurt when third countries are involved in grain trade. The vice president said the subsidies are not designed to hurt <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Instead, his aides have said they are aimed at countering subsidies that the Europeans place on their grain. Despite its own subsidy program, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is dedicated to free trade. `` Our objective is to have free trade. ... Our objective is to knock down barriers.'' Meanwhile, the congressional delegate to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faleomavaega </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s two-hour trip to that territory Tuesday as `` a slap in the face'' to other island nations in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The Democratic delegate said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers are insensitive to the unique economic structures and other problems facing such nations as <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vanuatu </LOCATION>, none of which is affiliated with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It's time for different thinking in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' regarding the strategic region, he said, adding, `` I give credit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for their efforts to be friends with island countries.'' During his two-hour stop, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samoans </ORGANIZATION> `` happy campers,'' participated in a traditional ceremony and declared a public holiday. Before leaving <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited the Tidbinbilla Space Tracking Center, a joint operation between the Australians and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the American space agency. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, made a brief telephone call to astronaut <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to discuss preparations for the space shuttle launch, scheduled for Friday. `` We hope and pray everything goes well,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bolden </PERSON>. The shuttle will carry in its payload a satellite to study <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The staff at the Australian facility will track that satellite.

 Several came from broken homes and all lived in a neighborhood surrounded by drugs and crime, but the youths accused of a savage gang rape of a Central Park jogger were unlikely attackers, by some accounts. `` I deal with kids in trouble. These were not kids in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>, principal of the junior high school two of the accused boys attended. `` They come from homes of parents who care, parents who are as shocked as we are.'' The victim, a 28-year-old investment banker, remained in a coma in critical condition Thursday and was on a respirator after developing pneumonia. Eight of her alleged attackers, ages 14 to 17, are in custody. Two were indicted Wednesday, and on Thursday a grand jury indicted three more teen-agers who allegedly left her for dead. A fourth teen-ager was released without bail after a prosecutor told the judge the grand jury had taken no action in his case. When asked afterward by reporters if his client had made a deal to testify or agreed to a plea bargain, the teen's defense attorney said no. Two other teen-agers were indicted Thursday on charges involving an earlier attack by the same group on a male jogger, who eluded his assailants and reported the assault to park police. The female victim was jogging alone in the northern end of the park later on the night of April 19 when she was attacked by a gang, beaten unconscious with a pipe and heavy rock, raped and left bound and naked on the ground. When she was found four hours later, her body temperature had fallen to 85 degrees and much of her brain activity had stopped. Doctors at <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> say she may survive, but it's unlikely she will ever recover completely because of the injuries to her brain A CAT scan will be done Friday to find out if the woman's brain swelling has gone down, doctors said Thursday. `` By the end of the weekend, we might have a clearer idea of whether the damage is substantial,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, assistant chief of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He said of patients injured this badly: `` However ` stable' we call them, their life hangs by a thread.'' Police said only one of the suspects _ 17-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> _ had a police record. But friends said he was a frequent churchgoer who played drums for the choir. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a 15-year-old schoolmate of suspect <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>, 15, said: `` He's a good kid, he just followed the wrong crowd. If you're in the wrong crowd, this could happen to anybody. You have to make your own decisions, that's all.'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> of the national board of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychologists </ORGANIZATION> said the violence of city life allowed the boys to bury normal emotions in the frenzy of their attack. `` They're human beings who went berserk,'' she said. `` They had fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on television, the ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in control, macho, aggressive, strong.'' The suspects were being held on charges of attempted murder, rape and assault and could face other charges. The woman apparently was one of several targets of the gang going `` wilding'' that night. The term was new to police but not the activity: For years, loosely organized packs of marauding youths have roamed the streets and parks bullying, robbing and attacking victims at random. The assailants reportedly used racial epithets in one of eight assaults during the rampage and discussed `` getting whitey'' or `` getting a white jogger.'' The victim is white and the accused attackers are black. However, law-enforcement experts say victims of the so-called `` wolf packs'' are more often black than white. After their arrests, <PERSON> Brisco </PERSON> and Kharey Wise, 16, were roughed up in an attack by several other inmates and <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaam </PERSON>, 15, was attacked by another youth at the <ORGANIZATION> Spofford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Questions about the assault reached <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when a group of freshmen Republican congressmen said Thursday the incident pointed up the need for a tougher juvenile justice system. `` What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime, you're going to do big-boy time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice. He and fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Crime said that from age 14 on, youths who commit violent crimes such as rape, armed robbery, murder or attempted murder should be punished as adults. Central Park has a reputation _ largely undeserved, police and city officials say _ of being a dangerous place. `` If this had happened in the streets, it would n't be anything like this,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Haws </PERSON>, who takes tourists on carriage rides through the park.

 Hearings into the wreck of the Exxon Valdez next month will examine alcohol abuse, timeliness of emergency responses and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> staffing, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The agency is to hold fact-finding sessions May 16-19 to determine how the tanker ran aground May 24, spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil, and how to prevent a recurrence, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>. Twenty witnesses are expected, although Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, skipper of the Exxon Valdez, probably wo n't be one of them, <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> faces three misdemanor charges, including operating the tanker while under the influence of alcohol. `` The hearing will be the same as the ones that come after a plane crash,'' <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. `` Our purpose is not to assess blame, but to have an open hearing and gather facts.'' Other issues to be explored include fatigue, human factors, adequacy of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s drug and alcohol regulations and the role of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s `` vessel traffic service,'' which guides vessels through shipping channels in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Brazil's President Announces Emergency Measure To Restrict Strikes</HEAD>

strikes. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> announced on Thursday night an emergency measure restricting the right to strike and imposing other curbs, saying `` savage waves of strikes'' threaten to undermine democracy in financially distressed <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. ` I do not condemn legitimate strikes guaranteed by the constitution,'' he said over national TV. `` But I can not tolerate the action of hoodlums who through violence occupy factories, or armed demonstrators who throw bombs.'' During his 10-minute address, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> attacked `` political groups who do not accept the democratic game'' for what he called illegal strikes that paralyzed key economic sectors. Much of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s economic woes stem from inflation. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said his provisional measure _ the equivalent of a presidential decree _ goes into effect immediately and will force unions to maintain a emergency work force in essential sectors such as electricity, communications, hospitals, transportation, water, fuel distribution, ports and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Workers in basic industries and services will have to give 48-hour advance notice before walking out, he said. As a third limitation, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> said strikes now must be approved by one-third of the total union membership. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first civilian president after 21 years of military rule, said the government will release more details Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has 30 days to approve or reject his action. If it approves, the provisional measure becomes law. The president spoke as ports nationwide were idled for a second day, union officials said, by a strike of 80,000 dock workers for higher pay. `` No ships are being loaded or unloaded at any port in the country,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a union official at the port of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s second-largest. The strike does not affect oil shipments because the state oil monopoly, <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION>, has its own loading terminals and separately unionized employees. Workers want a standardized pay scale and a pay increase of 180 percent to cope with inflation. The right to strike for both public and private workers is guaranteed under <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s new constitution, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last October. But <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> cautioned Thursday night, `` When one goes beyond the limits of the law, the road to force is opened.'' He said 8,790 strikes had been called during his four years in office, including 1,288 so far this year. He said 70 percent were in the public sector. `` I never imagined that among other attempts to undermine democracy there would be savage waves of strikes,'' said <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who took office in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s top generals. Failure of the <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> government to curb 1,000-percent-a-year inflation has led to strikes that hit ports, banks, the auto industry and schools. In January, the government announced its fourth anti-inflation program in three years to control wages and prices, cut government spending and eliminate up to 90,000 civil service jobs. Inflation fell from 28.8 percent a month in December to 3 percent for 11 days in February, but bounced back to 6 percent in March and was expected to wind up at 7 percent for April. The government authorized pay increases of up to 18 percent in April, unfroze some prices and created a system for 90-day cost-of-living adjustments. But labor groups estimated that workers' buying power fell 49 percent in the last year and threaten to call another general strike unless 50 percent pay raises are offered. Leftist labor unions organized a two-day national strike to protest the wage freeze. The strike was only partially successful, but strikes spread in April among teachers, bank workers, longshoremen and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION> police.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought to the White House a Cabinet steeped in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience, but it is one of his outsiders, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who has taken the most visible role 100 days into his administration. The transportation secretary has taken charge in major aviation and automobile issues. But he's also emerged as the administration's point man in areas that stray into the territory of others in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet: the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill, the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, and fighting drugs and terrorism, to name a few. `` He's shown good instincts,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank. But <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> questions how much `` staying power'' the former federal prosecutor and head of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass transit system will have. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also came into office with a pledge to hit the ground running, yet many of his department secretaries have moved slowly in their new jobs. `` All of them are somewhat limited by the defining characteristic of 1989 _ there ai n't no money,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal think tank. That financial reality of big deficits limits the initiatives available to any of the administration's domestic Cabinet secretaries. But even <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s senior-most Cabinet member, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose appointment was announced the day after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election, has moved slowly in building a team and taking foreign-policy initatives. Many of the departments are still without confirmed appointees in top-level jobs, with 49 nominations pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and more still to be made. Some of the independent agencies are hampered too: the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has no chairman, and the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> does n't have enough members for a quorum. Here is a brief look at the Cabinet: _ State <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is an old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend who ran his presidential campaign and is a veteran of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He has concentrated on improving <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ties but also started negotiations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and worked out a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to permit non-lethal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, at least until the fall. So tightly have <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and his closest aides held control that experienced diplomats have grumbled that they were being ignored. _ Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has taken charge forcefully at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and helped the administration put behind the debacle of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s defeated nomination. In a month on the job, he has faced a budget agreement requring him to find $ 10 billion worth of cuts in next year's budget. He has moved to cut spending for the `` Star Wars'' nuclear defense, ship building, troop strength, and the new stealth bomber, and he has put together a combined MX and Midgetman missile program. _ Transportation When the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> walked out on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to speak for the administration. He rejected union appeals for the government to step in, and while the strike drags on, it has brought no major disruption in air traffic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, whose department includes the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, oversee the cleanup of oil spilled by the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> also has pushed for tougher auto mileage standards. _ Labor <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> slipped into the background in the Eastern strike, although it was threatening to spread and she had the double qualification of being a former transportation secretary. Still, she has led administration efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit a minimum wage increase and for its tax-credit child care proposal. _ Health and Human Services <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has kept a low profile after a bruising confirmation, when he was attacked by abortion foes for remarks supporting a women's right to an abortion. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> apologized and said he had misspoken. Since then, the White House has nominated assistants that are known for anti-abortion views. _ Justice <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdover, is a moderate former governor who has moved rightward as attorney general, becoming the administration's advocate for drug testing and overturning the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling that permits abortion. _ Treasury <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, another of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdovers, has won plaudits for tackling two of the toughest economic issues, how to rescue the savings and loan industry and what to do about the Third World debt crisis. But he's come in for criticism, in part because of public miscues as the administration's chief economic spokesman, giving what seemed to be indifferent responses regarding problems of the deficit and inflation. _ Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil millionaire and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend, fought to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology in the FSX fighter deal. But he has not yet been elevated to the front-ranks of economic decision-making. _ Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has drawn praise from all sides for bringing attention to homelessness and other urban ills, and has attacked drugs in public housing by moving to ease evictions. He also won administration backing for tax credits for urban enterprise zones. But urban advocates are waiting to see money to go with his `` conservative war on poverty.'' The question for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is: Can he meet the expectations he has raised? _ Interior <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> was frozen out of initial decisions on the oil spill, while <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> dominated. He's made public misstatements and been criticized as uninformed by environmentalists. _ Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> has been more conciliatory and less visible than his controversial predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. But he has offered only a modest package of education initatives, proposing spending that does not even keep up with inflation, despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge to be `` the education president.'' At the other posts, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has yet to take a major initiative at Energy, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has attacked foreign agriculture subsidies but also has been late in hiring his team. At Veterans Affairs, the newest department, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has been praised by veterans' advocates for openness and for winning approval from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a small supplemental appropriation this year. Office of Management and Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has Cabinet-level status, as does Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. She has talked tough on the trade deficit but taken few real steps, while <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was chief architect of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While it has been ridiculed as only papering over the problem, it has allowed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep his no-tax-increase pledge. Drug policy chief <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, while pointedly not given Cabinet status, has drawn attention as if he had it, raising gun control as an issue and winning at least a temporary ban on the importation of semiautomatic weapons.

<HEAD>From Repression to Promiscuity: The Tribulations of a British Actress</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ``Getting It Right'' Opens May 5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In `` A Room With a View,'' <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonham </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> plays a young heiress struggling against the repressive atmosphere of turn-of-the-century <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The actress felt equally confined. `` <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had the funny lines, but I was on screen all the time,'' she said. `` I was the stooge in a way. I wish I could have had the funny lines. I felt deprived.'' Tired of portraying `` ever so nice, often corseted girls,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> begged for a chance to play <PERSON> Minerva </PERSON>, the promiscuous daughter of Sir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Munday </PERSON> in `` Getting It Right,'' an English comedy. `` They sent me a script because I have some sort of name,'' she said. But <PERSON> Randal </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kleiser </PERSON>, the director -RRB- was somewhat doubtful I was right for the part and thought I would n't be able to do it.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s persistence won out, however, and not only did the actress have fun with the character, but the role of her father was filled at the last moment by Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>. `` I bumped into him the first day and he said, ` I've heard so much about you. Congratulations. And I said, ` Congratulations on your career.''' She remembered the great Shakespearean actor as being `` very, very shy and terribly modest. There was great reverence on the set. He would cringe with extra shyness because of everybody's sheer reverence. He was very professional. He was also very nervous and I was touched.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has become accustomed to working with experienced actors. Her film debut came in 1985 as the title character in `` Lady <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>,'' in which she played opposite several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. `` A Room With a View'' had a high-powered cast, including <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Denholm </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>. Besides Geilgud, `` Getting It Right'' features the veteran <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> actors <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` Stars do n't exist as such in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` They are more actors who are revered. There's much less said about their sex lives. I think it has to do with the fact that there's not so much money involved.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had a chance to witness fame, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> style, when she was a guest star in an episode of `` Miami Vice.'' `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> could n't walk the streets. I thought, if this is what the star system does, I prefer not to know about it. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> is very famous and he can go out and not get recognized.'' She talked of her fondness for doing things `` out of context,'' such as following a period piece such as `` A Room With a View'' with a contemporary comedy. Even her decision to become an actress originated from a liking for the unexpected. `` I was intensely shy as a child. It was the last thing I expected to do, stand up in front of an audience, which is why I did it. It's extending yourself and exposing yourself to the extreme,'' she said. `` Actors are considered egotists, but on the whole it's generosity; you're giving of yourself. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did not see acting as a full-time profession, even when she was chosen by director <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> to play the teen-age queen who was beheaded after nine days in `` Lady <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>.'' `` He said, ` Get that girl, she does look quite arresting.' He told me to learn the part in 48 hours. I learned a speech from ` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>' and I had about one month of auditions and screen tests. `` I was about to go to <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and my life went into a completely different tangent. It took me three years to realize that it's not a tangent, that it's all connected.'' The day after completing `` Lady <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was contacted by director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON>, who along with producer <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Merchant </PERSON> was putting together the cast for `` A Room With a View.'' She felt relaxed in the interview with Ivory, still taking a casual approach to acting, but tensed up once filming began. `` I hated it,'' she said. `` I was learning. It was a case of being asked to sprint before I could crawl. I did n't give myself the license to fail. I owe it very much to the people around me. I did n't realize that I should let myself learn and make mistakes. I was doing too much.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has gained an appreciation for the subtlety needed in film acting. `` In the end you have to find one threadline. It's seeing the essence of things. It might be just a walk, or a bit of music and you think, ` That's the person.' It's the most economical way of revealing. Acting is about doing and the less you think it about the better.''

 It is sometimes said that the stock market is slave to two masters: interest rates and earnings. But if that's so, you ca n't tell it from today's market Stocks react inversely to interest rates, according to the saying. But today's interest rates are higher than they used to be and so are stock prices. Should n't they be lower? And, according to the saying, stocks anticipate earnings increases by rising months before the fact. But stocks are up these days, and anticipated earnings are n't what they used to be. Is the market overpriced? Fundamental thinkers, such as <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s Magellan Fund, believe you ca n't foretell interest rates or the economy, and that the only sensible thing to do is to buy into sound companies and hope for the best. Throw out all the theories you read and hear about, say these basic thinkers, because eventually the market will throw them out anyway. It may be happening now, they say. Nevertheless, a very large percentage of the literature disseminated by brokerage houses is loaded with theories, charts, graphs, analyses and forecasts of where interest rates and the economy are headed. It's the meat and potatoes of market analysis, even if at the moment the practicioners are getting sick on their own diet. One market analyst states that while a widely anticipated economic slowdown would have negative implications for corporate earnings, `` Today's stock market investors have yet to make this connection.'' Eventually, he says, they might. But what about interest rates? If there is a slowdown, then interest rates probably would fall. Would the market then rise on the assumption that lower rates are good for stocks, or would it fall in response to lower earnings? The current situation is an oddity, one of the reasons being that a weaker economy is widely viewed as good. Ordinarily, a weaker economy is viewed negatively because it cuts into profits and throws people out of work. Today's economy, however, is believed to be close to capacity, which is a dangerous thing. Without sufficient slack, upward pressure on wages, prices and interest rates is created. A bit more slack, some believe, is called for. The theory that the market is enslaved to rates and earnings, therefore, is suspended for the time being. Undeterred, those who subscribe to it believe the theory will reassert itself before summer and fall in reaction to lessened expectations for corporate profits. One of them, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, observes that prices may be ignoring the evidence that is beginning to unfold _ that while corporate profits might still achieve records this year, the rate of increase is decelerating. Most published forecasts of corporate profits for 1990, it says, are mere extrapolations of 1989. This it believes is unrealistic. Why, says <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, there may be a recession in 1990, and `` if this occurs, we estimate that profits will fall roughly 20 percent next year.'' Will profits fall? Will investors make the connection? Will the market roam free? Or will it become enslaved by that other part of the saying _ that lower interest rates are good for stocks? What the market really seems to be saying is that it is slave to nothing but the hopes and expectations of investors. If you feed the market more money, then prices will rise, and if you take money away, it will shrivel. Now that's a maxim you can believe in.

<DATELINE>BASCO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The jail in this windswept provincial capital is empty, except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell and potted plants in the other. `` There are crimes here, but only small crimes,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Clementi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, chief of the two-man police force in <LOCATION> Basco </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, the forgotten province of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. This year, Sgt. <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> has investigated three `` crimes'' _ domestic disputes and fights between neighbors. None was serious enough for the courts. Only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year. The most serious, a murder committed by a soldier, was the first killing reported in 20 years. `` We've had judges come to hear cases and they say it's like a vacation in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>, executive secretary to the mayor. The low crime rate is one of many features that make <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, the smallest, most northerly and least developed province, unique in the violence-plagued <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Its 15,000 people, known as Ivatans, live in quiet isolation. They fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250 miles -RRB- north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and only 140 miles south of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Few outsiders venture to <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, whose lush green fields, mist-shrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more like the Welsh coast than the tropics. Telephones? Forget it. The radio-telephone link was cut last year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, the main Philippine island. <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> is not perfect. It has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Per capita income is only 416 pesos -LRB- $ 19.80 -RRB- a month, so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in search of opportunity. `` We need government investments in cattle, fishing, garlic and root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find jobs here,'' said the provincial governor, <PERSON> Telesforo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>. `` Most provinces have an overpopulation, problem but our growth has been almost nill because of emigration.'' Typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and <PERSON> Ivatans </PERSON> live in square, fortress-like stone houses for protection from them, but there are no communist rebels, no armed gangs and no beggars. Internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in <LOCATION> Basco </LOCATION>, a town of 6,000 people. All <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> has only 120 motor vehicles and two-thirds are motorcycles. If roosters crowing can be called noise pollution, it is the most common form. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Poblete </PERSON>, provincial military commander, said `` I do n't feel very busy here.'' His major challenge is the occasional Taiwanese fishing vessel encroaching on Philippine waters. Otherwise, he said, `` All we do is run, train and have meetings. I do n't have much to do.'' `` I think it's the perpetual serenity which we do n't find in the metropolitan areas that keeps people here,'' said <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>, an in-law of the governor and native of <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> who returned with her husband after several years in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, I spent the whole day taking my children to and from school and driving to stores. Here, I kiss them in the morning and they come home in the afternoon. I can walk everywhere.'' Because of frequent storms in the Balintang Channel, commercial ships do not run regular services between <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, 140 miles to the south. Most supplies come on LST landing craft, which the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> navy uses extensively for inter-island traffic. They reach <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> about every three months. One ran aground in the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there, quietly rusting. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> provides the main link with the world, a daily flight often canceled because of bad weather. A siren heralds the plane's arrival and scores of townspeople usually go to meet it, since the airport is within walking distance of downtown Basco. There is no television and residents can pick up Philippine state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from <LOCATION> Tuguegarao </LOCATION>, 200 miles south. That hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in Basco can receive the part-time electricity. When the juice comes on for four hours each evening, residents flock to makeshift theaters where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos -LRB- 25 cents -RRB- a head. Those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity goes off. `` Fishing, swimming, biking, that's about all the recreation here,'' said <PERSON> Aniano </PERSON> <PERSON> Bata </PERSON>, 45, a lifelong resident. `` It's good, clean fun.''

 When Rogaine was unveiled last September by the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as the first scientifically proven hair-loss remedy, financial analysts envisioned desperate balding men running to doctors for prescriptions. Today, those analysts and many consumers are disappointed, and <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> is preparing a new, more aggressive marketing campaign aimed at men whose embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss may have prevented them from trying the drug. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> says it is pleased with Rogaine's performance and blames drug-industry analysts _ some of whom predicted 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales would top $ 300 million _ for unrealistic expectations. `` Any new product that saw the sales that Rogaine did in the first few months would be deemed an outstanding success,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` We expected to succeed in the long run, while the analysts thought it would be a runaway success.'' Disappointed consumers also may have set unrealistic expectations by ignoring <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s warnings that Rogaine would n't work for most men Though Upjohn does not release sales figures for specific products, drug industry analyst <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> estimated domestic sales for Rogaine accounted for $ 11 million of the Kalamazoo-based company's $ 755 million in net sales for the first three months of 1989. While Rogaine's sales were more than double those for the fourth quarter of 1988, <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said he interpreted the figures as disappointing. `` The product has certainly been slow out of the starting gate,'' he said. There are many reasons for Rogaine's sluggish sales, researchers and hair-loss specialists say. Among them: _ <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s 8-month-old, $ 20 million advertising campaign, featuring a man walking along a beach with the `` see your doctor'' phrase, may have been too low-key and vague _ The price, about $ 50 for a one-month supply and the necessary lifelong commitment to its use Once you stop using Rogaine, any hair you may have grown back will fall out. If the drug has stopped your hair loss, you'll make up for lost time as soon as you quit. Most baffling, however, is that companies featuring bogus baldness remedies on late-night television continue to outsell Rogaine by a ratio of about 10-to-1, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The biggest deterrent to <LOCATION> Rogaine </LOCATION> is that the man has to go to his doctor and admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss. With the others, he can call a 1-800 number from the privacy of his own home,'' said <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, whose non-profit organization provides consumer information on hair-loss treatments. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s new marketing campaign, beginning in mid-May, will feature a toll-free number. The consumer will be connected with a hair-care specialist to discuss Rogaine and then will receive information on Rogaine via mail. Like the previous ads, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> still wo n't refer to the drug by name. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> regulations prohibit companies from advertising prescription drugs by name unless there also is a full disclosure of any warnings and potential side effects. The company has released few details about its new marketing strategy, but says it's designed to identify and target the market for the drug, which was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> last August. Though analysts see the new campaign as <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s reaction to slow sales, the company insists the more aggressive campaign always was part of its marketing strategy. Some of the blame for disappointment with <ORGANIZATION> Rogaine </ORGANIZATION>'s results also lies with the consumer, who may have been expecting too much. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> warned consumers from the start that the tonic would n't work at all for most men. Rogaine, the trade name for a substance called minoxidil, is recommended for men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for 10 years or less and who have an area of baldness 4 inches in diameter or less on the crown of the head. Clinical trials showed about 39 percent of men suffering from male-pattern baldness will either grow some new hair back or stop losing hair after six to eight months on the drug. `` If you're going to use this stuff, you've got to be patient and use it for a year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiting </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Otherwise, you'll never know if it would have worked.'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Camp </PERSON>, a railroad engineer in <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, saw results after about three months on Rogaine. `` Since I started using it, I've definitely seen some new hair growing,'' said Camp, 46. `` And for 10 years, I've been using everything that I could get my hands on to stop hair loss.'' Still, <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rogaine </PERSON> was `` too expensive, especially since I'm going to have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years.'' At the 2,270-store Rite Aid pharmacy chain in <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said Rogaine sales had been slower than expected. Rogaine may almost double its market if the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approves it for use by women. Of the 50 million Americans losing their hair, 20 million are women, and clinical trials have found the drug to be slightly more effective on women, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> also is working on advanced application methods for the alcohol-based solution, which tends to be messy to apply, as well as teaming up with <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on new ingredients designed to increase efficacy and create new minoxidil products, such as a cream.

<HEAD>Bush and Congress: Still On a Honeymoon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, charting a new course for relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is taking lawmakers on a 100-day honeymoon of classic proportions, and usually feisty Democrats are declaring themselves delighted. `` What <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is trying to do is restore the trust that needs to exist between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House in order to get things done,'' says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., a fierce partisan when he wants to be but mellow toward the president these days House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., says that ` ` after what was clearly from our perspective a very harsh and negative campaign, I think the president immediately offered an approach of cooperation and conciliation ...'' `` I think he's doing very well,'' says In his first 100 days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not only erased most if not all of the bitterness among lawmakers resulting from the campaign but administered salve to a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shell-shocked after eight years of combat with <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a hard political beating in the early going as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for secretary of defense. Lawmakers say the problem was primarily friction between Tower and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Texas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a swift recovery and won quick confirmation for his second nominee for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> post, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. But he's headed for another showdown with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the minimum wage. And not all Democrats are buying off on the political nostalgia trip back to the era of good feeling when presidents almost always had a 100-day honeymoon with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. There is no certainty that the mood will last, says <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` It's too soon to tell. All the same, `` He's not an arm twister,'' says <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. `` He reasons.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compromised with lawmakers on the major issues of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the budget. `` I think the work we've done these past three months demonstrates the value of tough, principled negotiation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on April 24. The new president, who was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> from 1967-1970, also has gone to work on congressional egos. Earlier this month, he summoned a bipartisan group of lawmakers to the Cabinet Room for an open-ended session also attended by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. `` The president said, ` I promised consultation and we're going to consult,''' says Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill. `` The president said, ` I am concerned about the erosion of presidential authority and I realize that if presidential authority is to be reinforced, there must be consultation ...''' Skeptics hold that the new climate has been simple enough to engineer, given the lack of hard choices thus far The budget compromise envisions meeting the $ 100 billion deficit ceiling for fiscal 1990 prescribed by the Gramm-Rudman law but relies on projections, such as $ 5.4 billion in new revenue, that have fiscal experts squinting doubtfully. Many conservatives signed off on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s compromise plan to send $ 90 million more in non-lethal aid to Contra rebels opposed to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. Resigned to a firm anti-Contra majority on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, they say it was the best the president could have hoped for. But they still smoulder quietly at a provision that will allow congressional leaders to short-circuit the aid next fall if they are dissatisfied with the situation. The one issue where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appear to be on a head-on collision course is the minimum wage. The president is threatening to a veto of an increase approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Indeed, the White House almost seemed to seize on the conflict as proof that old-fashioned, head-butting politics are not extinct in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know what he's building up all this good will for,'' chortles Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` When substance comes up, people are n't going to go into the tank for you, just because you're a nice guy.'' Conservatives wonder if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might not be just a little too affable for his own good. `` It's conceivable that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> starts out with this modest beginning and then really goes to town,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, a fellow of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's not the normal pattern of presidencies.'' `` Politics,'' says <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, `` is about many things _ negotiation, necessary compromises, governing _ but at its bottom line, politics is about confrontation and disagreement ... Where is that agenda forcing confrontational votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? It's not there.'' More pragmatic Republicans scoff at that notion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, they note, was not swept in amid clarion calls for a sweeping overhaul of the system. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not come in what that same mandate'' that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had, reflects former White House Communications Director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON>. `` This is not a time of confrontation. We're now trying to improve what is already there.'' `` What is legislation except compromise?'' says <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Korologos </PERSON>, a former chief of <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> congressional relations. He sees the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> style as the normal product of the president's career as a professional insider adept in his knowledge of the ropes and levers of government. Even a few Democrats, however, wonder if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may not be missing an opportunity to whisk through a few favorite programs before the honeymoon ends. `` If there was anything on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda, this was the time to do it,'' says political consultant <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneiders </PERSON>, a former adviser to the Carter White House. He sees a fat and happy <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that cares little about Capitol Hill conflicts. `` They're not looking for a lot of activism and his style tends to fit in with the public mood.'' `` It's not absolutely necessary,'' says <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, one of the inner circle in <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` to make a big show of muscle and chutzpah and macho. He just has to show that he's not weak.'' That represents a change in American politics that <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> traces in part to `` the decline and virtual disappearance of tension and potential conflict between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. There's nothing to have a crisis about, and so <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convenes and goes about its business ... Where's his vision? Where's his plan? He does n't have to have one.'' `` None of this will hurt much as long as the conditions that elected him continue to prevail,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` ... The country does n't much care whether he has an agenda or whether he has a philosophy or whether he's a toady or whether he tries to stand up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Almost everyone agrees that a hard political rain would be guaranteed to fall if there were a recession. For the moment, though, the sun is shining and both sides instead are reveling in the fellowship. `` All I know,'' says Republican <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, glancing across the aisle to the Democratic side, `` is that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the hated enemy, the usurper, he did n't belong there. The attitude toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that he belongs there. That he elevates the debate and the level of discourse considerably.''

 Probably few Americans believe <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are likely to invade sparsely populated areas of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> when children of long-time farm families decide to head for the bright lights of the big cities. But two <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts say this fear is part of a `` territorial imperative'' that is a reason for some European countries viewing the migration of people from farming areas as a threat to national existence. As a result, they say, these countries spend lots of money and take extraordinary steps to keep people on the farms as long as possible. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have a number of common goals as they seek government policies that will enhance rural development. `` In spite of agriculture's shrinking share of employment and a corresponding decrease in its share of -LRB- total economic output -RRB-, agricultural policy is as difficult to disentangle from rural development policy in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as it is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> said. `` Agricultural and rural well-being are as closely identified in the popular mind and political processes of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as they are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Therefore, he said, governments continue to spend huge amounts of money on farm programs `` because they are uncertain about other intervention strategies to hold population'' in rural areas. `` However, in spite of their popular appeal, farm programs do little to accomplish that goal,'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON>, an economist, and <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a political scientist, said in the May issue of Farmline magazine that Americans might recognize the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as similar to their own. `` Here, despite record-high government ayments to farmers and record-high farm income in the middle 1980s, farm-dependent rural communities continue to lose population to metropolitan areas at or near record rates,'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> said. But the reasons behind the heavy spending on farm programs vary tremendously between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, for example. <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> described territorial imperative as the commitment to a form of economic development that allows people to continue to live in the countryside, if they choose, and still maintain a living standard at least close to the national average. `` The territorial imperative takes forms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that are unfamiliar to Americans,'' he said. `` Europeans are concerned with the ecological consequences of depopulation, what they call desertification. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been more densely settled than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for over a thousand years, and in this European view, much of the territory must be maintained by man in order to protect the ecology, the natural and social environments, and the beauty of the countryside.'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> added: `` Territorial concerns manifest themselves in some European countries, especially in the less-populated north, as important to national defense _ the need to have people in remote areas to assure that a potential enemy does not encroach unobserved on the borders.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said, `` territorial imperative is less tied to the maintenance of the countryside and more to the economic viability of rural communities, and the plight of those who must move to make a living.'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> said that when people move from rural areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> those left behind see it as a threat to their way of life. `` Parents are distressed by the prospect of separation from their children and granchildren, and elected officials see their constituencies and electoral bases eroding,'' he said. Politicians have deplored the loss of people from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rural areas, but `` legislation creating rural development programs has rarely corresponded to the rhetoric,'' he said. `` There are no programs specifically helping only places experiencing out-migration.'' For example, he said, laws creating the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not specifically direct its assistance at such areas. `` Nor did the laws creating any of the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rural development programs,'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> added. `` Our basic agricultural policies have supported the mechanization and consolidation of farming, facilitating the rapid loss of farm population and the decline of many farming communities.'' Between 1950 and 1985, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm population declined by an estimated 17.7 million people. `` Nevertheless, until the emergence of serious urban stresses in the 1960s, especially the riots of that decade, there was surprisingly little talk about out-migration or rural depopulation as a major problem,'' <PERSON> Deavers </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, meanwhile, leaders have matched the rhetoric and have added new programs that are designed to keep the rural population in place. Long, the political scientist, that if anything, western European leaders and governments `` are even more articulate about the territorial imperative.'' For example, he said, the 21-nation Council of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> recently conducted a `` campaign for the countryside,'' which included a focus on `` disadvantaged rural areas threatened by depopulation, economic decline and a diminishing quality of life.'' Rural problems sometimes permeate European politics, reflecting agriculture's `` comparatively great'' political muscle, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. One reason for such strength is a version of syndicalism practiced in in many European countries which gives quasi-official status to various organizations of tradesmen, producers and craftsmen. In the case of agriculture, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, one farmers' organization in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, for example, is designated as the official representative for all farmers in that country. The practice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is for each farm and commodity organization to speak for itself, although various coalitions have been formed from time to time as issues develop.

<TEXT>
 One hundred days later, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing just about what he said he was going to do _ changing things slowly, operating methodically, nothing drastic, little drama. That is the approach he described before the inauguration and the one he defends now. `` I'm a practical man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the other day. `` I like what's real. I'm not much for the airy and the abstract. And I like what works.'' Whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> method is working or not depends on who is judging. Early on, the president found it necessary to deny that his administration was drifting without clear purpose, beset by malaise _ the dread political affliction diagnosed during <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s one-term presidency. There remain suggestions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has described no clear purpose and that his own identity remains indistinct, ill-defined. That does n't seem to be bothering most Americans. The public opinion polls show solid approval ratings for the way he is doing his job. A <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated that 56 percent would rather have him as president than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> came to office with a clear mission and agenda _ rein in government and cut taxes. Those goals overrode everything else during his first months in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no such program, and said so before he took office. `` You're looking for a dramatic two-point program or something,'' he told an interviewer asking about his agenda for the first 100 days. `` We do n't need a two-point program. `` We need to correct one big problem and we need to build on some tremendous successes, and we need to capitalize on changes in the world.'' The problem was the budget deficit. It's still the problem, despite a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> deal with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to produce a holding-action budget this year. `` That's at least the approach I'm going to bring to the job,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in January. And now: `` I do not feel compelled or pressed because of a column here or a column there to reach out for something dramatic.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers did feel the need for a campaign-paced, six-state swing this week to say and show that a lack of drama does not mean a lack of action. `` My starting point has been a respect for American institutions _ for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for the dedicated civil servants of the executive branch, for state and local governments, for the concept of public service,'' the president told annual luncheon of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Monday. `` ... The emphasis is on cooperation, not confrontation, as the surest route to progress.'' This has meant compromise on some points on which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would n't budge. But that fits the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> premise that federal government can and should help solve problems. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> maintained that government usually was the problem, not the cure. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said before taking office that the voters did n't elect him to bring drastic change to government. `` That's not what I am about,'' he said. `` People understood that when they were voting. They were n't looking for a radical shift.'' There have been shifts, but most have come gradually, on selected issues, not as part of any grand design. That leads back to the question of whether there is a grand design for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency. None shows yet, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had only three months of the 48 in this term. `` There's a long road ahead of us,'' he said. `` And I am optimistic _ that our reforms will produce lasting results, that the long-range planning we do today will pay off in the future, that our consultations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will result in progress in domestic and international affairs as well.'' His success in reaching those goals will determine which historical parallel comes closest to fitting his first hundred days. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, the phase recalls the 1933 special session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> won swift approval of his proposals to deal with the Depression. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it applies to <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s escape from exile and the brief, final campaign that ended in his defeat at <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>.

 The stock market struggled to record a small gain Wednesday in a tepid response to the latest data on the state of the economy. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 2.20 points to 2,389.11. The dollar pushed higher against all major currencies. Gold prices declined. Bond prices were narrowly lower but avoided a sharp drop. Platinum futures prices surged; gasoline futures rose sharply while crude oil and heating oil prices fell; pork prices rallied but cattle were little changed; grain and soybeans were mixed and cocoa prices plunged.

<HEAD>Benetton's U.S. Retail Trade Practices Being Probed</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is investigating certain business practices of <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, focusing on the company's relationships with owners of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> boutiques, according to the Italian apparel maker. The company said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office is conducting a preliminary probe trying to determine whether <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> is a franchisor that should have complied with federal franchise rules. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> made the disclosure in a recently published prospectus for a proposed offering of 8 million American Depositary Shares. A spokesman for the company Wednesday declined to answer questions about the investigation. The document stated, `` Although many of these matters are in a preliminary stage, the company does not believe that their outcome will have a material adverse effect on the company.'' At <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ticknor </PERSON> said she could not confirm or deny whether there is an investigation in progress into the <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> matter. The clothing company said in the prospectus that a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> store owners have alleged in bankruptcy court proceedings that <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> has `` engaged in unfair trade practices and violated certain franchise and other statutes.'' Federal law requires franchisors to make detailed disclosures before selling a franchise. Franchisors must obey various federal laws intended to protect business owners from abusive practices. Some states also have statutes that apply specifically to franchisors. The company markets its clothing for women, men and children through independently owned <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> retail stores. There are about 700 <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the company does not consider itself to have a franchise relationship with the owners. About 70 Independent sales representatives are used to cultivate the development of stores for <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> products in 79 countries. These representatives find investors and store operators to finance, own and manage the retail outlets. They handle the placement of orders to <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> and monitor the stores in their territories. Store owners buy merchandise from <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> and set their own prices. But they do not pay <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> a fee for use of its trade names nor do they pay any royalties based on a percentage of sales or profits, as is frequently the case for franchisees. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987 and 1988 were hurt by a downturn in women's apparel sales and a decline of the dollar against the lira. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales were virtually flat last year while operating margins shrunk. The timing of these factors was particularly bad because they occured after a period of rapid growth in the number of stores in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, some of which were opened in poor locations, the company said in the prospectus. `` As a result of the lower levels of retail sales ... certain store owners have experienced significant difficulties in meeting their payment obligations to the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> said. In 1965, the <PERSON> Benetton </PERSON> family established a privately-held clothing concern that has become known for its colorful sportswear. The family owns more than 80 percent of the company, which earned $ 99.5 million in 1988 on revenue of $ 1.13 billion. The family has been planning to increase public ownership of the company. Proceeds from the offering, which will allow <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> to be listed on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> stock exchanges, will be used to retire debt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled an electric-powered minivan in the capital with a suggestion that the nation's No. 2 automaker would welcome more government involvement to boost the fledgling technology. `` Joint government-industry initiatives are critical if any alternative fuel strategy is going to become a viable national option in the foreseeable future,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McTague </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research. The Aerostar van showed by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> at a hotel near the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was powered by a sodium-sulfur battery, with the drive provided by a motor mounted on the rear axle. The inverter, which converts direct current from the battery to the alternating current needed to run the motor, was a new, lighter and smaller design, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Company officials said the van has a 100-mile driving range and a maximum speed of 65 mph, with acceleration from a standstill to 50 mph in less than 20 seconds. The battery takes eight hours to recharge, the company said. The cost of operating the vehicle, both replacing the battery every three or four years and recharging it, is comparable with the cost of running a gasoline-powered vehicle at today's prices, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Electric-powered vehicles have been put forward as a long-term solution to the problems of diminishing petroleum supplies and increasing air pollution. The system was developed jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and several battery manufacturers. <PERSON> McTague </PERSON> said bringing the vehicle from the prototype stage to commercial practicality would require government support of battery research aimed at bringing down recharge times and `` substantial production to test out'' the vehicles for durability, cost and acceptance. Bill Day, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of public relations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, hinted broadly that the company would need government purchase of the electric vehicles in order to build momentum for their use. `` You've got to read between the lines,'' Days said, citing other instances of new technology, such as air bags, where government purchases created the momentum that led to commercial success. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., planned this week to introduce legislation that would require conversion to cleaner-burning fuels, including electricity, of most vehicles operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and civilian federal agencies, his office said The conversion would commence in 1993 at a rate of 10 percent of the federal fleet per year and would be finished in 2002. With government support and the right market, electrical vehicles could reach the commercial stage within 10 years, <PERSON> McTague </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has provided 95 percent of the $ 20 million spent on the electric vehicle program since 1982 and believes battery technology has reached a stage that would allow practical development of such cars without the need for breakthroughs, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the department's director of electric and hybrid propulsion. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have also been working on electric technology for motor vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also showed a Taurus outfitted with its prototype flexible-fuel system, which can burn both unleaded gasoline and a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s steel-using manufacturers are split over whether steel import quotas should be extended by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration when they expire in the fall. A coalition of manufacturers opposed to the quotas got some competition Wednesday when a rival group led by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> and others was announced to lobby on behalf of the import curbs. The new group claimed to have enlisted 374 members, including makers of automobiles, home appliances, marine products, beverage cans, tableware and farm equipment. The only thing the two coalitions have in common is that all their members use steel as a raw material. The Coalition for a Competitive <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was unveiled at a Capitol press conference Wednesday by Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and executives from <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, Crown <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Can </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, UNR-Leavitt of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and Organizers said the coalition was created to help make the case for continuing steel import quotas due to expire Sept. 30. `` Domestic steel producers have proven they can compete with any steel producer in the world,'' said <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they can not compete with foreign governments that pump billions of dollars in subsidies into their state-owned steel operations.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year, product-by-product `` voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three days before last November's election, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to continue the restraints in some form. But with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe they can make a case for ending the program, or at least narrowing its scope. The quota opponents have been led in part by <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Caterpillar is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Using </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, a 300-member group that claims quotas have driven up steel prices and caused product shortages Members of the new coalition said they formed the group to show that steel-consuming manufacturers are not widely opposed to trade protection, as the older group suggests. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, UNR-Leavitt President <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> government affairs counsel <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> <PERSON> Horstman </PERSON> and Crown <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> and Seal Vice President-Purchasing <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoma </PERSON> released statements chronicling how the quotas had helped turn the ailing steel industry around. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would enable the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to begin negotiating new quota agreements with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s steel-trading partners. But <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Berger </PERSON>, counsel for the older <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Using </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the new group was already on the defensive. `` I think they are concerned that the debate here has been expanded beyond simply what's good for the steel industry. We've succeeded in getting people to understand that the debate is over what's good for the overall economy,'' <PERSON> Berger </PERSON> said

 North American colonials viewed bird's - eye maple as one of nature's defects, but today lumbermen ca n't cut the trees The specks and whirling disfigurations of bird's - eye have become the fad of the wood world, `` It's a very hot wood now. It's hard to say why,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, import veneers specialist for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION> `` It will continue to be until some gentleman decides the trendy wood is something else.'' Foreign buyers are snapping up so much of the rare <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wood that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers have had to turn away domestic customers. The wood has become even harder to find in the last six months, with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> entering the market of would-be buyers. `` I think our shortage of bird's - eye is because we've shipped We ca n't satisfy the guitar makers, the clock manufacturers in our own country,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Owens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. Importers from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> make up the bulk of the foreign trade, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said Wednesday In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, importers are dying the blond wood into all colors of the rainbow, from pink to green. The supply of birdy maple _ as foresters call it _ is scarce, limited to a narrow band through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the Great Lakes. By most estimates, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> produces the bulk of the specialty wood. There, bird's - eye is selling for as high as $ 12.50 per board foot, said <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> forester A conservation group trying to buy a 300-year-old virgin stand of pines along the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>'s northernmost shore gulped when the timber company-owner named its price. The quote was steep, <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said, not because the pines are ripe for cutting, but because of the chance that bird's - eye maples are among the scattered maples in `` They're drooling over the bird's - eye,'' The price for long sections of bird's - eye veneer runs up to $ 2.50 a square foot for a For comparison, walnut veneer runs up to 50 cents a square foot, <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said. But 25 years ago, <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> <PERSON> Glidden </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardwoods </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, tossed his bird's - eye logs aside for `` No one wanted bird's - eye at any price,'' `` Now, the yuppies, the wealthy, they think it's pretty. If anyone has any, it's pretty easy to sell. And the price is going up and up,'' he said. Some companies still throw bird's - eye out with their less One of the most common places to find its dotted planks is among the second-grade maple in gymnasium floors. Meanwhile, scientists remain unable to explain why it looks the way it does. `` What causes bird's Do n't ask me,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a forestry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are a lot of theories _ maybe they are buds that did n't mature _ but none of them has proven out. What can I say? Some trees have it, some do n't.'' <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s - eye maple is hard to cut and the delicate little eyes tend to pop out during planing, wood products And not every log that looks like bird's - eye turns out to be `` `` They're cruddy little nasty logs. You buy 20 logs and maybe five of them have bird's eyes,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of Dooge Veneers in Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. Yet Dooge Veneers sells every bird's - eye maple log it `` Nobody else has it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Grant Boesky Early Release From Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge says convicted stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has already gotten a lot of breaks and does n't deserve to get out of prison early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> rejected a request by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who has already served one year of a three-year prison term, to cut his sentence to time served, paving the way for his immediate release. `` I can not in good conscience conclude that, commendable as <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s behavior has been since he was sentenced, he should be given further credit,'' <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> ruled Wednesday. There was no answer at the offices of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> lawyers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when called for comment Wednesday evening. Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential takeover targets, <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one felony count as part of a plea bargain. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record $ 100 million in 1986 to settle civil insider trading charges brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He has since supplied information used toward civil or criminal charges in more than a dozen cases here and in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In exchange, he was allowed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. The maximum penalty he faced was five years in prison, and <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, who has a reputation as a lenient sentencer, handed <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> a three-year term. <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> noted that even without any actions by him or the parole board, `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> will be released from custody less than a year from today, which is to say, that the actual period he will have served will be slightly more than two years. Such a sentence is not unjust in the circumstances.'' <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s earliest non-parole release date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> claimed that his help led to a record plea bargain deal by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the subsequent indictment of its junk bond chief, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, and others on racketeering and securities fraud charges. <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> said he took <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s `` unprecedented'' cooperation into account when he passed sentence. Federal prosecutors took no stand on releasing <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> early but they noted in a letter to <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, who sentenced <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> Dec. 18, 1987, that the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> indictment and the $ 650 million tentative settlement of criminal charges <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> reached with the government was `` the centerpiece of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation.'' The letter continued: `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures were the essential catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those cases. Other investigations arising directly from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures have also matured since <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s sentencing. But it added that `` the government nevertheless articulated the value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> was sentenced.''

<HEAD>Bid To Finalize Drexel-SEC Deal Again Delayed By Appeals Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is planning another try at finalizing its settlement of civil securities fraud charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that it did not have the authority to switch judges on the case But an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyer said the ruling left open an option for seeking lower court approval of its deal with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> previously barred Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who is assigned to the case, from conducting hearings on the proposed settlement because his impartiality is being challenged before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> by former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who is not part of the settlement. Until the high court decides whether to consider <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s appeal, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> can not take any action in the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> tried to bypass the delay, which could take months, by asking the 2nd Circuit to modify its stay and allow another judge to consider and possibly approve the settlement. The appeals court, however, said `` that decision does not rest with us,'' adding that the final word on assigning the case to another judge `` rests with Judge <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> or with those responsible for the assignment of cases'' at the district court level in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Solicitor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonson </PERSON> said the commission would not ask <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to step aside. `` Rather, we're going to be asking the proper authorities to assign that part of the case to a second judge for the sole purpose of considering the settlement,'' said <PERSON> Gonson </PERSON>, who oversees appeals for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gonson </PERSON> would not comment on what action the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> planned to take, but a three-judge district court panel, the committee on assignments, normally would consider requests for reassignments of cases. Chief Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who chairs the committee, said that if the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requested an assignment change, the panel would consult with <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> before making a decision. The appeals court's refusal to assign a different judge continues to delay the landmark civil settlement as well as <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s record plea bargain to criminal charges. Resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact also is needed before <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> can formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $ 650 million to settle criminal charges brought by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys office. A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said: `` We're going to be consulting with our counsel to see what options we have. We believe the settlement should be implemented because it's in the best interest of everybody.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> originally battled to get <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to excuse himself from the case for an alleged conflict of interest because his wife stands to make a hefty profit from a debt-financed acquisition <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> helped finance. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> refused to step down from the case and the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, which delayed further district court proceedings pending its decision, upheld <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> in November. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> eventually dropped its objections to <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> but the delay was extended when <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, who were both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last month, sought to argue the issue before the Sumpreme Court. The 2nd Circuit has delayed all proceedings before <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> pending a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has not yet decided whether it will hear the appeal.

 <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> launched his proxy fight to unseat the board of directors at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company despite a conflict with the state commerce commissioner, who is threatening to block <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' tender offer in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had until 2 p.m. today to supply `` objective facts'' to Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> describing how he will operate the nation's fourth-largest airline if his $ 2.7 billion tender offer is successful. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Wednesday he will suspend the tender offer in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> if the deadline is not met, blocking the estimated 1,900 shareholders in the state from selling their 1.3 million shares to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. There was no immediate reaction from <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> the option of asking for another hearing on the issue, which would be held tonight. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles-based billionaire proceeded with his proxy fight Wednesday by mailing letters to those who hold the 29.1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the airline's parent. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is lobbying for votes in the election of 11 board members at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s May 15 annual meeting. The <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> nominees would review `` all bona fide offers'' to buy the airline company, including <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' offer, he wrote. `` By voting for our slate, you can mandate the sale of the company,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said in his letter. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s board has rejected <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 90-a-share offer but has pledged to explore alternatives that would maximize shareholder value. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who owns about 2.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, said in his letter that he is skeptical of the claim. He cited the company's refusal to withdraw its `` poison pill'' takeover defense plan and a requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> suitors sign a restrictive confidentiality agreement. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON>, an analyst for Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the odds are against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> winning the proxy fight. `` To oust an existing management is an uphill battle,'' <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would be helped if nine dissident shareholders succeed in their attempt to force <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to change proxy documents that limit the voting to those who held the stock as of March 17. Hennepin County District Judge <PERSON> Delila </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said Wednesday that the request deserves a hearing next week. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cambronne </PERSON>, an attorney for the shareholders, said because more than 65 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock has changed hands since March 17. <PERSON> Rivard </PERSON> said new owners would be more likely to vote for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' slate of nominees because they bought the stock on takeover rumors Working against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in his proxy fight is a provision in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' that would prevent <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' proposed board from selling the company for about six months <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> sought to invalidate the provision in a lawsuit he filed in the Court of Chancery in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. A judge on Tuesday denied his request. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> must explain how he would operate the airline in light of the large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it. `` <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> should objectively state whether -LRB- he -RRB- intends to demand wage and salary, including productivity, concessions from <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> employees,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said he does not intend to sell the airline's strategic assets, reduce payroll or move the headquarters from suburban <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, but his lawyers have indicated he may refinance or sell <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> real estate, reduce travel agent commissions or change <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s in-flight service. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shares closed at $ 100 Wednesday, down 25 cents, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose today against the Japanese yen, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index finished at yet another high. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 190.15 points to a record 33,434.93 close Wednesday, added another 65.90 points, or 0.20 percent, closing at 33,500.83. The index has been climbing since Tuesday, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced he would resign soon over a stock-profiteering and bribery scandal. `` Alhough it -LRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation announcement -RRB- was not good news, it reassured investors, who thought they finally had got rid of one negative element,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. But institutional investors remained on the sidelines, mainly due to remaining uncertainties over politics and over interest rates, the analyst said. Many market players speculate that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> may raise interest rates soon to slow economic growth and combat inflation.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is promising `` corrective surgery'' on a $ 4.7 billion emergency spending bill that failed when members of his own party broke ranks on the first major budget vote of the year. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his leadership team will have their first opportunity to recoup next week, when they plan to bring to the floor their plan to implement a separate deficit-reduction pact with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promised to retool the emergency spending measure that was labeled a `` budget buster'' and rejected Wednesday by Republicans and Democrats at both ends of the ideological spectrum. The bill to expand current spending for veterans, anti-drug programs and other popular initiatives was forced back to committee after a leadership amendment to address the budget-busting complaints was defeated 252-172. The timing of the defeat was bad for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who is trying to show he can still command the House while besieged by an ethics committee probe into his personal finances. Only a day earlier, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had confidently predicted passage of the legislation. However, lawmakers of both parties doubted Wednesday's vote was a direct reflection on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s powers. `` I do n't think it reflects on leadership problems,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` This is not a vote of confidence issue. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had proposed in the amendment to trim other programs _ including $ 1 billion from the military _ to help offset the cost of the new bill. But White House budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> sent lawmakers a statement in which he said he would urge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to veto the `` fiscally irresponsible'' measure. And in a letter to House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the military cuts would force the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to stop paying re-enlistment bonuses, reduce training hours, eliminate five to 10 construction projects, lay off scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing `` This would have very serious consequences for the manning of our forces,'' he wrote, adding that he, too, would seek a veto. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said the vote was largely decided by the defense issue and individual members' concerns about specific domestic programs. If there was any indication about the Democratic leadership, it might be that the party vote-counting in the House was made a little inaccurate from the lack of legislative activity so far this year, he said. `` Because we have not been really focused legislatively, members have n't been giving accurate readings'' on their position, he said. The Republicans, meanwhile, were free to exercise rebelliousness because they `` have no responsibility,'' he said. Republicans were actively participating, however, in closed-door drafting sessions on the fiscal 1990 budget. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, carrying forth the deficit-eduction pact announced at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, has been filling in some of the details on how to guide the spending and tax bills <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will consider this year. After several days of cutting deals in secret, on issues ranging from child care to bank insurance fees for foreign investors, the committee planned a public session today for passing the $ 1.17 trillion budget. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could then take up the plan as early as next week, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also plans action on its version of the budget. Budget chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., supported the <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> amendment to the spending bill that was sent back to committee But he said he was not unhappy that the bill was sent back, so that the deficit-reduction agreement could move on the legislative calendar before a measure some saw as a deficit increaser. While he was defeated on his amendment, `` the purpose of the amendment was in part achieved'' because the bill would be revised, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The bill rejected Wednesday was titled by its supporters `` Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations,'' and it included increases requested by the president. But the budget committee had declined to go along with his proposal to offset the increases by cutting other domestic programs and not defense. The bill included $ 1.2 billion for veterans programs, $ 892 million for guaranteed student loans, $ 822 million for anti-drug efforts and $ 600 million for last year's forest fire costs. The $ 4.7 billion measure would also provide $ 423 million for state foster care programs, $ 250 million for reparations for Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, $ 154 million for the homeless, $ 127 million for unemployment assistance, $ 100 million for refugee assistance, and $ 88 million for public housing. Without offsetting cuts, the bill would add to a deficit this year that already is expected to exceed the Gramm-Rudman law's $ 135 billion target by $ 30 billion.

<HEAD>Corporate Jet Hit By Graffiti _ From Its Own Maintenance Experts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A corporate jet worth over $ 1 million was sprayed, signed and decorated with graffiti in an exuberant display of `` fun'' by the same aviation experts who lovingly maintain it. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, director of marketing for the Englewood-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to display the company's unconventionalism `` It was our chance to be irreverent, I guess,'' he said of the recent treatment of the jet. `` We treat these planes with such kid gloves all the time, polishing, cleaning and maintaining them like gems. We were having fun.'' The paint job _ a menacing open shark's jaw on the nose, ganglike logos in day-glo colors on its fuselage and one graffiti tag that said, `` Elvis on board'' _ however, was temporary. The six-passenger jet had reached 20 years of age and 12,000 air hours, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at that point requires a complete dismantling and overhaul of an aircraft's engine, electronic and navigational systems Part of that is a new paint job, officials said. So before the jet was flown to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where the exterior is to be stripped and repainted in a respectable white-on-blue with red and gray stripes, the company decided the have a little fun. `` We figured it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to graffiti something that's worth over $ 1 million and still not get in trouble for it,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Strangfeld </PERSON>, the firm's maintenance director. The paint job at <LOCATION> Centennial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, south of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area, pleased officials so much they flew to <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> and left it on the runway for a few hours to attract gawkers and amateur photographers. It created a similar reaction in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, officials said. `` It was fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Strangfled </PERSON>. `` When we got there, it basically emptied the whole <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> facility.'' The $ 350,000 overhaul ordered by International Jet official <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Milam </PERSON> is a four-week operation that also saved the company $ 6 million for a new Learjet.

<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to eliminate 600 jobs nationwide, a cut that amounts to about 3 percent of the semiconductor maker's workforce of 21,700. The company said on Wednesday it made the decision involving five <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> facilities in order to reduce costs and remain competitive. `` We operate in an aggressive, unforgiving marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive. `` While our financial position is solid and demand for our products is strong, our objective is to make sure we stay in good shape as we enter the'90s.'' Apart from <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the job cuts affect <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> plants in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. About 100 positions will be eliminated at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> headquarters and a manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> plant will feel the least impact, said the company, adding it will try to move employees into other job openings and predicting that only a small number will be laid off. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> also announced that the Chandler plant, which makes older-technology logic chips and microcontrollers, has excess production capacity. It will begin a five-day rather than six-day work week. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> two weeks ago reported first-quarter profits of $ 97 million _ a 3.5 percent jump over the year-earlier period. The company is the sole supplier of microprocessors for all high-end personal computers that use IBM-compatible software.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' $ 15.7 billion order for as many as 370 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft was prompted in part by public perceptions that new jets are safer than old ones, Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said Wednesday's order, the largest ever to a single aircraft manufacturer, primarily reflects <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to expand its fleet and regain the title of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest airline. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> also will replace some of its aging planes, he said. The Chicago-based airline has one of the oldest fleets in the industry, with an average age of 13.5 years. Although <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said airplanes will fly `` forever'' if maintained properly, the decision to replace some <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jets was `` motivated by two things: the cost of maintaining older aircraft and public perception of older aircraft.'' `` Some things have happened of late to focus the consumer and focus <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the issue of aging aircraft,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` But in terms of that being a prod, this is a business decision we were flowing toward anyway.'' Among the recent incidents focusing attention on aging aircraft was a Feb. 24 accident in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> involving a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. The forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off shortly after the plane left <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, killing nine passengers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> finished a second day of hearings into that accident Tuesday in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but officials of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said the timing of their announcement was purely coincidental. The package includes firm orders for 180 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners and options on 190 others. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s order came just one week after <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an aircraft leasing firm, ordered $ 17 billion in jets from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>. In another coup for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said today it plans to spend around 2 billion Dutch guilders, or $ 940 million, to buy five new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400s and ten new 737s. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> said the purchases are part of a program to standardize the type of planes it flies. United is the nation's second-largest carrier, behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. During the first quarter of 1989, American flew 16.89 percent of the total domestic revenue passenger miles to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 16.73 percent <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s order includes firm plans for 120 twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s and 60 narrow-body 757s, plus options on 130 737s and 60 757s. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said it has ordered engines from <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the French jet-engine maker <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>, for the 737 jetliners. The order is potentially worth $ 2 billion, <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The 757s will be powered by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> engines with a potential total value of $ 1.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said the engine costs were included in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 15.7 billion estimate for the entire package. It had been known for six months that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was preparing a large order for 737s and 757s. But the airline wanted to hold off ordering while it tried to get contract concessions from its pilots and flight attendants unions. The airline is still negotiating with those workers but has come under increasing pressure to buy planes and lock in delivery positions because its competitors _ including <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ have placed orders in recent months. `` I guess they've decided to go ahead and show their good faith'' to the unions, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst who follows airlines for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He said the size of the order was a surprise but `` it's what's needed to maintain their growth and their position in the industry in the next 10 years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today began considering an administration-endorsed effort to make owners of savings and loans put up more of their own actual money than President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially sought as the price for a $ 100 billion taxpayer bailout of the industry. After closing a loophole that has allowed some nearly insolvent thrifts to challenge in court their takeover by federal regulators, the committee began debating a measure that would shift some of the risk of S & amp; L lending from the government's insurance funds. `` Without real capital _ hard capital _ the taxpayers have no protection,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, the committee's chairman <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> likened `` good will'' exemptions from hard cash, stock or other equity capital requirements that the government over the past eight years has granted to S & amp; Ls to `` a soft ice-cream cone in the July sun.'' `` Good will provides nothing if the institution goes down,'' he said. `` This entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the savings and loans operate. We can not in good conscience require the taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell them they must bear all the future risks.'' Earlier today, the committee approved an amendment specifying that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has the authority to take over <ORGANIZATION> sick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls even before they are technically insolvent. Two <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrifts are challenging in court their takeovers earlier this year by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which claims it already has that authority although it is not spelled out specfically in the law. `` As long as somebody can go into court, they can get a week's delay and essentially break the institution by selling off its assets during that week,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the amendment `` And who ends up paying is us.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Wednesday to require the savings and loan industry to pour $ 75 million a year of its profits into low-income housing subsidies as another price for the bailout. The measure, approved on a 27-24 vote with four Democrats joining all 20 committee Republicans in opposition, could provide up to 500,000 home buyers a 2 percentage point discount on their home mortgages, according to consumer groups. However, the political party lines are a little more obscure in that fight over tougher capital standards. The administration, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and the committee's ranking Republican, Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, all favor making <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners put up $ 2.25 of their own `` real money'' or `` tangible'' capital for each $ 100 of lending. S & amp; L supporters, claiming a third of the 2,950 surviving thrifts in the nation could be wiped out by that stiff a requirement, favor a $ 1.50 `` tangible'' capital requirement adopted last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's financial institutions subcommittee. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original proposal had no tangible capital requirement, but <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Wednesday that the administration now believes there should now be a minimum $ 3 tangible capital requirement for every $ 100 in loans. However, in a letter to <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> called his and <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' amendment calling for $ 2.25 `` a marked and welcome improvement. <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> led the opposition to <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' amendment to require the 12 regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> to set aside 5 percent of their profits _ $ 1.5 billion last year _ for providing low-interest mortgage loans to the working poor. The regional banks, although created by the federal government, are owned by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry and pass their profits on to individual S & amp; Ls. The legislation already requires S & amp; Ls to put up $ 300,000 a year through the regional banks as their contribution to the bailout's costs But taxpayers still will assume at least 70 percent of the estimated $ 250 billion to $ 300 billion burden over the next 30 years. Democrats said the directed industry subsidies would restore the original purpose of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> system when it was established in the 1930s to promote home ownership among working families. Without it, they said, there's no reason for a separate S & amp; L industry. `` We've invited the taxpayers to the bailout banquet and told them they can pick up the tab, but they've got no silverware, no salad, no entrees,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleczka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>. `` The least we can give them is some of the leftovers. Republicans, however, complained that making the industry devote a portion of its profits is nothing more than an `` end-around play'' for subsidized housing and called it a symbol of fiscal irresponsibility. `` At stake in this bill is the safety and confidence in the financial fabric of this nation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>. `` To play social policy games with this legislation jeopardizes confidence in the system.'' The four Democrats siding with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> were Reps. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The committee also got into a First Amendment fight over trying to stop advertising by some banks claiming that their federal insurance fund is safer than the one protecting S & amp; L depositors against losses of up to $ 100,000 each. It eventually voted 32-10 in favor of an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., directing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw ads that `` disparage the condition of either fund.

 The stock market rallied sharply today amid mounting hopes for evidence of reduced inflationary pressures.

Analysts expect a fresh sign of slowing economic growth when the government reports Friday on the index of leading economic indicators for March. The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends, is expected to show a decline of about 0.6 percent, after falling 0.3 percent in February. That would provide some additional encouragement for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> not to tighten credit in the immediate future.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today said its first-quarter earnings rose nearly 1 percent to $ 1.64 billion, the second-most profitable three-month period in automotive history. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest automaker, said its first-quarter results translated to $ 3.44 per share, and compared with earnings of $ 1.62 billion, or $ 3.31 per share, in the first three months of 1988. Revenue totaled $ 25.87 billion, up 11.5 percent from $ 23.2 billion during the first three months of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> set a quarterly industry earnings record during the second quarter last year, posting $ 1.66 billion in profit. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last week reported its first-quarter earnings were $ 1.55 billion, 42.2 percent more than the same period last year, when the company changed its accounting method. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings came on revenue of $ 29.6 billion and worked out to $ 2.37 a share <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to release first-quarter results next week. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its first-quarter profit was buoyed by increased profits overseas, a continuing source of money for the automaker. The company said its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> profits fell 5.6 percent to $ 800 million during the quarter, principally because of sluggish sales and costs of incentives. On March 29, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> set off the latest chain reaction of new incentive programs by offering financing as low as 2.9 percent on two-year loans and increasing cash rebates and the number of vehicles covered by the program. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> followed a day later, and in less than a week, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> announced its own package, offering interest-free financing on two-year notes. The costs of the incentives are borne almost entirely by manufacturers. Although the programs were announced at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter, they affect a large number of cars the Big Three produced during the first three-month period of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also said earnings by its financial services subsidiary, which provides consumer car loans among other things, fell 41.3 percent to $ 141 million from $ 240 million. The company said profits were squeezed by rising interest on the money it borrowed and lower interest payments from the money it loaned, apparently through incentives. The financial services made up 8.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s profit, while its automobile operations made up 91.4 percent. First-quarter profits in the automotive sector rose 8.2 percent to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.38 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday reported a 4 percent increase in net income for the first quarter, reflecting strong domestic revenues from its business products and the benefits of a restructuring undertaken in January First-quarter net income was $ 158 million on revenues of $ 4.1 billion, compared to net income of $ 152 million on revenues of $ 3.8 billion for the same period a year ago. Earnings per share rose 8 percent to $ 1.48, compared to $ 1.37 for the first-quarter of 1988. `` These results indicate that we are off to a good start for the year and include the early success of the important restructuring of our business products and systems operations that we have undertaken to enhance shareholder value,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.

<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> is winning praise for his handling of tough issues for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as head of a department touched by a wide range of crises. The former federal prosecutor and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mass transit administrator joined the new administration as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> outsider but is rapidly becoming one of the most visible members of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this week on his second diplomatic mission concerning international air terrorism, has been <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man on several issues that might have been handled by officials in other departments <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing, `` I'm not going to take a back seat.'' He was referring to possible disagreements with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over foreign air agreements, but he has climbed into the front seat on other issues as well, including air terrorism, drug interdiction, the Alaskan oil spill and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s European trip followed a meeting he and British transport officials organized in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to push for a coordinated defense against air terrorism. He earlier traveled to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to assess anti-drug activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. When the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil and creating an environmental disaster, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> as the lead Cabinet officer dealing with the clean-up. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has responsibility over all air, sea, and ground transportation, as well as pipelines and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` On balance, he's addressed most issues professionally and frontally, with moxie and political skill,'' said aviation consultant <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparkman </PERSON>. `` Both businesswise and socially, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s a winner.'' Subordinates at <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> describe <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> as tough but personable. Reporters who suggest ulterior motives in any of his high-profile actions, get a curt, `` You do n't know me very well.'' But at the end of his first press briefing, he softened his tough image by pulling out a model airplane that played the tune `` Fly Me to the Moon.'' Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> say <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was the first administration official to show them compassion and listen to their complaints about government action or inaction in the case. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who headed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, has received praise for his administrative skill from both Democrats and Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and from all sides in the transportation industry, although not all of his positions have been popular with both management and labor. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> `` a breath of fresh air'' before unanimous confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s toughest critics have been in the Machinists' union, which had tried to get the administration to step in and prevent the March 4 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strike. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> recommended against it and then defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaction to the unions and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are extremely disappointed in his running of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and hope in the future he will not automatically side with management,'' said Machinists' spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Conley </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which joined the walkout, and members of the independent <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also expressed dismay at the administration's refusal to step in. Eastern, which since has shut down most of its operations and filed for reorganization under bankruptcy laws, opposed government action. In some other matters, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> has defied corporate interests. He joined <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> in recommending tougher mileage standards for automobiles, and he is insisting that airlines pay for devices he has ordered installed in airports to scan luggage for plastic explosives. But even officials who disagree with some of <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>'s positions give him high marks as an administrator. `` He's clearly emerging as a very good secretary of transportation,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> which represents major airlines and believes the government should pay for security. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aaronson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ATA </ORGANIZATION> president, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> inherited an inadequate system and faces insufficient airports, understaffed air traffic control operations, and tough security problems. The airlines want the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> split off as a separate agency. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, called <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> `` a very practical person in political terms.'' His appeals to transit authorities to seek funding from sources other than the federal government are well received by transit officials because they believe he is sincere and understands the complexity of the industry, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroads </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> `` has been warmly received by the railroad industry.''

<HEAD>Sony to Set Up California Center for HDTV Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will research high-definition television at a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> facility as part of a `` long-term commitment to building an extensive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> engineering and manufacturing base,'' the company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is hoping its <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will help it localize products for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market while defusing political tensions over the next generation of television. `` Today HDTV is being held hostage as a symbol of the need for improving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> competitiveness. This is in our opinion most unfortunate,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dussen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said at a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is contributing to the country as much as any U.S.-based company would, by locating factories and laboratories in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and buying parts locally, <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dussen </PERSON> said. The center has 25 engineers and will eventually expand to 50, roughly 80 percent of them Americans, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said. The center will focus on HDTV editing and production equipment rather than on the televisions themselves. `` <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s approach to technology development is global,'' said <PERSON> Masaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` At the same time, we recognize that many contributions are local.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is a world leader in HDTV. It has made HDTV production equipment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since 1984 and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for about two years. Japanese industry overall has a large lead over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns in developing HDTV, which promises motion picture quality images and compact disc quality sound and is expected to be a $ 50 billion industry by the year 2000. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> is among dozens of companies that have applied for $ 30 million in HDTV research funds being made available by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION>. Some lawmakers have said they did n't want to see <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tax dollars going to foreign companies to develop a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> HDTV industry. But <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dussen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would benefit if <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> got <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> money because the company would transfer technology from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to this country as part of its project. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> has made two offers seeking less than $ 10 million in <ORGANIZATION> DARPA </ORGANIZATION> funding. `` This was more of a good will or outreach program on our part to allow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to own and take advantage of the techniques we had developed over the years,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>'s advanced systems group, said in a telephone interview. If <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> got <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds for HDTV research, the studies would take place at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> facility, <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said. Prior to consolidation in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had operated the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, together with an engineering and technical support facility in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The center since 1980 has actively supported HDTV development efforts in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and has undertaken some direct HDTV work, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> said the new center will develop products for the motion picture and TV industries. He pointed to a recent agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Panavision </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of 35mm movie cameras, to adapt <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HDTV </ORGANIZATION> cameras for motion picture production as an example of the kialition of Japanese and American firms that supports the so-called 1,125 scan-line, 60 frame rate HDTV production standard. <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> for a number of years has produced studio production and editing equipment based on the 1,125-60 standard. <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> emphasized that <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> still supports that standard although a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasters seem to be backing away from it in the face of adamant opposition from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> companies that want a standard based on a 50 frame rate.

 A boom in international charter traffic may mean long delays and diversion of flights from the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> airport this summer unless the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> can increase the number of inspectors, officials say. The bulk of international traffic here is handled by charter carriers, and the staffing crunch for customs and immigration inspectors affects only those flights, not scheduled international service by carriers such as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Icelandair </ORGANIZATION>. Local officials are lobbying <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation to get more inspectors assigned to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, the gateway to <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, Sea World and other nearby attractions. The number of foreign travelers at <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> jumped 36 percent in 1988 to 742,786, and the rapid growth has continued so far this year. `` We've done everything we can,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwicker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Custom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s district director for north and central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be real tight.'' Customs has nine inspectors to process passengers, baggage and cargo arriving on international charter flights. Immigration has 26 full - and part-time workers who process charter passengers Airport officials said they expect federal legislation this year to provide the needed inspectors, although it may not be quick enough to prevent flights from being diverted.

 <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> has approached the <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about a possible merger and the two companies are discussing both an acquisition and financial support from <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> for construction projects. P & amp; W and <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> issued a joint statement Wednesday during P & amp; W's annual shareholders' meeting saying the companies have begun talks to `` explore the advantages of reaching an agreement which could lead to the generation of additional freight traffic for the benefit of both parties. The talks could lead to P & amp; W's acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>; an infusion of capital from <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> to P & amp; W; or joint efforts to build more freight facilities on P & amp; W lines, the statement said. P & amp; W won its independence from the old <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> railroad in a 1973 court ruling, and has grown since then from a 44-mile line linking its namesake cities to a 375-mile system, with 175 employees, that serves <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Much of P & amp; W's growth has come by absorbing former <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> lines that the larger railroad abandoned as unprofitable. P & amp; W is now the only freight railroad in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> has 32,600 employees and operates on 13,100 miles of track in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. If it acquires the P & amp; W, it would be <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s first acquisition of another railroad since it was spun off from government control in 1987. P & amp; W posted net profits of $ 3.9 million, or $ 1.95 a share, last year, on $ 21.4 million in revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s net profits were $ 306 million, or $ 4.44 a share, last year on revenues of almost $ 3.5 billion. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a transportation analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered, said P & amp; W's revenues were `` almost insignificant'' to the larger railroad `` My guess is they want a specific line,'' he said. P & amp; W interchanges freight cars with <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> and the two railroads recently completed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s first facilities for handling double-stacked container trains. The work included raising bridges on <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s main line into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and track renovations on the <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; W's line here.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is shutting down its supercomputer business, Thursday reported a 55 percent decline in earnings in the first quarter. First-quarter earnings were $ 3.5 million, or 8 cents a share, on revenues of $ 843.5 million, compared with earnings of $ 7.7 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenues of $ 902.2 million for the same period a year ago. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said it would shut down its supercomputer business, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, and make other cuts that would result in restructuring charges of $ 490 million and 3,100 layoffs. Of the estimated charges, $ 350 million was to be from liquidation of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, the supercomputer subsidiary started in 1983 to compete with Twin Cities rival <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and other supercomputer makers. The company also announced it would streamline the Cyber mainframe business. `` With restructuring charges of approximately $ 490 million, we will obviously report a large loss for the second quarter,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement today. `` However, the actions we have taken enable <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> to focus on its Cyber mainframe customers' needs and to have a profitable second half in 1989,'' Price said. ETA, which employed 800 people, lost $ 100 million in 1988 and never made money for the company. Control Data provides computer products and services for business, scientific and engineering applications worldwide. The company's last good year financially was 1983, when it posted profits of $ 161.7 million. It earned $ 1.7 million last year and $ 19.3 million in 1987 and lost a total of $ 832 million in 1986 and 1985. It also lost money in the last two quarters of 1988, including a $ 12.8 million loss in the fourth quarter.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday they had signed a 15-year promotional agreement that is one of the longest and most comprehensive either company has ever entered. `` There is n't a division of our company or a subdivision, for that matter, that is n't involved in this agreement,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> will pay Disney an undisclosed `` multimillion-dollar'' amount for the various promotional opportunities and serve as official supplier of film, batteries, cameras, still video and other photographic products. Disney has agreed to exclusively use <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> movie film at its movie studios and exclusively sell <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> photographic products when available. Instant film, which <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> does not sell, will be supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The old agreement, which was due to expire soon, only covered the sale of film at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and the use of Disney characters. The key to the agreement, which enlarges an alliance the two firms have had since the early 1980s, is EuroDisneyland, which is scheduled to open in 1992. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 5 percent of the 14 billion amateur snapshots taken in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year are snapped on Disney property. That's roughly 700 million photos. `` If 5 percent of the pictures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are taken at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> theme parks, we'd be delighted if 5 percent taken in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were taken at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> theme parks,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON>, vice chairman and executive officer at <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. Disney's Japanese park in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is not included in the agreement, but the Spruce Goose and the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, both Disney-owned attractions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, will be included. `` Because we've been together now for several years and have gotten very used to each other, we knew we wanted to set a course for many more years,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said after signing the contract Wednesday. `` You get <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> people together, thinking up ideas and everything seems to multiply,'' said <PERSON> Samper </PERSON>. `` There is, I would dare say, twice the ways of reaching the public in terms of the volume of what we do ... then when the original agreement was done,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. The companies have been involved with each other for more than 50 years. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was an early participant at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>, which opened in 1955, and was a sponsor of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Wonderful World of Color'' television show in the late 1950s when only 700,000 color TV sets existed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Teen-Agers More Inclined To Radio Than Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Teen-agers are more likely to listen to the radio than to read a newspaper on an average day, says a survey presented to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Ninety-three percent of the young people surveyed, ages 12 to 17, said they listened to the radio during an average weekday. Forty-one percent said they read a newspaper and 23 percent said they watched an evening television news broadcast on an average weekday. `` Radio is basically an entertainment media, a background media,'' said <PERSON> Dotty </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, senior project director for the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many of teens that I talked to said, ` Hey, I got the radio on in the background while I'm doing my homework, talking to my friend. They did not usually just sit there and listen to the radio by itself. Reading a newspaper is a much more focused activity.'' The survey, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> last year, was presented to the publishers' group Wednesday, the final day of the <ORGANIZATION> ANPA </ORGANIZATION> convention. It was based on interviews with 1,074 teens in a period late last year marked by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and a space shuttle flight. Thirty-eight percent of the teen-agers surveyed said they could think of a news item during that period that was notable to them. Twenty-five percent listed newspapers as their prime source for the time of interest while 47 percent gave television as their source. Teens tend to be introduced to newspapers through the comics, said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, retiring executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, who presented the survey to the publishers. He urged the publishers and editors to spread stories of interest to teens throughout the paper and not `` assign them to an editorial ghetto.'' <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, a media consultant from <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, warned publishers to stop `` tinkering at the margins'' of papers by making editorial changes and, instead, to consider `` rethinking the whole style, the whole presentation'' in trying to lure teens.

<HEAD>Public Works Projects Halt Decline In Construction</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Friday AMs; Embargo set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spurt of public works projects in March halted a decline in the value of the nation's construction contracts, although housing and non-residential building projects continued to slide, according to figures released Thursday. The F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the value of new construction edged up 1 percent to a projected annual rate of $ 236.1 billion. The slight increase, which followed a 7 percent decline in February, resulted from a 22 percent rise in non-building construction from the previous month. For March, public works and utilities construction climbed to an annualized total value of $ 49.2 billion, compared with $ 40.3 billion in February. For the entire first quarter, however, the unadjusted total of all newly started construction stood at $ 53 billion, a decline of 3 percent from the same period a year ago. `` First quarter data show that the 1989 rate of contracting was nearly 10 percent below its peak reached in mid-1987,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, F.W. Dodge's chief economist. `` Two-thirds of the cutback since then can be accounted for by just two building types _ offices and apartments.'' The unadjusted value of non-residential building construction fell 4 percent in the first quarter to $ 18.6 billion, compared with $ 19.3 billion in the first quarter last year. From February to March, the adjusted annual value of non-residential building construction fell 5 percent to $ 78.4 billion. The annualized value of residential construction also declined in March, falling 1 percent to $ 108.4 billion.

<HEAD>Ford Earnings Up 0.8 Percent In Second Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s first quarter profit was 0.8 percent higher than in the same period last year as overseas earnings offset a drop in domestic profits, the automaker reported Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its profit of $ 1.64 billion, or $ 3.44 a share, came on revenue of $ 25.87 billion. That compared with a profit of $ 1.62 billion, or $ 3.31 per share, on revenue of $ 23.19 billion a year earlier. A week ago, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported it earned $ 1.55 billion, or $ 2.37 per common share, on revenues of $ 29.6 billion during the first three months of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was expected to announce its first-quarter results next week. At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Vice President and Treasurer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s first-quarter profits were buoyed by a 10 percent increase in overseas earnings. Earnings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the basis for profit-sharing computations, fell 5.6 percent to $ 800 million and could continue to slump, he said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was cutting about 2 percent from its second-quarter production schedule, but much of it would come out of overtime. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also reported earnings for its car-financing arm, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, dropped 49.1 percent to $ 101.6 million from $ 199.7 million. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said the decline mainly stemmed from rising costs of borrowing and lower profit margins, due partly to costs of buyer incentive programs. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s cost of borrowing in the first quarter this year was 9.2 percent compared with 8 percent a year earlier. Rising interest rates _ prompted by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> credit-tightening moves aimed at slowing the economy to curb inflation _ and slower-than-anticipated car and truck sales prompted <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on March 29 to begin offering new buyer incentive programs featuring cut-rate auto loans. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> followed suit with similar programs. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> the company expected an economic slowdown over the rest of the year, which would keep the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> from pushing interest rates higher. <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said he expected interest rates actually to fall during the second half of the year. The costs of the latest incentives should affect the corporation's second quarter earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> earnned an industry record $ 1.66 billion in second quarter 1988. The incentives expire May 31 but could be extended. Financial services made up 8.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s profit, while its automobile operations made up 91.4 percent. First-quarter profits in the automotive sector rose 8.2 percent to $ 1.5 billion from $ 1.38 billion. When asked if <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for all of 1989 would be lower than the $ 5.3 billion it earned last year, <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said, `` At this point, that would be the guess.'' During the first 20 days of April, with the incentives in full force, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales increased 27.3 percent over the same time last year. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s sales rose 7.2 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s were off 1.2 percent compared with the same time last year <PERSON> McCammon </PERSON> said he could n't be specific about the costs of the incentives, but the new package costs the company between $ 100 and $ 150 a vehicle more than the previous package did. Accordingly, if <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate that 55 percent of the non-fleet cars it sells are covered by the incentive package, the company has paid an extra $ 7.6 million to $ 11.4 million in incentive costs for the cars sold during the first 20 days of this month.

 Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual funds fell $ 435.5 million in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The decline, to $ 303.0 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $ 790.4 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. The decline, from the record of $ 303.43 billion set last week, broke 15 consecutive record-setting weeks during which the funds' assets posted gains as interest-bearing investments became increasingly popular due to rising rates The decline `` came in the wake of plateauing of -LRB- money market -RRB- yields both in absolute terms and relative to yields offered to individual investors by competing short-term instruments,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist at the institute. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 232 general purpose funds fell $ 129.9 million to $ 99.67 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds dropped $ 1.23 billion to $ 129.02 billion, while assets of 141 institutional funds rose $ 921.3 million to $ 74.32 billion.

 Troubled appliance maker <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday reported a $ 4.6 million second-quarter loss as the company's bankruptcy-related expenses increased and competition toughened. The loss, in the fiscal period ended April 2, widened slightly from a $ 4.5 million loss posted in the year-ago period. Sales during the period rose 5.3 percent to $ 268.3 million, from $ 254.7 million a year ago. The company, which filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in February 1988, has asked a bankruptcy judge to approve a plan that would allow <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> to acquire a 62 percent stake in the company for $ 750 million in cash and securities.

The Pittsburgh-based company produces <PERSON> Oster </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sunbeam </ORGANIZATION> small appliances, along with barbecue grills, lawn and patio furniture, electric blankets, scales and instruments. Barbecue grill and outdoor furniture sales and operating income improved over the 1988 period, but profit margins declined in small appliances due to competition from other manufacturers, the company said. For the first two fiscal quarters, <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 2.83 million on sales of $ 495.3 million, compared with a loss of $ 2.74 million on sales of $ 511 million in the 1988 period.

 The stock market rallied Thursday in buying ascribed to hopes for favorable news on the inflation outlook. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 29.88 points to 2,418.99, a new high since the crash in October, 1987. Its previous recovery peak had been 2,409.46 last Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,021 up, 485 down and 459 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 191.17 million shares, up from 146.09 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 226.18 million shares. Analysts expect a fresh sign of slowing economic growth when the government reports Friday on the index of leading economic indicators for March. The index, which is designed to detect future economic trends, is expected to show a decline of about 0.6 percent, after falling 0.3 percent in February. That would provide some additional encouragement for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> not to tighten credit in the immediate future. Wall Streeters generally agree that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has lately been following a neutral credit policy, watching to see the effects of a year-long bout of credit-tightening intended to keep inflation in check. Buying by professional traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving options and futures on stock indexes helped fuel the market's advance, brokers said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which received a big order for planes from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, rose 1 -RCB- to 75 -RCB- in active trading. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> gained 3 -LCB- to 52 -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> picked up | to 48 | A GE venture and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> subsidiary are to produce engines for the aircraft.

 Wall Street's three-year scandal binge, capped by the recent <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> fraud case settlements, has sapped investor confidence and forced investment firms and securities regulators to re-examine compliance procedures, experts said Thursday. `` Newspaper stories about <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> hardly ensure deep confidence in the public in the financial markets,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, referring to four of the decade's most prominent insider trading cases. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> regional director in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was one of more than 200 state regulators, government prosecutors and investment executives attending a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> conference on the impact of white-collar crime on public policy. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> and others called for greater self-policing by securities and commodities firms to help prevent fraud. Under its landmark settlement of fraud and insider trading charges with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> pledged to boost its internal compliance measures and agreed to tight <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> monitoring for three years. Securities regulators said implementation of the deal was being closely watched for indications whether it prompts other firms to toughen internal compliance measures as a deterrent to market-related crime. `` <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will be an example for other companies who do n't want to be the next one,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, securities administrator for <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, who heads a panel preparing action by that state against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. She said amendments <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved last year to the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act also should put pressure on individual firms. Brokerages now can be held liable for failing to enforce their own internal control procedures. `` I think things like the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> settlement are just the beginning,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` I think regulators are going to be looking at these procedures to see if it works.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., a member of two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees examining securities law reform, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely would be pressed this term to boost <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> funding and allow the commission to fine individuals up to $ 100,000 per violation and institutions up to $ 500,000 for securities law violations `` They do n't have the resources to deal with two major cases at once without the rest of the agency's caseload being altered,'' he said. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> would n't characterize <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> deal and its $ 650 million plea settlement with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's offices as inadequate, but said: `` Certainly the sum of money is very large by anybody's pocketbook calculation But as incredible as it seems, it's about in the ballpark of what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> makes in one year.'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is the former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk bond financier who was named in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and later charged in a separate 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment. The government claims he made more than $ 1 billion in four years, including $ 550 million in 1987. <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Wall Street brokerage house, said the industry already spends $ 300 million annually on self-regulation and routinely cooperates with authorities. `` That does n't mean we're going to catch all those who abuse others and the system,'' he said. `` It does mean we'll do everything we can to prevent it.'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, a judge in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the major Wall Street securities fraud cases are being tried, said the case of broker <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> _ whose revelations led prosecutors to notorious insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> _ was `` tied up with a bow and delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'' because of internal compliance by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s firm

The agreement must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which has had oversight of such deals since Eastern filed March 9 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection. `` We had indicated we would be raising about $ 1.8 billion through assets sales,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. `` This is certainly the first step in this direction for the new, reduced-size airline.'' Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> described the planned streamlining of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, after parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> ruled out a sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in its entirety. Bakes said Eastern would rebuild with a smaller airline and pay its debts by slashing service 29 percent from pre-strike levels and selling assets. Eastern's unions, on strike since March 4, continue to hope the bankruptcy court and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors will call for a sale of the airline. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has set for May 3 a hearing on why Eastern should n't be sold to the highest bidder in its entirety, including its Northeast shuttle service slated to be sold to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said there was considerable industry interest in Eastern assets such as planes, airport gates and routes and that the beleaguered company was receiving good offers. `` There's a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other carriers that are expanding,'' she said. `` The delivery positions and orders are backed up in the factories.'' She said she did n't have any information on other asset sales in the works, but added, `` there have been many interested parties. Obviously, there are going to be other transactions.'' Eastern's plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft, down from around 250 before the strike. If the 14 149-seat 727 planes are leased to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> at $ 115,000 a month and another 21 of the 727s are sold to Trump in the planned shuttle sale, that would leave Eastern with 60 other `` excess aircraft for sale or long-term lease,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said the airline's unions oppose any transfer of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets while hoping the bankruptcy court will approve a buyout of the whole company. `` They can make all the plans they want,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said. `` I think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from the bankruptcy court. That's a fairly lengthy process and it's not going to happen overnight.'' The shuttle sale also must be approved by the court.

<HEAD>Silver Prices Drop On Supply Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Silver futures prices dropped sharply Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on selling prompted by indications of ample supplies On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices fell, cattle lost ground while hog prices rallied, and wheat and soybean futures slipped while corn rose. Silver settled 11.8 cents to 15.2 cents lower, with May at $ 5.64 a troy ounce. Pressure built in the silver market ahead of Friday, the first day for traders to post their intention to deliver physical silver against the May contract. `` The drop reflected the large deliveries expected,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. A large number of delivery notices would suggest that producers have adequate supplies of silver on hand. `` The downward pressure also tended to reflect the high warehouse stocks,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Gold prices fell in sympathy with silver and on signs of selling by gold dealers, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. `` There is a general feeling that if the economy is slowing down, metal finishing demand wo n't be there,'' he said. Gold settled $ 2.10 to $ 3.80 lower with June at $ 386.10 a troy ounce. Petroleum futures settled mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on position-evening ahead of the expiration Friday of the gasoline and heating-oil contracts. Traders also were nervous over the possibility that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members may increase their crude-oil production later this year. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 27 cents lower with June at $ 20.92 a barrel; heating oil was .33 cent to .88 cent higher with May at 51.86 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .06 cent to .60 cent lower with June at 72.27 cents a gallon. Hogs were up, pork bellies were down and cattle futures were narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The recent rise in pork-market volatility reflects conflicting views of whether cash prices for hogs have reached their normal seasonal bottom. The hog market tends to make a bottom in late April, then trend higher into the summer as the flow of hogs to slaughter slows. `` It has to do with the seasonality of the farrowing of pigs and the seasonality of when they come to market,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. He said cash hog prices have recently approached $ 40 per hundredweight, a signal that futures prices may be working higher, but `` it's a little bit premature to say it with any real conviction.'' Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .05 cent higher with May at 75.82 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent lower to .40 cent higher with June at 47.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 32.37 cents a pound. Corn futures prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of a major corn purchase by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the Soviets had purchased 150,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. Wheat futures prices dropped and soybean prices closed lower. Soybeans were under pressure throughout the day as word circulated that the Brazilian courts were set to rule on the legality of a dock strike that is holding up that country's soybean exports and could lead to increased global demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans. `` The thinking is that the court is going to be against the dockworkers and the army is going to be used to break up the strike if it continues,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Witter </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $ 4.05 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $ 2.68 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -RCB- cents to 6 cents lower with May at $ 1.77 \ a bushel; soybeans were 11 cents lower to 1 cent higher with May at $ 7.29 -LCB- a

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Continue To Climb</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline futures prices closed flat to lower in active trading Thursday, reversing the sharp runup of recent days. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the May contract for unleaded gasoline finished the day at 78.12 cents a gallon, unchanged from Wednesday. The last time gasoline closed higher was on Nov. 27, 1985, when it settled at 79 cents. Analysts said the weakness in gasoline was expected because current price levels are exaggerated and could not be sustained indefinitely. Gasoline futures have surged 65 percent since Jan. 1. Crude oil that is traded on the exchange was down across the board. The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil fell 27 cents to $ 20.92 a barrel. Other contract months lost as much as 19 cents. Heating oil for May delivery rose 0.88 cent to 51.86 cents a gallon. Other contract months also gained. May contracts for heating oil and gasoline are scheduled to expire on Friday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said softer gasoline prices were not a surprise. `` I do n't think the market can go straight up,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. `` In the last few days, people who were short took a beating.'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said the fall in crude prices probably pressured the gasoline market and reflected expectations of higher world production. `` There is a belief in the market that the Saudis are signaling a lifting of ceilings, making the market rethink its price levels,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. Consumer gasoline prices, which are usually more than 20 cents below wholesale prices, have surged in recent weeks, playing catchup to the sharp rise in crude prices since last December. Some analysts predict a further rise in retail gas prices but at a slower rate than in recent weeks as market conditions stabilize. Industry estimates put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production at about 2 million barrels a day higher than its self-imposed quota of 18.5 million barrels. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is the largest <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> producer and the world's largest exporter Analysts say excess production from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has offset much of the supply disruptions stemming from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill and last week's <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> gas explosion The main factor driving up gasoline prices in recent weeks are the new federal regulations scheduled to take effect this summer lowering the amount of lead content in gasoline. The higher octane formula requires the refining of more crude oil to make the new gasoline. Since demand is perceived to be rising while the capacity of the nation's refineries are thought to be declining, expectations of possible tight supplies of gasoline have sent wholesale prices soaring. But some observers believe that the current price rises are not warranted and that refiners and wholesalers raised their prices before a shortage or tightness actually occurred. A lot of oil and oil products are actually in storage, analysts said. `` Despite the unpredictable events over the last several months, we still do not see the fundamental support for recent price levels, and we still anticipate a correction,'' the petroleum consulting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Purvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly analysis. The Department of Energy recently made what analysts said was a substantial downward revision in its demand estimate for January. The DOE also lowered refinery output but raised inventory estimates to show a higher level than earlier recorded. Demand for February and March also are believed to be lower than earlier predicted. Despite lower refinery capacity, analysts say that detailed studies indicate that both volume and octane capabilities will be sufficient to meet demand.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped sharply on Thursday as a group led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> disclosed it has whittled its stake in the textbook publisher to 1.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it sold about 575,200 shares on Wednesday and Thursday at prices ranging from $ 42.02 to $ 43.46 a share, leaving it with 161,300 shares in the company. The group said it sold the stock because it appeared to be `` reasonably priced'' and added the group regards the company as `` one of the nation's leading publishers'' and said it is `` exceptionally well-managed.'' <PERSON> Houghton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mifflin </PERSON> had no comment on the move. `` They've made their comment,'' said <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, a vice president.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter profit more than doubled in the first quarter due in part to a sharp gain related to its 1988 legal settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For the three months ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said its net earnings rose to $ 52.5 million, or $ 1.34 a share, from $ 11.3 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same period a year ago Revenue rose to $ 673 million, from $ 485 million in the same 1988 period.

<HEAD>Unisys Chairman Puts Hopes In New Mainframe Computers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is poised to overcome a first-quarter loss sustained during delays in putting a new computer line on sale, Chairman <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said Thursday. Sales of the new 2200 series mainframe computers and expected gains in defense business _ despite tight military budgets and a procurement investigation _ should reassure shareholders, <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> recently reported it lost $ 78.7 million in the first quarter compared with net income of $ 149.3 million, or 72 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1988. `` This was essentially an anomaly,'' he told a news conference. `` These products are now reaching the marketplace, and therefore prospects are considerably brighter.'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' 1989 stockholders meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was formed when <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took over <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 4.8 billion deal in 1986. The company said orders for its 1100 series of mainframe computers had fallen off and customers were still waiting for shipments of the 2200 series introduced Feb. 21. Demand for mainframe computers has been flat, <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. `` But that's a problem the entire industry has faced,'' he said. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said companies may be holding off on major capital expenditures out of fears of inflation or an impending economic slowdown. The government's procurement investigation and the suspension of three former <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON> divisions from military contracts also hurt earnings, <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. Allegations of overcharges in 1983 in connection with a Sperry contract to upgrade the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide computer system led to a $ 700,000 cash settlement by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> in March and dismissal of the government's charges. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> incurred costs in cooperating with the investigation, `` and making sure these particular things can not happen within the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> organization.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> also hopes for gains, despite tight federal budgets, through government contracts that can help cut spending through efficient computer use. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> can get more business, he said, `` as the government looks for areas where it can reduce its costs, and our people are a way to do that.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s flagship <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> is moving steadily toward profitability, based on projections of increasing circulation and higher prices to third-party buyers such as hotels, company directors told shareholders Thursday The shareholder meeting marked the formal passing of the corporate baton from <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> and retiring chairman and chief executive officer, to successor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON>, who turned 65 last month, said he had been asked repeatedly during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention this week for his feelings about retirement. `` I'm ecstatic about it,'' he said. Then, taking note of the run-up in <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock in recent weeks, <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> added, `` If I had known that merely by retiring as chairman, the stock would climb by 15 percent over the last month, I would have done it earlier.'' The company is riding a streak of 86 consecutive quarters of record quarterly profits. Despite that performance, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> has lost about $ 600 million _ before taxes _ since its September 1982 debut, recording just two quarterly profits during that stretch. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, told shareholders he expected <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> to be profitable in both the second and fourth quarters of 1989. But he still predicted that `` for the full year, we should lose a little, especially if the economy weakens. ... The goal for 1990 is to open the window of profit.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said the newspaper's profitability would be bolstered by an increase in the price of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> to suppliers who give the newspapers away, with each increase of one cent worth about $ 4 million in revenues. He also said circulation had climbed by 8.2 percent in 1988 for the Friday-weekend edition and 6.1 percent for the remaining four weekdays. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, who is editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, said he hoped the meeting would end the `` dumb comparisons'' being made between <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, each of whom he lauded as the `` right man at the right time.'' And indeed, <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> proved just as adept at straight talk as <PERSON> Neuharth </PERSON> while presiding over his first annual meeting and the company's 22nd since going public. When Accuracy in Media's <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION> said that a survey of business executives revealed that most felt newspapers' coverage of business and businessmen was biased, <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> replied: `` A lot of them -LRB- businessmen -RRB- are used to adulatory business coverage by their own press departments and they may get a little rabbit-eared because they're used to hearing what fine fellows they are.''

<TEXT>
 A former `` superbroker'' for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> won a breach of contract and defamation suit against the securities firm on Thursday, but a jury awarded him only 18 cents in damages in a verdict that he nevertheless termed a moral victory. Former broker <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> had sought $ 16 million in damages, but the <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury also found that he owed the Wall Street firm money for two promissary notes, plus attorneys fees resulting from the legal battle, which reduced his award to just 18 cents if the verdict holds up. Winters' attorney said his client achieved a `` moral victory.'' `` PaineWebber ca n't treat people like this again,'' said attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` ... These jurors are now telling them they have to be ethical.'' <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> agreed he had secured a moral victory, but declined further comment. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spirer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s attorney said he considered PaineWebber the victor, in light of Winters' reduced damage award. He also said he would file motions to set aside the verdict and to reduce the damage award. The complicated case had been watched closely on Wall Street, because it is unusual for brokers to sue their former employers. The case began in 1982, when <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kuhn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION>, now <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to join <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. He and other new employees who produced more than $ 1 million in annual commissions were touted as `` superbrokers'' to potential <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> customers. When he joined the firm, <PERSON> Winters </PERSON> was given two, five-year promissary notes by <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> for $ 240,000 and $ 60,000, respectively. Both were secured by a $ 300,000 bonus Winters received from the company. On March 23, 1984, <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> fired Winters for alleged willful misconduct. Winters filed suit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and federal courts, claiming <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> had hired him only to steal his multimillion-dollar client base. <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> sued him in <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to collect on the promissary notes. The company also filed a $ 300,000 lien on Winters' <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> home. Winters attached several counterclaims, contending he had been defamed and seeking damages. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawsuits were put on hold pending the outcome of the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Spirer </PERSON> said Thursday's verdict also renders moot the pending lawsuit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court, although <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> refused to discuss the matter. The <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> jury decided Winters must repay the $ 300,000 for the two promissary notes, plus $ 140,000 in attorney fees, or a total of $ 440,000 to <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. The jury awarded Winters $ 140,000 in damages on his claim that <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> improperly took possession of Winters' personal files, preventing him from doing business and causing him damage and $ 300,000 on his claim that <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> made false and defamatory statements about Winters in a Wall Street publication. The jury also awarded Winters `` nominal damages'' on three other counterclaims against the firm, including his breach of contract complaint. Because the relationship between <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> and Winters occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the damages were based on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state law, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law, the jury could award only nominal damages _ or 6 cents per claim _ on the three claims after awarding Winters $ 140,000 on the other damage claim, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrigan </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>'s request that he direct the jury to reject all counterclaims.

 <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had completed the $ 455 million sale of two divisions to a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> executives and an investment bank. Sold were the <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division based in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and the Engineered Fabrics division based in <LOCATION> Rockmart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> acquired the units when it bought <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 The group was led by <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It offered $ 425 million on March 27 but had to raise its offer after a second, unidentified bidder emerged. The new offer is about $ 5 million more than the competing one, <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> said. The bids were evaluated by a group of outside directors and the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The sale helps <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> narrow down to its core business of high-tech electronics, particularly defense electronics, while raising money to pay off the debt from the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> purchase, <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division has about 1,540 employees and the Engineered Fabrics division has about 610. Their combined sales are about $ 300 million. <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> said they were profitable but required heavy investment. The $ 455 million purchase price is made up of $ 425 million in cash and $ 30 million in notes that are convertible into 15 percent of the stock in the buyout group, which is called <ORGANIZATION> Opus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, trying to get $ 7 billion in help this year, will receive a $ 250 million loan from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the bank announced Thursday. The loan is to be used for investment in the Mexican textiles, auto parts and flowers industries. It is to be repaid in 17 years, including five years of grace during which only interest will be due, at a variable rate now 7.65 percent a year. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the second largest debtor in the Third World with a debt of about $ 107 billion. It is looking for help to compensate for the billions it must pay out every year as interest and principal. Last Friday, it was announced that commercial banks were being asked to postpone until 1990 about $ 1.175 billion in payments of principal due this year. A committee representing the banks backed the request. Negotiations between the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government and the commercial banks on a broader financial package are continuing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s sister organization, reached an agreement with Mexican authorities that would provide $ 3.6 billion This is subject to approval by the 151 governments in the fund, some of which _ notably <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ have expressed doubts about how some of the money would be applied under the debt-relief proposal of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. A decision is expected at the end of May or early in June. Also under negotiation are three more loans from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> totaling $ 1.5 billion. The bank is the biggest source of aid loans to Third World countries.

<HEAD>Broad Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose n the week ended April 17, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,087.1 billion from $ 3,083.6 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,971.1 billion from $ 3,965.6 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 781.6 billion from $ 782.0 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,075.3 billion, a 1.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,945.7 billion, up 3.8 percent, while M1 fell 1.0 percent to an average of $ 785.6 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 476 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 997 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 288.4 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 288.0 billion two weeks earlier

 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say they were stunned when <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> pulled out of its promise to buy the company's footwear division, but an analyst says this gives other bidders a chance to make offers. The market apparently is looking at the failure of the proposed $ 422.5 million sale as bad news, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Advest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> securities firm in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION> stock fell $ 1 a share to $ 16.75 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. `` My personal opinion is that maybe it's not bad news,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. `` It means that somebody else might buy them. The stock has been as high as 27 and it's trading down near its low. It certainly would be a better buy down around where it is now.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION>, a Cincinnati-based shoe, apparel and eyewear company, said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> does not intend to consummate the previously announced agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and a group of management officials from the footwear division announced on Feb. 27 that they had agreed to buy the footwear group and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> headquarters building for $ 422.5 million in cash. The deal would have given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe the right to buy as much as 17.5 percent of the purchasing corporation's stock. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based buyout firm, decided that certain conditions and obligations of the purchase agreement had not been satisfied, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe said without elaborating. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe chairman and chief executive officer, said his company was surprised and disappointed. `` We disagree with their position and we believe that we have a binding agreement to sell our footwear division. We shall continue to explore our options with respect to the agreement,'' <PERSON> Barach </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe already conducted a thorough auction process for the division before reaching the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. Therefore, <PERSON> Barach </PERSON> said, `` We do not intend to seek out potential buyers and would rather operate this proven business.'' The collapse of the sale agreement means <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shoe </ORGANIZATION> will not increase its annual dividend from 46 cents to $ 1 per share, as previously had been announced. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camuto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said his company would be willing to pay more than the proposed $ 422.5 million sale price, but was refused the financial information he needed before making a bid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Shoe officials said they were afraid that a deal with <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Camuto </PERSON>, which is a shoe importer, would violate antitrust laws.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Announces Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will buy back up to 14.5 million shares of common stock in a $ 1 billion repurchase plan and sell its real-estate subsidiary, the company announced Thursday. `` These actions are designed to enhance shareholder value,'' chief executive officer <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said in a statement. But Standard and <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that the announcement had `` negative implications'' for the company's long-term debt, and it was placing the bond and commercial paper issues on CreditWatch. The Bethlehem-based holding company has about $ 2 billion in long-term debt, and its <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb.-based railroad subsidiary has $ 900 million, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> declined comment on the S & amp; P statement, issued after the stock markets closed Thursday. The company said its board of directors had authorized the buyback offer to begin Friday and expire at midnight May 25. The board also has authorized spending up to $ 528 million to buy back additional shares in open market or other transactions after the cash self-tender offer expires, the company said. Under the buyback plan, each of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 shareholders will be invited to name a price between $ 66 and $ 73 per share. The company will choose a price and buy up to 14.5 million shares tendered at or below that price. The offer is not conditioned on a minimum number of shares being tendered. Analysts said the move appeared to be aimed at increasing shareholder value, but disagreed on whether it might be a defensive move against a possible takeover attempt. `` Takeover targets in the past have certainly included companies with a diversified base,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who added he knew of no potential suitors. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiaries include a major Western railroad, trucking, real estate, natural resources and hazardous waste disposal. `` I do n't think it's a major takeover target,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, transportation analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Union Pacific had been trying to build its stock price in part because of an incentive plan for top executives, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION>, has been based in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, but is scheduled to move to new headquarters in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> by June 1, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said.

 State Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> late Thursday blocked oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 2.7 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The suspension order blocks the estimated 1,900 shareholders in the state from selling their 1.3 million shares to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> the option of asking for another hearing on the issue, which would have been held Thursday night, but <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not request one by the 5 p.m. deadline, according to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotenberg </PERSON>, a spokesperson for the commissioner. In a related development Thursday, key legislators' questions about the constitutionality of a proposed anti-takeover bill aimed at placing roadblocks in the way of suitors for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> delayed a vote on the measure by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said a management-led buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> is not in the works, but there are as many as four friendly suitors interested in buying the airline `` There are a couple of friendly investors out there who could do something significant for our shareholders,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said at his first news conference since the carrier became the target of a hostile $ 2.7 billion takeover bid by oil mogul <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` There are two very strong, friendly indications.'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> would not identify the suitors, but said he considers a previously identified group led by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> to be a potential `` white knight.'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s group, which includes former <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, holds a 4.9 percent stake in the company. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive and <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> is a friend of <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON>, the company's chairman, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncaster </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shares jumped $ 2.37 -LCB- a share to $ 102.37 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, remaining above <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 90-a-share buyout proposal. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said management is not pursuing a leveraged buyout and has not hired an adviser to explore one, although such a transaction has not be ruled out. In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. Ten to 15 groups have shown interest in buying or investing in the airline and the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board has said it would consider all serious offers. Non-public information about the airline will be available beginning next week to groups who have signed a confidentiality agreement. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said the board would like to make a final decision as soon as possible. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> repeated an earlier statement that a successful deal with friendly suitors was contingent on a closed contract with the airline's 5,000 pilots. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has urged the pilots to expedite negotiations, but union negotiators have declined. `` An open contract is an invitation to hostile money,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said. If a hostile bidder acquires the airline and opens negotiations with the pilots, the next offer `` will look like a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> contract or a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> contract,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said. Pilots at those two carriers had to accept concessionary contracts after the airlines were acquired. If the pilots reject such an offer and strike, the new management would be inclined to say, `` Fine. I liquidate,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the statements by <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> were intended to pressure the pilots into concessions. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has launched a proxy fight to unseat the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board at its May 15 annual meeting, but <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> discounted <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' chances of winning. `` Based on the proposal he has out there today, I do n't think he's got a lot of influence in the shareholder vote,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said. The $ 90 a share Davis offer, which includes less than 10 percent equity, would hurt the carrier by loading it with debt, <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said. He also disagreed with <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' contentions that he could operate the airline profitably with the minimal changes he has proposed _ especially in an economic downturn. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> also said the value of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> real estate has been exaggerated. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has said he would consider refinancing or selling the real estate, which analysts have said could bring up to $ 500 million. But <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said the Japanese government could slap a tax of up to 70 percent on the sale and must approve the sale price.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to make savings and loan owners put nearly $ 13 billion more of their own money at risk as the price for a $ 90 billion federal bailout but gave them 3 -LCB- more years than President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to do it. Eleven Republicans joined all but four Democrats in a 36-15 vote to delay until January 1995 the June 1991 deadline that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed for S & amp; Ls to come up with 3 percent `` hard cash'' capital _ or $ 3 for every $ 100 they lend. `` Without real capital _ hard capital _ the taxpayers have no protection'' from further raids on federal deposit insurance funds by imprudent S & amp; L operators, said the committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Action on several weakening amendments was postponed until next week. Nonetheless, administration officials hailed Thursday's vote _ which doubles the capital requirements of a bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week _ a major victory for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. `` Requiring S & amp; Ls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the taxpayers' money is the only way to prevent in the future the unsound business practices that contributed to the current crisis,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> told reporters afterward that the panel's recognition of the need for a 3 percent layer of protection between S & amp; L loans that could go sour and federal insurance funds was more important than the timetable for achieving it. `` We're happy to have that number up on the board now,'' he said. The committee later weakened the requirement slightly on a 26-24 vote on an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., that would allow <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to continue counting as capital their past direct investments in subsidiaries engaged in real estate, insurance or other businesses But under the amendment, double leveraging of those investments _ in what <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> described as effectively a pyramid scheme _ to support massive quantities of new lending would no longer be allowed. Such direct investments by S & amp; Ls using little or none of their own hard cash capital to support skyrocketing loan growth rates _ particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ have been blamed as a major contributor to the thrift crisis. Through such schemes, the administration and others have argued, a portion of the industry was able to lend hundreds of billions of federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent real estate and other ventures. Including interest, the taxpayer cost of backing up the federal insurance guarantees to depositors whose money was lost is expected to be well over $ 200 billion over the next 30 years under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bailout plan Opponents of the plan said many of the nation's thrifts would be forced out of business or into mergers by rapidly imposing stricter capital standards. That, they argue, would require another taxpayer bailout in the near future. `` If we force institutions by definition ... to double their capital in two years, ... then it will not be the private sector that puts it in; it may well be the government who puts it in,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiler </PERSON>, R-Ind. Throgh an amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., the committee adopted a new capital requirement that the administration has been pushing since late last week Effectively, it would require S & amp; L owners to show by 1995 that they have $ 3 of `` tangible'' capital in the form of cash or stock of their own at risk for every $ 100 they lend. Otherwise, they would be put under a broad measure of government controls. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s amendment slightly altered an administration-endorsed version by <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the committee's ranking Republican. It would have required $ 2.25 in capital for each $ 100 of loans on an S & amp; L's books, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s June 1991 deadline. The new version would give S & amp; L owners an additional 19 months to reach the $ 2.25 plateau. It would also extend until January 1995 the required `` tangible'' capital level asked by the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>. The administration had praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action last week to require S & amp; L owners to put up $ 1.50 in capital for each $ 100 in loans they write. But it also immediately sought more in the form of an amendment to the House version, vowing to `` take the case to the taxpayers'' if its new demand was not met. Opponents, however, said the new infusions of cash investments being demanded as a layer of protection between S & amp; L lending practices and the government's deposit insurance funds would drive 600 to 700 moderately healthy thrifts out of business. `` Our choice is simple,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` Do we save the S & amp; L industry ... for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who want a home ... or do we sell it out. But Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., countered that any institution that can not raise its level of capital to $ 2.25 for every $ 100 in loans on their books `` should not be in the business. `` If we do n't strengthen the capital requirement, this is going to be a real wimpout,'' he told his colleagues. `` In fact the definition of a wimp is going to become someone who serves on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> was the primary author of an amendment approved two weeks ago that would require thrift owners within a year to show they have $ 1.50 in `` tangible'' capital such as cash or stock easily convertible to cash for every $ 100 they lend. While that has been characterized as both toughening and weakening <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original proposal, the same figure was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but with fewer accounting loopholes that would prevent federal regulators from recovering all that amount in the event of an <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L's failure. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> likened `` good will'' exemptions from hard cash, stock or other equity capital requirements that the government has granted S & amp; Ls over the last eight years to `` a soft ice-cream cone in the July sun.'' `` Good will provides nothing if the institution goes down,'' he said. `` This entire exercise is a sham unless we change the way the savings and loans operate. We can not in good conscience require the taxpayers to pay out billions of dollars and at the same time tell them they must bear all the future risks.'' <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had told him Thursday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will take their case to the taxpayers prior to a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor'' if the amendment was not adopted. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, some 2,586 of the remaining thrifts nationwide have some form of cash or tangible net worth that could be tapped before government insurance funds were needed if there was a run on deposits. But 323 of them with outstanding loans of more than $ 400 billion have below the 1.5 percent, or $ 1.50, standard and another 478 are now below the 2.25 percent, or $ 2.25, tangible capital level, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's biggest trade organization. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Grohl </PERSON>, a league vice president, said the $ 1.50 capital requirement would force the 323 solvent thrifts now below that standard to come up with a total of $ 9.2 billion in new capital. The $ 2.25 standard, he said, would require the 801 institutions with less than that now to raise a total of $ 12.8 billion over the next two years. `` The solvent institutions earned only $ 3.4 billion last year,'' he said. `` Since 1980 and during some pretty good times, the industry has been able to raise only $ 20 billion in new capital. A lot of them just are n't going to make it.''

<HEAD>Delta Earnings Soar, UAL's Fall in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS lead, ADDS 3 grafs to UPDATE with USAir earnings and
to CLARIFY that UAL was profitable on a continuing-operations basis.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

 First-quarter profits surged at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, while the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter profit on continuing operations also increased. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said its strong first quarter was only partially a result of the strike that virtually grounded rival <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said good economic conditions, continuing benefits from a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and growth in domestic and international operations also contributed to the increase. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said earnings for the first quarter jumped to $ 85 million, or $ 1.73 a share, from $ 56.1 million, or $ 1.15 a share, in the same period of 1988. First-quarter revenue rose 19 percent to $ 2.04 billion. `` The key to the increased earnings was the 20 percent growth in passenger revenues,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeck </PERSON>, senior vice president for finance and chief financial officer of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. `` The strike against a major competitor during the month of March resulted in increased revenue passenger miles,'' he said, `` but traffic growth was strong in January and February prior to the strike, and in many markets not affected by the strike.'' He said passenger traffic increased 13 percent in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, one of the areas most affected by the Eastern strike. `` Yet traffic for the first three months of the year was up 8 percent in <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, 37 percent in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, 15 percent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and 10 percent in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ all markets where Eastern is not a competitor,'' <PERSON> Roeck </PERSON> said. For the nine months ended March 31, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 270.1 million, or $ 5.49 a share, an increase of 33 percent over the same period in the previous year. Nine-month revenue rose to $ 5.78 billion from $ 5.04 billion a year earlier. At Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, profit for the first quarter was down sharply due to a one-time after-tax gain of $ 548 million in last year's first quarter from the sale of its Westin hotel unit. Profit for the first quarter totaled $ 65.4 million, or $ 3.03 per share, down from $ 576.9 million, or $ 12.02 per share, in 1988's first quarter But comparing continuing operations, mainly the airline, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose sharply in the first quarter to $ 65.4 million compared with the year-ago profit of $ 27.9 million The per-share earnings are not comparable because the average number of common shares outstanding used in calculating the 1989 figure was 21.6 million, compared with 47.9 million for the first quarter of 1988. The difference is due to <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of 35.5 million shares of its common stock in March 1988. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $ 2.3 billion, up from $ 2.06 billion in the 1988 quarter. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> said passenger miles on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> planes were up only slightly but the company's yield per passenger increased 18 percent, largely because of higher air fares. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 15.5 million, or 35 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $ 18.8 million a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> had revenues of $ 1.48 billion, up 18 percent from $ 1.25 billion a year earlier. Traffic on <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> was up 34 percent in the period and 8 percent on <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, which is also owned by the <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based airline holding company.
