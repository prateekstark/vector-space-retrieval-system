<HEAD>Soviet Emigree Accused Of Being Moscow Spy Goes On Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Soviet emigrant with links to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politicians and military officers went on trial Monday insisting his confession of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was obtained under duress, his lawyer said. <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>, 43, was taken into the closed courtroom under heavy guard. He stopped briefly to embrace his father and wife who handed him newspapers, cigarettes and a sack of cheese and lettuce sandwichs. Attorney <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zichroni </PERSON> said his client took extensive notes during the five-hour hearing. He said only one witness testified Monday, an agent of <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service, who helped obtain <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>'s confession during his eight months in custody. `` We are arguing that this confession was not made voluntarily,'' <PERSON> Zichroni </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am not permitted ... to give details, but I can say we oppose its submission.'' The exact charges <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON> faces have not been revealed. He is expected to plead innocent after the hearing resumes Thursday. <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>, who emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1971, was arrested in December. He had established himself in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as an international businessman, an activist in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a socialite who mixed with leading politicians and senior army officers. <PERSON> Zichroni </PERSON> declined to comment on foreign reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be working on a deal to trade <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON> in a spy swap involving <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, an American convicted of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and another unidentified American. <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON> wore sneakers and was dressed neatly Monday but had long hair. `` The security men do n't take me to the barber,'' he told reporters.

<TEXT>
 A fire Monday near an aquatic park that boasts `` five million gallons'' burned about 10 acres of brush before it was extinguished, and destroyed eight cars, authorities said. Firefighters had some difficulty in controlling the fire at first because `` there's no fire hydrant in the parking lot. We ca n't get any water to the cars,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire Inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> said. County fire Capt. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Oversby </PERSON> said later that water was rerouted from hydrants nearby. It was not immediately known whether the blaze began in a vehicle or on the vegetation in <LOCATION> Bonnelli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, but the flames leaped from car to car, <PERSON> Oversby </PERSON> said. The fire was reported shortly after 2 p.m. in an overflow parking area for Raging Waters amusement park less than one mile away. The park was not evacuated and no one was injured. `` Raging Waters is 44 acres, five million gallons and tons of fun for everyone,'' said a tape-recorded message at the park, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The park features 12 water slides, a fresh-water surf pool, and a river-rafting ride. Damage was estimated at $ 50,000, Oversby said.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top military official, speaking to reporters Tuesday before meeting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is not a major arms dealer. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a developing country. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can only sell a little. It is only a small fraction of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sold,'' Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s sales of missiles to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> nations, including Silkworm missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, have been criticized by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sold about $ 2 billion worth of arms last year, mainly to developing countries. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not provide information on its arms sales. <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other Third World countries sell only conventional arms `` but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is selling advanced arms such as the F-16'' jet fighter. `` We ca n't compare the two kinds of arms,'' he said. Deputy Chief of Staff <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, also talking to reporters in the Great Hall of the People, insisted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> strictly regulates its arms sales. `` First, they are for defense. Second, they are for maintaining stability and peace, not war,'' he said. Earlier Tuesday the American national anthem echoed off the gray walls of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top military leaders welcomed <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> on his first official visit. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, accompanied by <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, reviewed a 120-member honor guard from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> arrived Monday for a five-day visit to discuss international and bilateral issues. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is expected to call on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remove restrictions on technology transfers and approve export licenses for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies wanting to use Chinese Long March missiles to launch satellites. Use of the Chinese missiles has been opposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense officials concerned about giving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite technology. Regional conflicts in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the Soviet military stance in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are also likely to be discussed.

 Fifty people were arrested Monday when a group trying to distribute free food and leaflets scuffled with police, who had previously warned the group to get a permit or move elsewhere. A television cameraman was injured when a police officer knocked him to the ground at the fracas on the edge of Golden Gate Park. Food and fists went flying when a squad of police officers wearing riot gear closed in on about 200 people gathered for the `` Food Not Bombs'' give-away. It was the second time in a week the group had clashed with police. On Aug. 29, 29 people were arrested in a similar confrontation. Group leaders said they will return each Monday. Later Monday in <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, a group active on behalf of the homeless, the <ORGANIZATION> Gandhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, gave its annual <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> Award for Community Consciousness to the city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to recognize the arrests. The tongue-in-cheek award refers to the French queen's famous remark of, `` Let them eat cake,'' when told the peasants were without bread. The latest confrontation took place about 45 minutes after the group marched into the southeast corner of the park, adjacent to the <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION> district, popular in the 1960s among hippies and in the'80s among people who buy and restore Victorian homes. Police moved in as the group's members began giving food to one another. Police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said it was considered an illegal give-away after food was given to 25 people. As the officers approached, food began to fly through the air. One officer was hit in the face with a plate of rice and another was struck in the neck with a tomato. A police officer grabbed <ORGANIZATION> KPIX </ORGANIZATION> cameraman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoepp </PERSON>, knocking him to the ground. The cameraman lay stunned for a few moments with blood trickling from his cheek and his camera tossed aside. He then got up and resumed filming the clash. Some of those arrested were dragged away with their wrists bound by plastic ties. They were loaded into police vans and taken away. <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said they faced a possible misdemeanor count of creating a nuisance and two park infractions: illegal distribution of food and illegal leafleting. The park infractions carry a maximum penalty of a $ 50 fine. <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said one woman also faced a charge of assaulting an officer. <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said the giveaway would not be illegal if the group had obtained permits. He said the group had been offered other sites for the give-away, but rejected that idea. The group had 15 to 20 cartons of food, including bread, carrots, lettuce, rice, melons and corn. The leaflets said the group had been harassed in recent months by police and had been unfairly characterized by Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> as being interested in exploiting the homeless and hungry. <PERSON> Patrisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestey </PERSON>, who was handing out deviled eggs, said she was a legal assistant in a law office and lived in the neighborhood. `` I disapproved of what the police are doing. I think the poor should be taken care of,'' she said. It was not clear if she was a member of the group. <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rorke </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Stanyan-Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm against this particular give-away in this particular location. `` I also feel that they are not so interested in giving away food as they are in promoting their particular message,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Rorke </PERSON>, whose organization is one of several neighborhood associations opposed to the `` Food Not Bombs'' give-aways. `` It's a free country, and if they want to have their political views, they can have them. I just do n't like their means of using the hungry and blocking the entrance to the park,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Republicans, with a good shot at gaining a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat two years after losing one, will be choosing between the arch-conservative grandson of a baseball legend and the brash prosecutor who put a Colombian drug lord behind bars. Meantime, six Democrats are battling in their primary, prompted by the decision of the popular incumbent, <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, not to seek re-election. An October runoff will be necessary if, as expected, no one gets more than half the votes on Tuesday. Seven of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>' 19 congressional districts are also holding primaries. Raising funds has been the dominant topic of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races, two years after then-Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> unseated Republican Sen. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> in a race that cost them a combined $ 13 million. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stunned state politicians with his decision in December not to seek a fourth term. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said he was burned out by his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> workload and the high cost of campaigns. Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a three-term Republican, had already begun piling up funds when <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> dropped out. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, whose late grandfather managed the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> A's and is in Baseball's Hall of Fame, has spent at least $ 2.2 million so far. Democrats were pleased when former Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> announced his candidacy. But <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, though running well ahead of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> in the polls, abruptly quit May 7, saying he did n't like all the time spent raising funds. <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>'s withdrawal left Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> the only Democrat to oppose <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. But quickly, five others entered the race: three-term state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, state Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, former Republican Gov. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> postal clerk <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> got a surprise of his own when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, fresh from gaining the conviction of Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, quit as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and entered the Republican race in June. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> made campaign appearances for <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a 47-year-old with one of the most conservative records in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The outspoken <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, also a conservative, has likened <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> to a `` shiny new car'' with `` no engine under the hood.'' When <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> refused to debate him, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> started carrying around a life-sized replica of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> he called `` Cardboard Connie.'' However, he did not make an issue of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s admission last year that he had used marijuana in his younger days. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, 43, has spent only about $ 100,000 but has garnered more newspaper endorsements that credit him with more specific stands on issues than <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. Still, published polls make <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> the heavy favorite to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, and his well-financed campaign and the divided campaign on the Democratic side give him a good chance of prevailing in November. `` I do n't think it'll be an easy race, but I think it's winnable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> In the Democratic primary, polls give <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> the lead with about 40 percent of the vote. A candidate needs to top 50 percent to avert a runoff Oct. 4. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, who lost to Mrs. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> in 1980, raised $ 1 million within six weeks of entering the race, and opponents noted he took at least $ 160,000 from the insurance industry he regulates as state insurance commissioner. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s department `` a saga of sleaze.'' Polls indicated the race for second was too close to call between MacKay, a three-term congressman, and <PERSON> Mica </PERSON>, a five-term congressman. In the congressional races, 10th-term Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, touched by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal, faced a little-known engineer in the Democratic primary, while three Republicans are vying for the chance to challenge him. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> has denied wrongdoing, although his name has been mentioned repeatedly during the probe. Six Republicans are battling to succeed <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. Former Rep. <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Bafalis </PERSON>, who gave up the seat in an unsuccessful run for governor in 1982, was expected to be in a runoff with former <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goss </PERSON> or retired Army Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozier </PERSON>, who was held hostage by terrorists in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> scanned the target and flung the plane in a stomach-wrenching attack dive into the rocky valley below. The small <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> OV-10 Bronco nose-dived, the force of the acceleration forcing its two occupants back against their armor-plated seats. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> flashed past as <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> streaked toward the target, calmly checking the attack coordinates. White phosphorous rockets flashed from the plane's belly and slammed into the practice target as the pilot jerked the plane up over a rock cliff. <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> glanced back to check his handiwork. `` We do everything as if it were Day One of a war, except nobody shoots at us,'' <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> explained after Thursday's flight. `` You really have a sense of urgency and mission in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are on increased alert in case communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> makes any attempt to disrupt the Olympic Games, which begin Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is helping guarantee the security of the Olympics. <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> and other pilots of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s 19th <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> serve as forward air controllers whose mission is to spot and mark targets with smoke for other planes to attack. Their small planes also fly attack missions against ground targets. `` We control violence,'' is the motto worn by members of the squadron based at <ORGANIZATION> Osan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of troops, including 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, face each other in a tense confrontation on the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have been based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervened to help the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded in 1950 to begin the Korean War. An armistice was signed in 1953, but the north and south technically are still at war. Col. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> threat is a daily fact of life. `` I think the threat presented by the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> is real. They are not what could be classified as rational actors,'' he said. South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commanders fear <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will attempt to disrupt the Olympics because its demand to be a co-host of the Games has been rejected. The North has a long history of launching terrorist attacks against the South. `` The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> would like to see an embarrassment to the Republic of -LRB- South -RRB- <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops wo n't be guarding Olympic venues, but the Games have increased the sense of tension and spurred greater vigilance, <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` Everyone's adrenalin goes up. Everyone leans forward in their foxholes,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. Airspace over <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and all Olympic sites has been declared off-limits during the Games. South Korean military air controllers quickly challenge any approaching plane. `` If you get real close to the capital area they threaten to shoot you down,'' <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> said after being challenged by an air controller over the radio. <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON>, who has been stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for three years, said training is intense because hostile forces are poised just a few miles away. Pilots carry war plans on all missions. `` We're ready to go to work at a moment's notice,'' he said. Flying over Nightmare Range about 15 miles from the border, <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> pointed out a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> military air base visible across the border. `` The North Korean MiGs can be on us in two minutes,'' he said. <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> said he has not seen a North Korean jet during his tour of duty in the South, but he and other pilots often hear the north's military radio traffic while they are flying. The airwaves along the border constantly crackle with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military air controllers giving instructions. The area routinely is busy with warplanes on patrol or practicing. South Koreans have to live with a constant military presence and frequent exercises that can be disruptive, but they accept the inconveniences as unavoidable, <PERSON> Vandervalk </PERSON> said. `` It shows how lucky people in the West are,'' he said. `` When was the last time an American had a tank roll through his garden?''

 When three <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> members were gunned down in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on March 6 while allegedly plotting a car bombing, the British government claimed a victory on the battlefield of terrorism. Instead it got a political controversy that is still simmering six months later. A long-awaited inquest into the killings opens Tuesday in the British colony on the southeast tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> MacCann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> were unarmed when they died. The car bomb, much to the British government's embarrassment, never materialized, although the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> admitted the three were on a guerrilla mission and a car full of explosives was found 40 miles from the scene two days later Moreover, two British television networks investigating what had happened that sunny Sunday in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> found witnesses whose accounts strongly suggested the three were shot without being given any chance to surrender. It all boiled down to a simple question that confronts every democracy facing a terrorist threat: Did <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> bend the rule of law? Critics like <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the human rights watchdog, which demanded an inquiry into the shootings in hopes of answering that question, were rebuffed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who said she was outraged that the question was even being asked. As far as the government was concerned, a disaster was averted. It argued that there was no way of knowing on that day that no car bomb was in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>; that it had to be assumed a bomb was set to blow up a military parade and hordes of onlookers; that there was no certainty the perpetrators were not armed and did not have remote-control detonators to explode the bomb the moment they were told to surrender. The government sought to dissuade <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from broadcasting the documentaries, arguing that `` trial by TV'' would prejudice the inquest. The broadcasts went ahead, confronting viewers with some chilling accounts from witnesses. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, a lawyer, told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> he `` saw a chap with a white shirt reeling backward, with a man standing four feet away from him, firing a gun constantly and following him down as he fell.'' He said: `` It was n't a question of just putting one or two shots into him just to stop him. It seemed to me this was a deliberate shooting to kill, no question.'' The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> also quoted an unidentified witness who saw <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> on his back, with another man standing over him with his foot on his chest. `` I heard no warning before the shots were fired,'' she was quoted as saying. `` He continued to fire shots into the man as he lay on the ground.'' <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Proetta </PERSON>, watching from her apartment, said she believed <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> had their hands up in surrender when they were shot dead by a man who `` went into a crouch position and took deliberate aim at them.'' The issues have been debated since 1982, when police in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> killed five unarmed suspects and an innocent youth in three separate incidents. The arguments arose anew after three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> men were gunned down in a British army ambush in the west of the province last Tuesday. Defending the government in the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> after the TV documentaries, Lord <PERSON> Chalfont </PERSON> denounced any `` equivalence between indiscriminate killing in the course of political terrorism, and the killing of terrorists by security forces engaged in counterterrorist operations.'' The liberal Guardian, on the other hand, maintained: `` A state that turns to terror itself in desperate recourse'' in the end endorses values of terrorists. Tuesday's inquest, which was postponed from June, is now the focus of attention. Sixty-five witnesses have been called, and <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> is in a state of high alert, wracked by frequent bomb scares. The seven operatives involved in the March 6 incident are thought to belong to the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a top-secret anti-terrorist team, and they will testify behind a screen to prevent their being marked for reprisals. But the British government has reserved the right to keep them away from the inquest. If the 11-member jury returns a verdict of unlawful killings, Attorney General <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Thistlethwaite </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> will prosecute the perpetrators, according to high-level sources in the colony who requested anonymity. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> fired warning shots at a cocaine-laden freighter heading into St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and arrested five crewmen who said they were Colombian nationals, a spokesman said Sunday night.

<HEAD>Town Seeks Recourse To Missing River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAYVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When a town loses a river, the situation can become explosive. It has for <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>, a town of about 2,300 that, until 1985, sat on the banks of the <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The town did n't move; the river did, and now, after three years of waiting for federal agencies or floods to return the river to its `` rightful'' course, some frustrated residents are threatening to use dynamite. `` If Mother Nature does n't do it, man will,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, who owns the Hard Times fish market in this southeastern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town. If <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>'s economic situation were better, residents might be more tolerant of the river's shift. Several years ago, <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON> was a thriving oil producer, but about the time the river changed course, cheaper imports glutted the market. And because this year's drought dried up anticipated agricultural income, the stagnant channel has become an unpleasant reminder of hard times. Before the river changed course, hundreds of fishermen used to crowd <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>'s restaurants, bars and gas stations every weekend. The money they spent once would have buffered losses from oil and agriculture. But now, like the <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION>, the anglers do n't come around anymore. When spring floods receded in 1985, residents discovered the river had left them. A new channel had cut off the horseshoe bend upon which <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON> was founded. These days, fishermen are lucky to get a flat-bottomed boat in the shallow waters of the old channel. And they'd better be prepared to row, because a motor will strike bottom, residents say. Water that used to flow at 40 feet per second now does n't move at all. Silt that once was washed downstream is now filling in the old channel, and tall weeds have taken over the sand bars that boaters and swimmers once flocked to. <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>'s boat ramp is usually empty. For three years, residents pleaded with federal and state officials for money to bring the rambling river home. Federal agencies came up with a package that would cost the town $ 900,000, a quarter of the cost to build a dam to divert the <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> back. `` There's no way the town could come up with $ 900,000,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON>, noting that the town's entire annual budget is barely over $ 1 million. Talk at <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>'s barbershop and other hangouts has focused on residents taking care of the problem themselves. A recent editorial in The Mercury Independent, <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>'s hometown newspaper, criticized the lack of help from authorities and reported `` growing sentiment among <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON> citizens to take matters into their own hands `` The editorial refers to a rumored plan to dynamite a trench to relocate the river, but adds, `` We have no idea this will actually be carried out `` `` It's talk,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON>, who runs the <LOCATION> Grayville </LOCATION> sewage plant. `` No one's got the courage to do it. Vandalism like that is unheard of in <LOCATION> Grayville </LOCATION>.'' He hates to see <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON> lose its source of pride. Some of the town's most exciting history is tied to the river. A paddlewheeler once sank there, and a train trestle collapsed into the river when the town was young. Labor Day crowds will pack <PERSON> Grayville </PERSON>, but they're coming for the town's annual holiday celebration, not to fish or swim in the <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION>. Most of them will drive by the sign that welcomes visitors to `` <LOCATION> Grayville </LOCATION> _ On the Banks of the Wabash.'' `` I would start looking for another monument to the town,'' <PERSON> Ritchey </PERSON> said.

 Evidence of the pugnacious politics of Teamsters Local 560 can be seen in the graffiti spray-painted on the concrete base of the <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Skyway </LOCATION>'s hulking black girders. `` Remember Castellito,'' exhorts a scrawl, referring to <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellito </PERSON>, a Local 560 official slain in 1961. Reputed Genovese crime family figure <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Tony Pro'' <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> and his brothers <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunzio </PERSON> ran the Union City-based local until 1979, when <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> was convicted of racketeering and ordering Castellito's killing. In 1984, a federal judge removed 560's executive board and placed the local under a trustee to end a quarter-century of organized crime domination. It was the first such action in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. This Labor Day finds Local 560 in its 26th month under the trustee, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>. But the trusteeship is scheduled to end Dec. 6, the date <PERSON> Stier </PERSON> set for 560's first contested election since 1965, the last year anyone ran against the <ORGANIZATION> Provenzanos </ORGANIZATION>. `` What's happening here is exactly what we wanted,'' said <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>. `` The candidates are going to each barn and campaigning in an open election.'' But in the barns, as the sprawling truck depots are known, the trusteeship has not pleased many members. Some at first welcomed the efforts to exorcise corruption but grew wary when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> recently sued to place a trusteeship over the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are keeping a sharp eye on events over the river,'' said a federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` A smooth transition back to union control of the local could mean a lot to our case against the international.'' Three men are running for president of the 8,000-member local, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' largest: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for Liberty, who served on the ousted board; <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Viggiani </PERSON>, a Local 560 business agent and head of <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for Solidarity; and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, a trucker who ran against <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> in 1965 and leader of The Committee for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ticket </ORGANIZATION>. The government had sought to bar <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> from running, saying the local would again be dominated by organized crime under his leadership. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> is expected to rule soon on the government motion. After <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ordered the ouster of the local's leadership, <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> served as interim president for two years until June 1986, when appeals were exhausted. The goverment's case against <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> rests partly on secretly recorded tapes of conversations. The tapes, made public during hearings, allegedly depict <ORGANIZATION> Genovese </ORGANIZATION> captain <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> `` Matty the Horse'' Ianiello telling a former Local 560 official that <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> should `` take over'' the union after the trusteeship. <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> has denied any link to organized crime or any intention to take orders from anyone once elected. Though he declined to be interviewed, he authorized union member and friend <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> to speak for him. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> said the tape transcripts are unclear about the subject being discussed and who is speaking. `` Apparently from what we read of the transcripts there is the indication that the things being said there were completely contrary to some of the things the government is trying to prove,'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> said. Whether or not the 55-year-old <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> is permitted to run, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for Liberty will have a candidate. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> has been president before and he's qualified to step right into that job,'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> said. `` Members may not realize that this is n't a personality contest. This is about bread and butter and about the pension and welfare fund, which is now about $ 230 million.'' <PERSON> Stier </PERSON>, who has taken no official position on <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON>'s participation, agrees <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> is probably the front-runner, but that <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> has made inroads <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON>'s two opponents, concerned about the possible backlash that barring <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> could create, say they would like him to run. <PERSON> Viggiani </PERSON>, 48, said he believes the intimidation of the <PERSON> Provenzano </PERSON> years still remains, though more subtle. `` There are still members concerned with reprisals who are not openly supportive of an opposing ticket,'' he said. <PERSON> Stier </PERSON> said that intimidation has been `` only minor at this point.'' Members `` understand if that starts to develop, it could seriously hurt the chances for an election,'' he said. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, 58, admits that <PERSON> Sciarra </PERSON> has more experience because of his 14 years in union office. `` But that's why we're where we are today,'' he said. `` I'm a truck driver and I want to give this union back to the members. They should have a voice and know where their money is going.''

<HEAD>50-State Survey Shows Dukakis, Bush Neck-and-Neck</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are locked in an extremely tight race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as the fall campaign opens, with the vice president hoping to sustain his late summer surge and his Democratic rival angling to regain the momentum, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of the 50 states. Advisers to both men as well as politicians around the country say they expect a close race right up to Election Day on November 8. `` It's going to be down and dirty to the very end,'' said Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> _ a key battleground where Republicans concede that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> maintains a slight edge. In <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, `` as in the rest of the country, there's been a substantial shift in the last three weeks from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said the state's GOP Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>. `` I think it started at the -LRB- Republican National -RRB- Convention, as to be expected. But since the convention, it's continued, even with the problems surrounding the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> candidacy.'' The late-summer surge by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> eroded <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' earlier advantages in key <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> battlegrounds from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in between, say leaders in both political parties. The result is a series of tight, big-states races whose outcome will likely determine <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor in the White House. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his vice presidential running mate transformed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s adopted home state and its 29 electoral votes into an instant toss-up. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has countered elsewhere: the vice president seemingly has moved ahead in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with 21 electoral votes, as well as making up ground in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. One poll in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> even rated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state a toss-up, though the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey still found the state to be solid ground for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In small states and large, politicians report a close contest that is unlikely to be decided until the final few days. Campaign debates and unexpected international events could have a dramatic influence on the outcome. `` I'd say right now it's a flip of the coin,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, reflecting the sentiment of party professionals around the country. `` It could go either way.'' Senior officials of the two campaigns pronounce themselves pleased with the shape of the race. Said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager, `` Nationally, we're competitive. States will go up and down. It's exactly where we thought it would be. ... This is a very evenly matched contest.'' `` We all felt like we'd be lucky if we were in the single digits, meaning seven, eight, or nine points'' behind by Labor Day, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager. Officials in both camps agree that the race is subject to sharp swings, especially since neither candidate is an incumbent. That heightens the importance of debates, the subject of negotiations between the two campaigns with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seeking more and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> less. It also could heighten the effect of any mistakes by either of the candidates or their running mates, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a senior aide in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp, says the race shapes up this way: `` Basically you've got a tight race with the South looking pretty much <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s way. The West with the exception of the Coast -LRB- <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- is heading our way, but ca n't be taken for granted.'' Bond estimated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heads into the race armed with a solid 150 to 200 electoral votes, principally from Southern and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> probably can count on a base of 150 electoral votes, largely from the Northeast. Democrats believe they can win electoral votes from each region of the country, and note that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s addition to the ticket makes <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its 29 electoral votes an extremely competitive race. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON> puts each candidate's reliable base at closer to 100 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes. Even so, recent opinion polls indicate a dwindling advantage for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in states he has long counted in his column, including <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who is in charge of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' field organization, said the Democratic goal is to keep the race competitive in 45 or 46 states so that if the Republicans `` have a bad week they can lose'' in any of them. `` And I think we can keep it that close,'' he said. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and Republicans have won four of the last five elections with solid southern and western support. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a southerner, is the only Democrat to break the Republican string of victories in the last 20 years. With nine weeks until Election Day, these are some straws in the wind: _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the biggest state with 47 electoral votes, is viewed by both sides as a toss-up with a slight, initial edge to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> The state was a tie in one recent poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led in one recent poll in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was a tie in another. _ Republicans express confidence they can virtually sweep the Rocky Mountain region Democrats hope to steal a state or two, perhaps <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. _ The deep South looks strong for the Republicans, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> already has forced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to devote several days to campaigning in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to peel away a border state or two, and maybe even challenge in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. _ The <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home region and his strongest, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Both sides give the Democrat the early edge in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> have recent Republican histories, but are key targets for both candidates. _ The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is wide open, although <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spot on the Republican ticket ended any talk of a Democratic surprise in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Aside from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is viewed as the strong leader in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and ahead less convincingly in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by 9 percentage points in a recent <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> poll, but Republicans rushed to say they doubted either candidate could carry the state by that much. Republicans expect to carry <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Democrats say they have spent the past several weeks methodically building a field organization, preparing television commercials and mapping out their fall campaign, and that the race wo n't be decided until the final days of the campaign. But where the Democrats sounded optimistic 10 weeks ago, now it is the Republicans who have been heartened by their candidate's late-summer offensive Republicans concede <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> probably has the lead in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and a narrow advantage in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for the moment.

<HEAD>Lightning Danger Greater Than Thunder Indicates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both people and lightning-sensitive industries may be in more danger than they realize, according to a researcher who says the hazards of electrical storms have been underestimated. Lightning strikes the earth much more often than weather records based on observers' reports indicate, says <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres. `` Those who have to worry about the risk of lightning damage, for example nuclear power plants, have had to use data based on -LRB- thunder records -RRB- to develop their risk analyses,'' Changnon said in a telephone interview. `` It's very clear that thunder rather dramatically underestimates the frequency of lightning near a given point.'' Changnon discovered by using electromagnetic detectors to record actual cloud-to-ground flashes that between 22 percent and 40 percent of lightning flashes occurred at times when no thunder was heard. `` It is not good news,'' he concluded. Changnon, a researcher affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, also teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> His report was done in conjunction with his son, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s, <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> explained, but they have always depended on the reports of trained observers, primarily listening to the thunder generated by lightning. In recent years, however, electromagnetic detectors have been installed in many areas to record actual lightning strokes. The researchers compared reports by weather observers with the lightning records from sensors used by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in Western states and by electrical utilities along the Eastern seaboard. `` The degree of relationship is relatively weak,'' Changnon reported. `` It gives one a lot of pause, in many respects, about how the atmosphere works, how good our weather records are and how safe we are.'' In the West, Changnon reported, between 31 percent and 40 percent of all lightning strokes were missed by observers listening for thunder. The situation was better in the East, with 22 percent to 26 percent of lightning strokes being missed, the report said. `` The differences are very marked between the East and West,'' Changnon said. This occurs, at least in part, because it is more difficult to hear thunder in mountainous areas, he said. Another batch of the missed lightning strokes occurs before a storm is reported in an area, he said. `` People sometimes say lightning comes out of the blue. It's not necessarily out of the blue, just the front edge of a new or fast-moving storm,'' he said. The study also confirmed that lightning varies considerably from storm to storm. More than half of all electrical storms had only a few cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, while a small number of storms had hundreds of strokes. Indeed, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, records for three years showed that nearly one-quarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted for in just two big storms. The researchers also found a considerable number of thunderstorms with no cloud-to-ground lightning. Cloud-to-cloud lightning is blamed for the thunder in those cases. <PERSON> Changnon </PERSON> said that is more common in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where storm clouds tend to be higher above the ground than in the East. Lightning killed 86 Americans last year, the highest death toll in this decade, according to records kept by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. And the 365 lightning-related injuries reported across the nation were nearly 50 percent more than the long-term average, the agency said. As usual, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last year. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> ranked second with six, followed by five in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and four each in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> each recorded three fatalities. There were two each in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> each recorded a single lightning death for the year.

<HEAD>Council Recommended to Direct Federal Water Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The next president should set up a `` water council'' in his executive office to coordinate federal water policy, which is now fragmented among several agencies, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study recommends. Such a council should include representatives of the states and should be headed by a chairman free of ties to existing departments, said a paper from the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, part of the energy and environment program at the university's <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. The new council `` would derive its principal influence from its direct relationship with the president,'' the paper said. `` The absence of such an entity at present has led to the intolerable situation of no agency within the executive branch currently responsible for taking a comprehensive view of federal water programs.'' The report was written by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, professor of environmental engineering and city planning, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H.W </PERSON>. Foster, adjunct research fellow and environment secretary in the administration of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Republican Gov. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> in 1971-1975. The project was supported by grants from Resources for the Future, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think-tank which released the report last week. Several previous attempts to coordinate federal water policy have failed. Most recently, a statutory inter-agency <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries was formed in 1965 to oversee planning, but was killed by agreement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, which tried to do some of the same work, `` proved ineffectual and became essentially non-functional after its principal enthusiast, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, left office.'' In an interview from <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` moved in on agency programs, and the agencies quite properly went to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The new council, he said, should `` stay out of agency turf,'' and try to `` pull the policy debates out of the agencies, where people are debating themselves, and put them in a forum where they debate other agencies.'' By default, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> is now the chief coordinating agency, and <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> _ a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agency _ strongly opposes creation of a new council on the grounds that `` everybody wants a connection to the president,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` We have a colossal federal establishment, 60,000 or 70,000 employees, working on water subjects,'' he said. `` They ought to be doing things that fit into some plan. `` It's not the most urgent issue facing the incoming president, but if we do n't do something the issues are going to just sit there.''

 Thousands of protesters battled police following the largest anti-government rally since the military nominated right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> as the only candidate in a fall presidential referendum. More than 100,000 people packed blocks of a broad avenue in central <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Sunday chanting `` Pinochet's going to fall!'' Police arrested 262 demonstrators and a police officer and eight civilians were wounded, said Gen. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Badiola </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. He said six of the injured, including the policeman, were seriously hurt. Police fired tear gas, buckshot and water cannons when tens of thousands of people began a march on the government palace after the generally peaceful rally had ended. Organizers said 300,000 people attended the rally and journalists estimated the crowd at more than 100,000. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the 72-year-old army commander who has ruled <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> with a military junta since a coup in September 1973, was selected last Tuesday by himself and the commanders of the navy, air force and national police as the sole candidate in the presidential referendum scheduled for Oct. 5. Sunday's rally was the largest show of force by the opposition since <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, seeking popular support, lifted on Aug. 27 the state of emergency that restricted public gatherings. There had been scattered street demonstrations after <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s nomination was announced Tuesday and three people were shot to death and hundreds were arrested <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Moya </PERSON>, the main speaker at Sunday's rally, told the cheering crowd: `` We can now clearly see that the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> regime already has been defeated.'' <PERSON> Moya </PERSON> is the head of the truckers' union When the rally ended a column of tens of thousands of people marched to the city's center, blocking traffic. Police broke up the procession and there were skirmishes throughout the area between rock-throwing demonstrators and police firing birdshot and tear gas. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, in an `` open letter to the men and women of my country'' printed Sunday in most local newspapers, promised full democracy if he is returned to office in the referendum. `` If Chileans call me to govern, each one of them will govern, too,'' the letter said. In an interview printed Sunday in the conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercurio </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> also promised to resign as army commander and govern as a civilian. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 7.2 million voters are to vote either for or against <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum. If approved, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will begin a new eight-year term in March. If rejected, an open presidential election is to be held in December 1989 with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until an elected president takes office. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the 1973 military coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, a socialist opposition leader, called the rally `` the first step toward the final defeat of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>.'' Rally participants, including Chileans who have returned from exile, sang and danced to political songs. Among the former exiles was <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, 44, a daughter of the late president, who died during the coup. She received a huge ovation when her name was announced and joined in the dancing with <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> on Thursday decreed an end to political exile.

 Vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> are in sharp contrast when it comes to two of the more valuable congressional fringe benefits _ speaking fees and free trips. In the last six years, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, reported honoraria earnings of $ 250,050 from speechmaking and another $ 4,830 from writing articles. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a Democratic senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, accepted absolutely nothing for outside speaking and writing, according to the required financial disclosure statements covering 1982 through 1987. This does n't mean that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is n't popular on the speechmaking circuit. It's because he is one of a handful of senators who decline to take honoraria <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s receipts put him in the mainstream of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where most members routinely pick up $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 a speech from trade associations, corporations, non-profit groups, think tanks and universities. The only restriction in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on such outside income is that if a member's speech and writing fees total more than 40 percent of the official salary _ $ 89,500 _ the excess must be given to a bona fide charity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s 1982-1987 disclosure forms also show that he was far ahead of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in getting free trips _ air fare, lodging and sometimes meals _ often in connection with a paid speech. The Indianian reported 44 expense-paid excursions, including destinations in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In the same six years, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took four free trips, three to his home state, the fourth to <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The two rivals showed parity in one fringe-benefit area, gifts. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> listed two gifts, each a Steuben glass sculpture, with a combined value of $ 2,750. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s $ 2,436 in gifts were in the form of golf equipment and clothing, including $ 825 worth in 1987 from pro golfer <PERSON> Fuzzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoeller </PERSON>, a fellow Indianian. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is an avid, low-handicap golfer. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s top honoraria year was 1983, when he got $ 54,150 for 50 speeches and $ 1,500 for an article for the Institute for <ORGANIZATION> Socioeconometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. There was no limit then on how much a senator could keep. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gave $ 1,250 of his 1983 speaking fees to charity, the same amount as in 1982, when his honoraria totaled $ 40,650, including $ 1,000 from his alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, for one of his 38 paid speeches. A 30 percent-of-salary limit was in effect for 1984, when he made 25 speeches, received $ 26,700 and gave $ 4,930 to charity. In 1985, he got $ 32,600 from 28 speeches, $ 40 from one article and gave $ 10,277 to charity. The following year, with a 40 percent limit, he gave $ 19,991 to charity after earning $ 49,400 from 37 speeches and $ 585 from three articles. Last year, he got $ 46,900 from 35 speeches and $ 2,355 from nine articles and gave $ 14,302 to charity. During the six years, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spoke most often to the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. His 21 appearances there brought him $ 6,600. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was popular with the Grocery Manufacturers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, making a speech to the trade association in 1982 for $ 1,000 and in 1984, 1986 and 1987 for $ 2,000 each of those years. He also received pay for speaking to defense contractors, drug companies and health care associations. He is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees, which handle defense and health care issues. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received speaking fees on 35 of the 44 free trips he made during the six years. There was no speaking money on a five-day stay in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> with his wife in 1982, compliments of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION>. He did get $ 1,500 for a speech on a trip to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that year paid for by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. His peak travel year was 1983 with 15 trips, including three nights in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, _ and a $ 2,000 honoraria _ from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Other free destinations that year included <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Magnavox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Six trips in 1984 included three nights in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> with his wife. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> picked up two nights' lodging. The airfares and the third night were paid by the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constructors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. After a quiet one-trip year in 1985, he made three in 1986, including three nights at an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> tennis resort for the `` 13th Annual Senators' Cup'' charity event. From there, the <ORGANIZATION> Outdoor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> flew the Quayles to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for three days. Last year, there were eight free trips, including charity sports events in <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. He also received a six-night stay in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T; four nights in Ft.. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; and a day trip to <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sulphur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, from the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which paid $ 2,000 for a Each of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s four trips was reported as a one-day excursion.

 Heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> is recuperating today from minor head and chest injuries after apparently being knocked out in a single-car accident near his upstate training camp. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> apparently skidded on a wet road Sunday morning, said a spokesman for the boxer, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>, who gave no other details of the crash. A witness said the accident occurred while <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was driving his car out of the yard at his adopted family's home in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> and it skidded and slammed into a tree. He was found, apparently unconscious. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> was just leaning back in his car seat and I took his pulse,'' said <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, a niece of <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has been close to since he began training in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> eight years ago. `` He was normal, his breathing was n't heavy or labored. I did n't hear anything wrong with him We just could n't arouse him. We tried to wake him up by asking ` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,' and we just could n't get anything from him.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who was recovering from a broken bone in his right hand suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, was taken to two upstate hospitals before being transferred Sunday night to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was hospitalized for observation and diagnostic tests, said Dr. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION>. `` He suffered minor trauma to the head and the chest wall,'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s condition was stable. `` He's neurologicallly normal.'' As <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, his wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, tried to keep waiting photographers away from her husband. As cameramen pressed forward, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> pushed them back, shouting, `` Give him a break.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, whose championship bout against British champ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury, was scheduled to accompany his wife to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday.

 A 71-year-old retiree whose pet crocodile bit off his arm was reunited with `` Charlene'' today and said he'd keep her _ at his other arm's length. `` Its marvellous having her back,'' said <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` The separation has n't changed us.'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Melbourne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper he thought his 23-year friendship with <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON>, a 6 -LCB- - foot saltwater croc, was doomed when she bit the arm that fed her Wildlife officers had wanted to shoot the reptile but <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s family intervened and <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> was exiled to a crocodile farm in <LOCATION> Queensland </LOCATION> `` It was my fault. I asked her if she wanted some fish and I put my hand in the bucket and did n't give her a fish,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` All she could think about was the fish and with my hand being there she bit it.'' Despite losing his right arm and spending three weeks in the hospital after the November 1986 attack, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said he always wanted <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> back. `` I must admit I do keep her at arms length now, but I get in the pen with her and give her a bit of a scratch,'' he said. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> used to take <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> on family outings and to the local pub until she got too heavy to handle, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Tutu: Voters Should Boycott Municipal Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, saying he was `` obeying God'' in defying the government, urged blacks and whites to boycott next month's nationwide but segregated municipal elections. Elsewhere on Sunday, black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> also violated state of emergency rules by calling for increased international economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, in a service at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, described the elections as `` ludicrous'' and `` unjust'' and said the government was attempting to `` force participation.'' `` I urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the October elections and I hope that white Anglicans would join their black fellow Anglicans in that action,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. `` I am aware of the penalties attached to this call. I am not defying the government, I am obeying God,'' the black churchman said. Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials. The black majority has no vote in national affairs, although the nation's 26 million blacks make up about 75 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s population Under the 26-month-old state of emergency it is illegal to call for an election boycott in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. If convicted, violators may be fined or imprisoned. In the 1984 municipal elections, anti-apartheid groups promoted election boycotts and only about 10 percent of eligible black voters went to the polls. Many black activists view black elected officials as collaborators with the white-dominated government and its apartheid policies of racial separation. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate `` non-violent way of expressing our opposition to the evil and injustice of apartheid.'' `` You can not get security through the barrel of a gun, nor through the draconian and oppressive state of emergency,'' he said. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> spoke at a special service to install <PERSON> Canon </PERSON> <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> as dean of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 37, becomes the first black to serve in the post. He spent last year in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and most recently was the chaplin at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION>, a mixed-race school. Minister of Law and Order <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has threatened to clamp down on anti-apartheid clergymen. `` We must clip their wings _ as we clipped those of the 19 revolutionary and activist organizations,'' <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said on Friday in reference to the government's February decision banning most leading anti-apartheid groups. Anti-government church leaders were among the few prominent resistence figures spared in the crackdown, and they now are the most visible domestic opponents of the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> called for increased economic sanctions in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` When we call for sanctions, when we call for disinvestment from this country, it is because we are looking for those peaceful measures as an alternative to the structural violence of the state we see today,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> spoke to 400 people gathered to mark the publication of a biography on her husband, jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The book, entitled `` Higher Than Hope,'' was written by South African academic <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON>, who also was present. The 70-year-old <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best known black leader, is in a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> clinic recuperating from tuberculosis. He has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule.

 Three years ago, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance in her high school class and caused a nationwide stir. Today, she still gets hate mail, heckled on the street and drawn into an occasional fistfight. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, now a 20-year-old hairdresser, says the memory of her yearlong rebellion at <ORGANIZATION> Randolph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> remains strong. Residents of this town, 13 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, `` will always remember,'' she says. Hostile letters still trickle in. Every month, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> says, an anonymous letter arrives from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with a small flag sticker. The author usually writes `` watch out, we'll never forget, the people never forget,'' said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, whose defiance was not directly related to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 1977 veto of an amendment that would have required <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. The controversy began during <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>'s junior year in 1984. She said one of her teachers explained that students need not stand for the <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegiance </ORGANIZATION> unless they wanted to. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said she and half of her class decided to not stand. She said she considers herself patriotic but does `` not believe that the American flag is a symbol of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' But when <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> entered her senior year, a teacher took issue with her decision to remain seated. `` She told me I was spitting on the American flag. ... I asked her, ` How would you like it if I spit on you?''' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> recalled during a recent interview at her home in <LOCATION> Randolph </LOCATION> where she lives with her parents and her older brother. The incident found its way into a local newspaper. Within days, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> was interviewed by national publications and the television networks. But the publicity boomeranged and <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> found herself the target of hate letters, death threats and near assaults. In one incident, a grenade-like device exploded on the lawn of the <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> family home, a modest ranch-style house on a tree-lined street. The explosion burned a 6-inch patch of the front lawn but caused no injuries. `` For a while I could n't go to school,'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. `` I got a lot of death threats.'' <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> skipped her prom and graduation because of the furor. But all year long, when she did attend school, she refused to stand up during the daily Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>, keep a box of the letters from the height of the controversy. Some were supportive, such as ones from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who encouraged her. Mrs. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> also backed her daughter's defiance. `` We're patriots We do n't hate this country. My husband and brother are veterans,'' she said. But feelings against <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> ran high. Many letters carried swastikas. Many were obscene. The outside of one letter warns that the postal carrier `` might not want to deliver to these people.'' `` You utter creep _ I hope someone blows you up,'' another said. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> is cynical about the recent political flap between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and presidential rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 1977 veto. `` I just wonder where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was when this was happening to me,'' she says. Today, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> is content to remain in town working at a local mall as a hairdresser. Though she still gets heckled, she said she now knows how to defend herself. She said she's been in four fistfights since 1985. Who wins `` Me. I make my point,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanitary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> is trying to clean up its image with a new name, but it's doubtful employees will want to be known as `` sludge-busters'' or `` scummy can cleaners. `` People hear ` sanitary' and they think ` garbage,''' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirie </PERSON>, the district's finance commissioner. `` But we reclaim and purify water and control floods _ that's our job.'' <PERSON> Kirie </PERSON>, 77, decided to hold a contest to find a better moniker and is personally offering a $ 1,000 first prize for the best name. He said he has wanted to change the name for nearly two decades. Letters, poems, and dummy logos _ scrawled in crayon or professionally typeset _ have spelled out clever and not-so-clever suggestions. `` Metropolitan Sludge-Buster Treatment Department,'' `` Groovy and Pure Channel District,'' `` Cook County Waters ` R' Us,'' and `` Scummy Can Cleaners'' were among the suggestions. Some came up with names that suggested a theme park: `` <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Angels </PERSON>,'' and `` Everything Water.'' One woman thought `` Aqua Fix'' captured the essence of the department, while one man thought `` Washers of Water -LRB- WOW -RRB-'' summed it up best.

 Mayor <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says the `` Dress As You Please Day'' is no longer a fashion hit and decided not to observe the day of casual attire this year. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> proclaimed a day for casual dress his first year as mayor and drew nationwide attention. Similar observances followed in 1986 and 1987, but fewer and fewer downtown workers took part. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, says there's simply been no demand for it this year. `` If people really wanted it, we'd do it, but we've only had one phone call asking about it,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said last week.

But former police chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Still </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s challenger in this fall's election, insists <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> dropped the event this year in an effort to present a more conservative image to the electorate. Though the official observance of casual dress may be dead, some employees keep it alive at City Hall, where air conditioning is unknown. The city auditor allows shorts in the office when the mercury tops 90 degrees, as it did last week.

<HEAD>Eastern Posts Court Bond, Layoffs Effective Sept. 10</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> will lay off 4,000 workers Saturday now that the financially troubled carrier has posted a $ 4.7 million bond with a federal court in case unions battling the cuts win their case. The bond was posted late Saturday, airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said Sunday. `` The layoffs will be effective September 10 at the end of the employees' normal shift,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. `` We really do n't know what the exact number of employees will be. Some may take early retirement, there are different options.'' No union spokesmen could be reached for comment late Sunday. But spokesmen earlier had said they eventually would win their case. `` We strongly believe that the earlier ruling will be upheld,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> local of the machinists' union The airline in July announced plans for the layoffs and service cutbacks in 14 cities. The unions, however, contend that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, is stripping the Miami-based carrier's assets in favor of sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Eastern has lost about $ 1 billion during the past decade. The three main unions sued when the layoff plans, the largest in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60-year history, were announced. Those affected include management, about 1,000 flight attendants, 1,000 machinists and 500 pilots. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> dissolved an order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, who ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could proceed with the service cuts but could not lay off union members. The appeals court said the carrier would have to post the bond to cover a month of paychecks should the unions win. After the machinists' union balked at pay and benefit cuts, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> asked federal mediators to declare contract talks at an impasse. If mediators, who have been involved off and on since January, make the declaration and no agreement is reached after a 30-day cooling off period, the unions could strike and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could impose its terms on workers. Machinists union members are to vote Sept. 15 on a company proposal for $ 161 million in annual wage concessions. The company and its flight attendants' union Thursday reached a deal under which some workers would take leaves with workers keeping seniority if called back. Service is being cut to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Pointe-a-Pitre, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Agreement Only Chance To Make Solidarity Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity chairman <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> defended ending <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most serious strike wave in seven years as the only chance to legalize the independent union movement, and said he would not tolerate wildcat strikes. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, before 4,000 people in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Sunday, responded to Solidarity supporters who accused him of agreeing too easily to end the strikes and should first have secured a firm agreement from authorities on legalization. `` There is no other way. I must take this chance and I will,'' he said. `` I put out the strikes and I will put out the next ones. I have not betrayed the people.'' The occupation strikes, which began Aug. 16, ended Saturday at <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s urging. Three days earlier, senior government officials met with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and promised `` roundtable'' talks on legalizing Solidarity in exchange for an end to the labor unrest. The meeting was the first of its kind since communist authorities banned Solidarity with a December 1981 military crackdown that ended the 15-month heyday of the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> spoke to supporters in the courtyard of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s Roman Catholic church after an emotional pro-Solidarity Mass `` To those who criticize me: Stop it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` Such -LRB- decisions -RRB- are demanded by higher necessity They -LRB- authorities -RRB- spat on me and now I am extending my hand because there is a chance to make <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met with about a dozen top advisers on Sunday to discuss the composition of a proposed workers' delegation to the government talks, which in addition to focusing on Solidarity also would address jointly confronting lifting <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> out of economic stagnation. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> has said an end to strikes would automatically mean convening the talks. The strikes ended Saturday when about 250 strikers carrying a Solidarity banner walked out of the July Manifesto coal mine in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and 2,400 bus and dock workers cut short strikes in the northern port of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. At their peak, the strikes affected 20 enterprises with 100,000 employees. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s two biggest ports were virtually shut down and production of coal from the <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> region, a vital source of hard currency, was sharply reduced. Miners at the July Manifesto mine started the wave of strikes, disgruntled by paychecks they said fell short of expected raises. They demanded better working conditions and compensation for 60 percent inflation. But like other workers around the country who quickly joined in the strikes, their No. 1 demand was the restoration of Solidarity's legal status Communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unions in an agreement signed Aug. 31, 1980, in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, opening the way to legal registration of the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. On Sunday, tens of thousands of supporters of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> union gathered for a Mass at the <PERSON> Jasna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gora </PERSON> monastery in the southern city of <LOCATION> Czestochowa </LOCATION>. Farmers orginally belonged to the main Solidarity federation, but won their own union in May 1981. It also was outlawed after martial law.

<HEAD>Study Says Sweatshops Not A Thing Of The Past</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government report says sweatshops, thought to be a thing of the past in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> labor, continue to exist in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released Sunday cited restaurants and related businesses, apparel manufacturing and meat-processing industries as the worst offenders. `` I think most Americans believe sweatshops vanished generations ago, but they are here today, in all parts of the country,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who had requested the study, in a statement released with the report. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> also said he supported the report's conclusion that penalties for labor law violations must be increased to deter abuses. The report, based on interviews with 100 state and local officials nationwide between January and May 1988, said restaurant and apparel sweatshops were more likely to be populated by Hispanics and Asians workers. The report also cited some of the same reasons for multiple labor-law violations that were given in the 19th century: a large immigrant work force and low profit margins in labor-intensive industries.

<HEAD>Former Members of Congress Reap Big Retirement Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A taxpayers group says that more and more former members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will become millionaires in retirement. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday former Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Reifel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> joins a former <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> senator this month as the first members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to receive $ 1 million in government retirement pay. `` While most Americans can only dream of a million dollars in retirement income, dozens of retired legislators will soon become pension millionaires,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, executive vice president of the taxpayers group, in a news release. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reifel </PERSON> will receive a September pension check for $ 6,966, giving the former five-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 1 million since he retired from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. In May, former Republican Sen. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> became the first senator to get a millionaire pension, said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. Congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula that includes the average congressional salary over the last three years, and the group predicted that a proposed increase in congressional pay to $ 135,000 next year would greatly increase the number of million-dollar pensions.

<TEXT>
 Flying across this nation, it is virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally ribbon the landscape. There are just vast seas of muddy brown water _ and millions of stranded people. Floods have inundated three-quarters of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and cut transportation links from its major port to the capital and other interior cities, officials say, though adding today that flood waters on three major rivers were receding. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years and covered three-fourths of the capital. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers today reported 60 more deaths, bringing the toll to at least 942 since June, when rivers began overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this impoverished nation of 110 million people. The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low. Millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy, probably contaminated water, and 83,000 people nationwide have contracted diarrheal diseases, said Health Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Munim </PERSON>. He said 65 people have died of the diseases so far. `` It is a calamity,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters Sunday night. `` It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.'' Flying in an airplane across <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Sunday from the Indian border to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, even the civilian pilot could n't differentiate between the rivers and the flood waters. `` I've never seen anything like it before,'' said <PERSON> Ghias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, who has been flying over his country for 19 years. The waters swallowed up entire villages. Occasionally, tin roofs glinted in the sunlight, the houses beneath them completely submerged. On a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road still above water, people milled idly, small boats beached beside them. The Ganges and <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> rivers and their dozens of tributaries flow from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and through <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Last year, the flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> killed about 1,500 people. This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centers or relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 million people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small outcroppings of high ground with few supplies. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and pumps are flooded, officials said, and flood water, which is probably impure, is the only source of drinking water. The central government has appealed for foreign aid, including boats, helicopters and 3 million tons of grain. Officials today reported water levels falling on the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> and Meghna rivers. But relief officials can not reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely broken down. `` Shortages of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' a relief ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and could prevent planting of the winter rice crop. He said this might lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice. The minister said <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needs 18 million tons of rice a year to feed its people. He said 16.5 million tons are grown at home and 1.5 million imported. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people, gasoline has become scarce for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets. Many gas stations are closed. Boats have replaced cars and bicycle-powered rickshaws in many parts of the city. River boats capable of carrying 100 to 200 people sail between partly submerged houses in low-lying neighborhoods flooded by the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turag </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sitalakhya </PERSON> rivers that surround <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on three sides. Many of the capital's streets are knee-deep and waist-deep in murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage, and adults and children alike wade through it. Over the last week, the price of rice nearly doubled, from 15 cents a pound to 28 cents, as those who could afford it started hoarding.

 The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen in foreign exchange dealings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Monday, while share prices lost ground in afternoon trading. After opening at 136.25 yen, the dollar was traded between 135.95 yen and 136.35 yen and ended Monday's session at 136.03 yen, down 0.72 yen from Friday's closing. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 371.75-point winner during last Saturday's half-day session, lost 146.67 points, or 0.53 percent, to close at 27,341.58.

<TEXT>
 Investigators concluded work at the site of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner crash that killed 13 of the 108 people aboard, refusing to comment about reports that two engines may have failed. Some pilots speculated that two of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727's three engines may have failed because the wing flaps apparently were retracted at the time of the crash, rather than extended for takeoff, The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` When someone says ` engine failure' there are a whole host of things that might mean,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` One of the things I will not do is speculate on anything.'' A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine failure. Two loud pops were then heard, which could have indicated a `` compressor stall.'' But <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said a compressor stall, which occurs when an engine is starving for air, is not critical: `` Keep in mind, compressor stall is not serious, it's a hiccup.'' Flight 1141 crashed and burned on takeoff Wednesday at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on a flight for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. On Sunday, workers at the crash site sealed the cockpit in a plastic blue tarpaulin. The wreckage was to be hauled to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where it would be dismantled and studied, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. Two flight attendants were taken to the wreckage and questioned, but <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he had no information on what they told investigators. The role of the wing flaps, which are extended during takeoff to provide added lift, continued to be discussed Flight Engineer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> has told investigators the flaps were extended in the proper position upon takeoff. But evidence from the wreckage indicates the flaps were completely or almost completely retracted. `` We have further verification that the flaps were retracted,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> pilot participating in the investigation on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes Flight 1141's pilot could have been facing engine failure and decided to retract the flaps in a last-ditch effort to save the plane. `` A 727 will still fly if it loses one engine, but all 727 pilots know if you lose two engines, the only way you can fly the plane off is to get rid of the flaps,'' <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> said, noting the manuever is not an approved emergency procedure. `` With two engines out, there's only one way that plane could fly _ with the flaps up.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said he did n't know what the procedure for the pilot would have been if both engines failed: `` Each airline has different operations. As you know, we will be documenting <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s procedure. The 48-year-old pilot, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, remained hospitalized today and has been visited at Parkland Memorial Hospital by other survivors offering thanks for the way he handled the crash, enabling 95 people to survive. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is scheduled to under surgery Tuesday to have a metal plate implanted under his left eye, said his 21-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. He suffered numerous facial fractures and a back injury. `` He realizes that it's God that did the miracle,'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Sunday. `` God is the reason that he's alive. There's something that God has planned for him.''

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said today that it has no intention of disrupting the 24th Olympic Games, which begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 17, and said any incident or sabotage `` will have nothing to do with us.'' A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement said: `` We hereby make it clear that we do not have the slightest intention to obstruct the progress of the Games or threaten them by force of arms. `` If anything happens in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Olympic Games, it will have nothing to do with us and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities themselves should be held responsible for it,'' said the statement. It was carried by the north's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The statement said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> announced last Saturday that it would not participate in the Olympics because of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to manipulate the Games into permanently dividing the two Koreas. The communist north, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s bitter rival since the 1950-53 Korean War, had demanded to co-host the Games. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the demand, saying the Games are awarded to only one city. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> spurned an <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> offer that it host all or part of five sports. South Korean authorities have said they fear <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> might stage terrorist attacks to interrupt the Games, which are seen as an unparalleled chance for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to gain worldwide stature and exposure. Several times in recent years, shooting has occurred across the tense Demilitarized Zone that divides the two countries. And in November, a <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> jetliner disappeared near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, with all 115 people aboard believed to have died. A self-described North Korean agent said she helped plant a bomb aboard the plane to disrupt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s presidential elections and the Olympics. `` As for ` terrorism,' it is utterly alien to us and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> itself is the chieftain of state terrorism as already exposed to the world,'' the nNorth's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` We have no intention to ` invade the South' and this is fully borne out by the historical facts over the last 35 years'' since the Korean War cease-fire, the statement said. It also accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of creating tension on the troubled <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula through various military exercises as an excuse to invade <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` They are abusing the name of Olympics for stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression against our republic and plainly shows their scheme to cause a shocking incident and start another war in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in case the Games do not go as they wish,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains about 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and is planning to hold naval exercises off the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> during the Games to deter any attacks from outside.

<TEXT>
 A week after disaster struck a West German air show, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s top aviation event opened with a Soviet cargo plane aborting takeoff when flames shot from one of its engines 100 yards from spectators. The flames flared 20 feet from a port engine of the blue-and-white Antonov-124 cargo carrier and a loud bang followed as the world's heaviest aircraft began its takeoff Sunday before 10,000 spectators. A pilot cut the three other jet engines and halted the 400-ton aircraft of the Soviet Aeroflot state airline. No one was injured. A Soviet official, speaking on condition of anonymity, promised that the 400-ton plane would fly again at the <ORGANIZATION> Farnborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Show `` before the end of the week.'' He gave no cause for mishap. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today: `` A loud bang was heard all of a sudden during the run, literally several seconds before the takeoff: a small flame appearing in one of the engines. Though everything ended smoothly, the crew took a decision to put off the flight.'' Experts at air show, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s main aviation showcase, said the engine must have stopped combustion as maximum fuel was pumped through for a short takeoff to impress the crowds. Before the aborted takeoff, the Soviets thrilled first-day spectators with displays by their MiG-29s. Organizers stressed that safety regulations at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, were stringent. Their comments came after the Aug. 28 disaster at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Three Italian jets collided during an aerobatics display at a <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> air show, and one of the aircraft hurtled in flames into spectators, killing more than 50 and injuring more than 300. The display aircraft at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> all had to fly away from the crowd and most performed alone. All the aircraft were inspected by the organizers before takeoff. The two MiGs, the first advanced Soviet combat aircraft to take part in a Western display, took star billing. One of the twin-tailed fighters, painted in camouflage gray, zoomed 3,000 feet into the sky from takeoff then fell backward, nose still pointing up. Before gasping spectators, the pilot forced the nose down, pulling the aircraft into level flight in a maneuver known as `` tail-slide''.

Whittle was at the show to unveil a new <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> jet engine, the RB211-524L, claimed to be the most powerful in the world.

 Flying across this nation, it is virtually impossible to discern the mighty rivers that normally ribbon the landscape. There are just vast seas of muddy brown water _ and millions of stranded people. Floods have inundated three-quarters of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and cut transportation links from its major port to the capital and other interior cities, officials say, though adding today that flood waters on three major rivers were receding. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, flood waters were at their highest levels in 54 years and covered three-fourths of the capital. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers reported 60 more flood deaths today, bringing the toll to at least 1,007 since June, when rivers began overflowing their banks in annual monsoon flooding in this impoverished nation of 110 million people. The government count of 333 dead is widely considered low. Millions of the marooned are eating raw food and drinking muddy, probably contaminated water, and 83,000 people nationwide have contracted diarrheal diseases, said Health Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Munim </PERSON>. He said 65 people have died of the diseases so far. `` It is a calamity,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters Sunday night. `` It is a havoc-creating, menacing flood.'' Flying in an airplane across <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> Sunday from the Indian border to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, even the civilian pilot could n't differentiate between the rivers and the flood waters. `` I've never seen anything like it before,'' said <PERSON> Ghias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON>, who has been flying over his country for 19 years. The waters swallowed up entire villages. Occasionally, tin roofs glinted in the sunlight, the houses beneath them completely submerged. On a few high spots of ground or short stretches of paved road still above water, people milled idly, small boats beached beside them. The Ganges and <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> rivers and their dozens of tributaries flow from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and through <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> to the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoon rains in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Last year, the flooding in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> killed about 1,500 people. This season, some refugees have found shelter in relief centers or relatives' homes, said government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. But they estimated that at least 20 million people were either stranded in their homes or marooned on small outcroppings of high ground with few supplies. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and pumps are flooded, officials said, and flood water, which is probably impure, is the only source of drinking water. The central government has appealed for foreign aid, including boats, helicopters and 3 million tons of grain. Officials today reported water levels falling on the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION> and Meghna rivers. But relief officials can not reach many parts of the country because transportation has widely broken down. `` Shortages of medicine, cooked food and drinking water is causing untold miseries to millions of marooned people,'' a relief ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The information minister said flood waters destroyed crops and could prevent planting of the winter rice crop. He said this might lead to a shortfall of 2 million tons of rice. The minister said <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needs 18 million tons of rice a year to feed its people. He said 16.5 million tons are grown at home and 1.5 million imported. In <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people, gasoline has become scarce for the few motor vehicles still navigating the streets. Many gas stations are closed. Boats have replaced cars and bicycle-powered rickshaws in many parts of the city. River boats capable of carrying 100 to 200 people sail between partly submerged houses in low-lying neighborhoods flooded by the <LOCATION> Buriganga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turag </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sitalakhya </PERSON> rivers that surround <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on three sides. Many of the capital's streets are knee-deep and waist-deep in murky black water that carries a strong stench of sewage, and adults and children alike wade through it. Over the last week, the price of rice nearly doubled, from 15 cents a pound to 28 cents, as those who could afford it started hoarding.

<TEXT>
 Just one day after <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first bullfight, a city official vowed to put an end to `` bull baiting,'' but <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> said a ban would deprive them of an important facet of their cultural heritage. During a Hispanic festival Saturday, four matadors confronted three bulls in front of about 300 people in a temporary arena. It was a `` bloodless bullfight,'' in which matadors used capes to attract the 1,000-pound bulls, but the animals had Velcro patches glued to their backs to catch the matadors' Velcro-covered swords and darts. `` This bloodless bullfight is just another form of teasing and torment,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>, executive director of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> and Control, said Sunday `` The cruelest thing they're doing is teasing the animal. ... It's not right, but it's not physically harming the animal. We've got enough of animal exploitation We do n't need this.'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said he plans to ask Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and other city officials for an ordinance to ban `` bull baiting.'' But an aide to state Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a festival organizer, said bullfighting is part of Hispanic culture and should not be banned. `` They've already taken away our language in schools,'' said the aide, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancilla </PERSON>. `` Now they want to take away our folklore, tradition, heritage, culture. You just ca n't keep doing that and have people stand for it.'' While real bullfighting is not permitted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, three states _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have allowed the bloodless variety, <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has an ordinance to prevent bullfights. But <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ordered the city to grant a permit to <ORGANIZATION> Jaass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> to stage the exhibition because the bulls are not killed. After watching Saturday's bullfight with an investigator from his staff and state officials, <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said the animals were not treated harshly. `` The promoters kept their word. There was no blood drawn,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. `` The animals were in excellent condition _ well fed. There was a good corral area. You could tell they were well cared for.'' Many of the spectators were also concerned about the animals. `` Most of the people were rooting for the bulls,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. `` They cheered when the matadors got knocked down.'' The bulls' ultimate destination is the butcher shop, said breeder <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Correla </PERSON>. The animals `` learn quickly'' and can only be used for one bullfight, he said. `` We use them for hamburger.''

<HEAD>Woman In Suspended Animation For Nearly Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 76-year-old woman was placed in suspended animation nearly an hour as surgeons removed an egg-sized aneurysm from the base of her brain, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> remained comatose Sunday and listed in critical condition, four days after the unusual operation, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Secreto </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` It's not uncommon for it to last a couple of days,'' Ms. <PERSON> Secreto </PERSON> said. Surgeons removed the aneurysm from Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'s brain after dropping her body temperature by 40 degrees and draining the blood from her body. Her heart was stopped during Wednesday's operation. The coma was induced by barbiturates to protect the brain while blood flow was suspended, said Ms. <PERSON> Secreto </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON>, a neurosurgeon, said Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> fit the legal criteria for brain death during the 51 -LCB- minutes of suspended animation. The aneurysm, a bubble in the blood vessel caused by weakness in the vessel wall, was suctioned out while Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> was on the bypass machine. Any more pressure by the aneurysm would have compressed on the vital centers of the brain stem, and her heart would have stopped or she would have gone into a coma and died, <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON> said. `` I'm still worried about her but, objectively speaking, there is a good chance she may pull through this thing,'' he said. Post-surgical scans showed increased brain activity, and Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> was moving her legs when touched, according to <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON>. But, he said, `` There's such a fine line between a perfect outcome and her never waking up. That's the hard thing.'' Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> had become almost completely disabled during the past year because of the aneurysm. <PERSON> Bailes </PERSON> initially had recommended that Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> go to the <ORGANIZATION> Barrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where he learned the procedure before coming to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> in July. She did not want to leave <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, however. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spetzler </PERSON>, director of the Barrow institute, and six colleagues published an article on the technique in June in The Journal of Neurosurgery. Of the seven cases cited, all but one patient survived and four had `` excellent'' results. The two other survivors reported some weakness but otherwise did well.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Fall In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both the dollar and stock prices lost ground in cautious trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today. The dollar opened at 136.25 yen, down 0.50 yen from Friday's close, and then declined further to end the day at 136.03 yen, down 0.72 yen The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency ranged between 135.95 yen and 136.35 yen, with spot trading estimated at $ 4.4 billion. It was the first day-to-day decline in the dollar in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> since last Monday. Foreign exchange traders were in a cautious mood because the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market was closed for the Labor Day holiday, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` In addition, today is Monday, when trading usually gets cautious, which makes it even harder for investors to figure out which direction the market is going to go,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` That's why the dollar-yen exchange rate changed frequently within a narrow range,'' he added. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 371.75 points during Saturday's half-day session, lost 146.67 points, or 0.53 percent, closing at 27,341.58 Although the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index opened the day strongly, it then reversed directions as trading slowed down. `` The dollar-yen rate, which is getting stable, and the increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate made investors less worried about inflation, but they could n't be completely optimistic yet,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` After the active trading in the early morning, some investors started selling stocks for profit-taking, which was another reason that prices went down,'' he said. But he said the market was regaining its strength as unfavorable external factors disappeared. `` The market just needs a little more energy. But share prices usually do n't rise much the day after a big rebound anyway,'' he added. Trading on the market's first section was thin, with an estimated 500 million shares changing hands, compared with the 524 million shares traded during the half day Saturday. Among issues losing ground were steels and electricals.

<TEXT>
 A telephone caller posing as a hospital employee persuaded a woman to cut off her hair after tricking her with a false tale of possible exposure to toxic chemicals. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said Sunday she was `` spooked'' by the incident and had temporarily moved out of her home here. `` Let's hope the police do something about it,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, 21, reported the incident to authorities Saturday. She bought a $ 60 wig to cover her shorn locks. `` He kept saying, ` Be sure to cut close to the scalp, so we get a good test,''' Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. The man, who claimed to work for <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, told Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> she might have been exposed to toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, through her former husband, a truck driver who sometimes hauls chemicals. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> had already been admitted to the hospital for tests, some of which confirmed the contamination, the caller told Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. When Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> asked to speak to <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> she was told he was still groggy from sedation. Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> then told the caller she wanted to go to the hospital, but the caller told her she was `` under quarantine'' and would have to cut samples of her hair at home, which the state health department would collect later. After she finished cutting her hair, the caller told Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> it was a hoax, she said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebenitsch </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman, said Sunday the hospital does not have an employee by the name the caller used.

 The missile cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is on its way home in the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force reduction in the region since the Iran-Iraq cease-fire took hold. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has also begun its planned naval cutbacks in the gulf region. British officials said a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer was badly damaged when it collided with a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> cargo ship it was to escort. The USS Vincennes was officially detached from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Sunday for a 13,000-mile voyage to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, where it had been based until April, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources in the gulf, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> shot down an Iranian A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard. It mistook the jet for an Iranian F-14 fighter. An official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report blamed the tragedy on crew stress in a first-time combat situation. The 9,600-ton warship, the first of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s high-tech `` Aegis'' cruisers deployed in the gulf, was pulled out of the waterway after the disaster and operated in the Arabian Sea. Sources said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> would not be replaced, in effect reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet from 27 to 26 ships. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources said the Pentagon has given no timetable for cutbacks and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships are being replaced as planned. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said Sunday afternoon that the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> `` was still part of the Joint Task Force Middle East.'' He declined to say if the ship was preparing to leave or would be replaced because `` we do n't discuss operations of ships.'' Hours before it was to sail, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was one of several warships that responded to a distress call from the British destroyer <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> after its collision with the freighter Tor Bay in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. The 4,100-ton destroyer, with a gaping 9-foot hole in its port bow and its bridge crumpled by the impact, reached the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Fujairah </LOCATION>. Three crewmen were hospitalized with broken bones, naval sources said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced it was withdrawing the aircraft carrier <PERSON> Clemenceau </PERSON> and three other ships from its Indian Ocean fleet, which covers the gulf. The other vessels were the destroyer <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Chayla </PERSON>, the oiler <PERSON> Var </PERSON> and the Cantho, one of three French minehunters in the area. The French move reduces its squadron from 11 warships to seven. That is the largest single cutback since the Aug. 20 cease-fire by any of the six Western governments that have kept naval forces in the gulf region during the past year to protect merchant shipping from attack. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said the move was made `` taking into account the evolution of the situation in the region and the new perspectives for peace.'' Western forces in the region have said they intend to reduce their numbers, which total more than 60 warships of various types, if the Iran-Iraq cease-fire continues to hold. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the first to cut back, withdrew a frigate the day after the truce began. It still has five ships _ two frigates, two mine-hunters and a supply vessel _ in the gulf region. Other warships include eight British, one Belgian, one Dutch and as many as nine Soviet vessels.

 A plainclothes officer was shot dead in the year's first gang-related police slaying, and authorities said joint local and federal efforts were not stopping the violence that may make 1988 the bloodiest ever. Officer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> was shot in the face during a drive-by shooting Saturday night in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He and his partner were pursuing a car believed to be involved in another such shooting minutes earlier that wounded three, police said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, 30, died later at a hospital. The six-year veteran leaves behind a pregnant wife and three children. A 20-year-old gang member believed to be the triggerman was arrested Sunday. With flags outside police headquarters standing at half staff Sunday, Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> lamented the department's loss. `` Here was a fine officer and family man, with a child he'll never see, dead because of some no-good, miserable sons of bitches out there that society allows to roam the streets,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> is the first police officer killed in a drive-by shooting, which has often been used by gangs. A police officer in 1987 was killed in a gang gun battle. Eleven people were slain in gang shootings in the last weekend of August, and more than 200 people have died this year. The death toll should climb to an all-time high of more than 400 by year's end, making 1988 the bloodiest year ever for gang crimes, officials said There were a record 387 gang-related murders in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> in 1987. The violence has left law enforcement officials struggling to end the rampage. Police launched a full-scale assault in March. Twice since then, the <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> has marched 1,000 officers into the most gang-infested areas on weekends. Overall crime rate declined, but the gang murder rate continues to climb. `` We're in a holding action. We're keeping the flames from spreading but we're not putting them out,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Philibosian </PERSON>, former county district attorney and head of the state task force on gangs and drugs. While the carnage mounts, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gangs continue to export their drug trade to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as they expand their rock cocaine-trafficking network. `` It's going to take years. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has worked at stopping the drug problem for 30 years and still has n't stopped it,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawler </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> chief for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's a form of life to some people. It may be an entire generation before this goes away.'' The <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> will continue the sweeps but begin expanding tactics by targeting hardcore leaders of the most powerful neighborhood gangs, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON>. Prosecutors, police and the school district are trying to help with such programs as GREAT, the Gang Reporting, Evaluation and Tracking; RSVP, the Reduction of Street Violence Program, and OASIS, for Operation Stay in School. And the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of former gang members and others, gave jobs to 111 gang members this summer. Southside clergy members tried their part this summer by holding two gang summits. The first in July attracted about a dozen `` gang-bangers.'' A two-day summit last week drew 50, and when it ended, the members of the rival <LOCATION> Crips </LOCATION> and Bloods vowed to lay down their guns, end their gang affiliations and form a network to convince other `` homeboys'' to do the same. `` We have intelligence and want a quality education. I know that we're running out of time ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, listen today,'' said gang member <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, who attended the summit. Officials criticized the summits for giving a false impression of optimism because the small number of gang members participating do n't represent the 70,000 members from the 600 street gangs. But organizers say at least they're doing something. Officials also cautioned it will be a long time before the programs and law enforcment efforts take effect. `` Be patient a little longer,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of the county sheriff's department. `` It will change. We'll get a handle on it, but it wo n't be an overnight thing. We will win. We will finally beat them down.''

<HEAD>China's Top Dissident Says Anti-Marxist Feeling Widespread</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading dissident said today that anti-Marxist feeling is widespread in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but that obstacles to independent labor or political groups remain formidable in the authoritarian state. `` Many people do n't agree with Marxism, even workers and students,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, a 52-year-old astrophysicist, said during an interview with four Western journalists. `` Even people of my generation ... do n't believe in Marxism.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> supports a multiparty democracy over one-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule and believes the first step toward political reform should be seeking freedom of speech and of the press, which is now strictly controlled by the state. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the seat of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that still claims to be the legitimate ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, could provide an example of political reform with the recent end of a ban on opposition parties, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. Although <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s multiparty system is just getting started, `` at least it's better than the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- mainland,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> acknowledged conditions are not yet ripe for formation of new political groups in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` They should wait -LRB- until -RRB- the private economy becomes dominant, or at least becomes a larger factor,'' said <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who stressed that the emergence of an independent middle class may be key to creating new political forces. In the past decade, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has introduced a number of market-oriented economic reforms to stimulate production and modernize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution nearly destroyed the economy. Private enterprise is flourishing in some regions, although <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders still believe in central economic planning. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was purged from the party last year when authorities accused him of inciting pro-democracy student demonstrations in several cities. He was forced to resign from his post as vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province, and was transferred to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>, where he continues his research and writing. Workers share many of the students demands for political freedom but face a daunting task organizing independent groups such as the outlawed Solidarity labor movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said. `` The organization of dissident organizations, something like an independent union, is very difficult'' because of strong government opposition, he said. Many Chinese students regard <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> as a hero for his outspoken criticism of the Communist government. When he spoke informally to a group at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, a crowd of students thrust books, envelopes and paper money for him to sign. Chinese authorities have allowed <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> to travel overseas despite his criticism. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> acknowledged that <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> may be trying to improve its image by allowing him to speak out but added: `` I also use the opportunity to say more.'' The astrophysicist said he does not want to get into politics or form a political party. Instead, he views his role as `` introducing some concepts'' to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, such as democracy. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> believes democracy can work in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the nation's dynastic history of authoritarian rule and unwieldy size of more than 1 billion people He suggests democracy would help reduce many of the country's ills, including rampant corruption. During the interview, he harshly rejected Marxism as the worst thing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> says it is difficult to know the precise policy position of any leader because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has `` no glasnost,'' a reference to the Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, a professor of physics at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, were briefly in the British colony on the southeastern coast of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at the invitation of a local college. They arrived after visiting <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> today began his first trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a five-day visit expected to include discussions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms sales in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlucci </LOCATION> is to hold talks on global, regional and bilateral issues with his host, National Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Qiwei </PERSON>. He is also scheduled to meet <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leader, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. He spent two days in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where he was met at the airport by Gen. <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenzhong </PERSON>, head of the bureau of foreign affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is expected to restate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s arms sales to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says could destabilize military balances in that volatile region. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has reportedly sold Silkworm anti-ship missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and recently agreed to supply <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> with medium-range surface-to-surface missiles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is also trying to sell to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> a shorter-range missile now under development. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which denies selling Silkworms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, is building up its arms industry to help finance the modernization of its own armed forces. When Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> brought up the issue of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> sales during a visit in July, the Chinese said the weapons were of a defensive nature and the sales carried out in a responsible manner. Chinese officials are, in turn, likely to urge <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to ease restrictions on sales of high technology items to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Chinese say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen are losing business to Japanese and European competitors because the Pentagon is reluctant to allow transfer of some types of technology. In particular, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is expected to urge the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to give the go-ahead for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to use Chinese Long March rockets to launch satellites. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is to make a decision on the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> launches later this month. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> grant export licenses for the satellites, but the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has objected, saying that would undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies trying to develop satellite launching services. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s visit is the third by a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, following visits by former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> in 1983 and 1986. Visits and personnel exchanges between the militaries of the two countries have become common, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have grown at a steady if modest pace. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supplied <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with transport helicopters and avionics equipment for Chinese fighter planes, and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is now holding negotiations on possible sales of about a dozen CH-47 helicopters for use in a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rapid deployment force. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is also to travel to the ancient capital of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> and stop in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where he will tour a Chinese naval facility.

 Kurdish guerrillas claimed today they have killed or wounded 7,000 Iraqi soldiers in fierce fighting in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They said nearly 2,000 civilians also died. The guerrillas acknowledged several of their bases have been overrun. They said the bases fell after repeated poison gas attacks. There was no independent confirmation of the Kurdish claims. Turkish officials said that about 90,000 Kurds, including some wounded guerrillas, have fled across the frontier in recent days. `` Most of the Kurdish civilian casualties are from constant Iraqi poison gas attacks on their villages and settlements,'' a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` Iraqi troops has overrun our bases in <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dahok </LOCATION> provinces, but our guerrillas are still engaged in fierce fighting inside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to save our civilian population from severe <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> reprisals,'' he said. The spokesman, based in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital, has given information to the AP on several other occasions. He declined to give his name for security reasons. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been waging their separatist struggle on and off for 50 years. Kurdish officials said many of the refugees were injured in mustard gas attacks, but there was no official Turkish confirmation. Kurdish guerrillas are battling an estimated 60,000 Iraqi troops who are supported by tanks, artillery, fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships. The Iraqis launched a major offense Aug. 26 against the rebels. The guerrillas claimed the Iraqis have carried out scores of poison gas attacks in recent weeks against Kurdish villages and guerrilla bases. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied using chemical weapons, outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> treaty. The spokesman stressed that Kurdish `` resistance is continuing'' in the <LOCATION> Amadiyah </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sherwan </PERSON> regions. He said the guerrillas were trying to avoid set-piece battles with the heavily armed Iraqis and were ambushing military columns in coordinated hit-and-run attacks. He said guerrillas shot down four Iraqi helicopter gunships in the last few days and killed or wounded 7,000 government troops in recent fighting. Kurdish casualties were listed as 250 guerrillas and 1,900 civilians killed, with 5,000 civilians wounded. The spokesman said the Iraqis have not been able to seal off the border with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. This is the only escape route for civilians. In a separate statement, <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> denied press reports that he had sought asylum in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` Our decision is to remain with our beleaguered people ... and to continue our resistance for the survival of the Kurdish people.'' About 20 million Kurds lived in the mountainous region where the borders of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> meet. Kurdish rebels joined forces in November 1986 and launched an increasingly effective campaign against <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s intensified operations against the Kurds came after an Aug. 20 cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> took effect.

<HEAD>Former Policeman Releases Hostage, Ends 25-Hour Standoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former policeman convicted in a pension fund scandal surrendered after holding a police official hostage at gunpoint for 15 hours and then keeping authorities at bay for nearly 10 hours more. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, 39, claimed that he was willing to die to show he was innocent of involvement in a scheme to defraud the police pension fund. `` If I had been involved in something like that, I should n't go to jail, I should be shot,'' <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> said in an interview with a newspaper columnist shortly before he surrendered Sunday. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, who was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison, took <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, vice president of the city police board, hostage about 10:30 a.m. Saturday. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was free on bond pending appeal. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had been instrumental in exposing the kickback scheme that cost police and fire pension funds an estimated $ 330,000. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> formerly headed the police pension fund. Besides the prison sentence, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was ordered to make restitution of $ 200,000. He was one of six men indicted but the only one to stand trial; the others pleaded guilty to lesser charges. The ordeal began when <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> walked into <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s law office on the 15th floor of a downtown office building, displayed a .38 - caliber revolver and took <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> apparently wanted to convince <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> of his innocence and get media attention for what he regarded as an injustice in his conviction and sentence, officials said. The former policeman released <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> at about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. He ended the standoff at about 11 a.m. after reaching agreement with police that he would not be charged in the hostage-taking, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmeier </PERSON> said it was his decision not to prosecute <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>. But Circuit Attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said he had made no promises and would have to review the case before making a decision. Before surrendering, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> asked to speak to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> who had covered the police department and had written about the pension fund case. `` I should be hung. I wanted my brother officers to know I'm innocent I was willing to die to let them know it. I was willing to go out of here in a body bag,'' <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> told <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was taken to the medical facility at the federal penitentiary in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where he will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, authorities said. <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> was remorseful about the hostage-taking. Dozens of police officers and firefighters surrounded the office building during the standoff while a team of negotiators kept in touch with <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> by telephone from another floor of the building. Reports that <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> might have a bomb or had booby-trapped the door to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s office with explosives turned out to be false, police said. But the police team's work was complicated by the fact that <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, an 18-year police veteran and former rifleman on the hostage team, knew their techniques.

<TEXT>
 With solemn ceremony, opposition leaders today paid tribute to the thousands of `` martyrs of democracy'' killed by security forces attempting to quell the nationwide uprising against 26 years of one-party rule. About 50,000 people gathered in suburban <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on the west bank of <LOCATION> Inya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where opposition groups say police killed and brutally assaulted students during demonstrations March 17. Meanwhile, residents of a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb said today at least 20 people, including two <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, died during a confrontation between looters in a government biscuit factory and members of a `` vigilence committee.'' `` Vigilence committees'' are among the informal groups formed to maintain order and handle routine administration in areas where the government has been ineffective in wake of anti-government protests. Residents said members of the `` vigilence committee'' rushed to the biscuit factory Sunday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION> to stop a reported theft but instead were captured by the looters. Residents surged into the factory and, discovering eight members of the committee had been killed, set upon the thieves. The mob reportedly killed 12 people. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> printed what it said was an official directive to military intelligence agents and their informers. `` Under prevailing conditions in the country, intelligence units and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and confusion among the public,'' said the directive. A newsletter published by the students union said the directive was issued Aug. 22 by the head of military intelligence. The authenticity of the directive could not be independently verified. Some Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have speculated the government is trying to push the country toward anarchy to justify a military takeover. At least six armed officers identified as members of military intelligence were apprehended by protesters last month and reportedly acknowledged being ordered to carry out bombings and other sabotage to create chaos. Meanwhile, about 400 employees of the state radio and television _ the last major media under full official control _ went on strike today to protest the suspension of 14 colleagues. `` Our strike can greatly disrupt normal operations, but they can go on with a skeleton staff,'' strikers in the Information and <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The department has about 650 employees. The 14 officials were suspended for taking part in anti-government protests last month. The March violence inflamed a public already disillusioned with political repression and economic deterioration. Another major demonstration flared in June and unrest has continued over the past two months. `` My young sons and daughters whose names I had no chance to know,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, addressing the students killed in March. `` Your courage and sacrifice for the cause of democracy has been recognized, and you all will be remembered as martyrs of democracy both in the history of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and abroad.'' Referring to those killed by military forces last month, the retired general said: `` Thousands from various walks of life _ monks, students, workers, doctors and nurses _ have also followed you for the same cause.'' The opposition has called for a nationwide strike Thursday to press the government for immediate democracy rather than wait for a congress of the ruling party Sept. 12. President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has promised the congress would pave the way for a multi-party system after a referendum is held. `` The whole country has demanded immediate formation of an interim government to ease the situation. The government has to face the reality,'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> told visiting Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> later told reporters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was on the `` dawn of a new era of democracy'' but warned that hardline government and military moves could still cause a civil war. `` I do n't think it's an exaggeration to say that the fate of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> hangs in the balance,'' he said. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> suggested the exile of Ne Win, the military leader who seized power in 1962, and other top government leaders would help defuse the situation. Western diplomats say at least 100 people were killed in the March riots, while about 1,000 died last month in the capital following the retirement of Ne Win and his replacement by hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. Upon <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s accession to power, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and some of his associates were arrested and jailed. They were released when <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was replaced on Aug. 19 by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the first civilian leader in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in 26 years.

 Two cold fronts scattered rain in the eastern half of the nation today but most of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was hot and dry. A downtown temperature of 110 degrees tied the hottest day ever recorded in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was out from under tropical storm alerts and hail piled so deep in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> that a snowplow was put into service. Rainfall subsided in the deep South early today after as much as 5 inches of rain fell in sections of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> during the weekend. A tropical storm watch was canceled in the <LOCATION> Hawaiian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> as Hurricane Uleki moved westward away from the islands, weakening gradually. Hot, dry weather continued in much of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, with several record highs on Sunday. The 110-degree reading in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> tied a record set Sept. 1, 1955, the hottest day in the city's history. The temperature at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lindbergh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> reached 107 degrees, breaking a 1961 record for the date. A snowplow was dispatched to clear hail from three intersections as a Labor Day weekend storm deposited as much as 18 inches of the icy stuff on parts of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. Strong winds from the north later Sunday churned waves to an estimated 12 feet on the open waters of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, officials said. Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered ahead of a cold front over the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region; thunderstorms scattered across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; showers developing ahead of another cold front across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; cloudy to partly sunny skies over the Great Lakes states and upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; and for mostly sunny skies elsewhere.

<TEXT>
 Talks on a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases agreement broke off today after <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> negotiators announced the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base next to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> will be closed, the government said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said the American side asked that the talks be temporarily postponed following the Greek announcement. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation requested a temporary postponement in order to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and take relevant instructions from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities,'' <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said in a statement. The statement did not say when the talks would resume. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy spokesman could immediately be reached because of the Labor Day holiday. The postponement came on the opening day of a ninth round of negotiations for a new Greek-American defense cooperation agreement to replace a 1983 accord expiring in December. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government said last month that <ORGANIZATION> Hellenikon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> would be shut down. At that time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said its future was still under discussion. <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> is one of four American bases that have operated in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since the 1950s. It provides support for planes monitoring Soviet naval operations in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and for another three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here. About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700 Greeks work at the base, located next to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The Greek government has so far made no threat to close any other base, but says <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>'s operations can not be transferred to another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installation. There had been speculation here that a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Souda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the southern island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> could be expanded to replace <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>. The other American bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> are a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communicatons base at <LOCATION> Nea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Makri </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> which tracks Soviet naval and submarine activity and an electronic surveillance base at <LOCATION> Gournes </LOCATION>, also on <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. As a form of rent for the bases, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> receives $ 340 million annually in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military credits. Talks for the new defense cooperation agreement started last November but the regular monthly meetings have made little progress. The main obstacle appears to be Greek insistence that in return for a new bases agreement the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should help toward solving Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> and the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> also says a new agreement will be submitted for approval in a referendum before it takes effect. In July, the government issued a formal closure notice for all four bases, but it does n't necessarily mean the bases will stop operating. If the Greek and American negotiating teams fail to reach agreement, the current accord gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 17 months to dismantle the bases after the date the accord expires. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have said they would like to wrap up a new bases agreement by December. But the government spokesman warned again on Sunday that the talks are likely to be lenghty. `` We've said repeatedly the talks ca n't be quick and easy. We predict they will be long and painful,'' <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON> said in a statement.

<HEAD>50-Block Power Outage Ends In Downtown Seattle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Power was restored to all but one building today in a 50-block area of downtown that was left without electricity for three days by a fire in underground feeder cables. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> City Light workers completed repairs to a fifth 13,000-volt cable Sunday night, utility spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON> said. Repairs to the sixth and last burned out cable should be completed today, he said. Until the sixth cable is back in service, many buildings will have only partial power because they are served by a combination of the repaired and unrepaired cables, said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> of City Light. The last building without service was a parking garage with some office space near the fire site, <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON> said. Frozen food thawed, elevators would n't budge and air conditioners were useless during one of the hottest weeks in city history after service was cut Wednesday by a fire in an underground transformer and switching vault. About half the affected customers began getting power Saturday evening when the switch was thrown on four repaired feeder cables and other customers were hooked up during the night. The cause of the outage was undetermined but City Light superintendent <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said the fire apparently started in the municipal utility's cables. Power to those feeders should have been cut by current limiters that act when a cable gets hot. In addition, power continued flowing through an adjacent aluminum supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus lines. That cable melted, `` so what you had was molten aluminum cutting our cables'' <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said Sunday night. Had it not been for the lack of a power cutoff on the transit cable, <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> said, it would have been `` a two-building outage of a day or so.'' As power restoration began, fire crews roamed the area to make sure no fires were triggered in equipment left switched on when the outage began. `` It went very smoothly. I have no reports of problems other than the sprinker in the Battery Street tunnel,'' which apparently began wetting down the tunnel when it was tripped by the power surge, <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. `` We called the fire department and told them it was their problem.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Westin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, full service was restored to the 40-story south tower early Sunday, while the 47-story north tower remained on a diesel generator, rented for $ 6,200 a week, marketing director <PERSON> Dell </PERSON> <PERSON> Schooly </PERSON> said. City Light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power or repair damage, but <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said he understood the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would consider a special appropriation. During the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that 90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which has an estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place Market, the <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION> department store and uncounted hotels, grocery stores and taverns. The blackout coincided with a heat wave in which Friday's temperature was 98 degrees, a record for September, and Saturday's high 92, a record for the Sunday was in the low 80s.

<HEAD>Mail Strike Spreads In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of British postal workers were on strike today, halting some 100 million letters and parcels, in a work stoppage over regional bonuses and the hiring of temporary workers. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said more than 40,000 of its members in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> were striking Sunday and the whole system could be brought to a halt by midweek. The Post Office, which employs 140,000 people and handles 51 million items a day, said 28 major city center sorting offices were on strike, affecting 100 million letters and parcels. In affected areas, mail can not be collected, sorted or delivered. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> are among the affected cities. Overseas mail has almost stopped because the two sorting offices which handle it are on strike. The postal strike began Wednesday as a 24-hour walkout to protest regional pay bonuses _ an issue that remains unresolved. The strike has continued in various parts of the country to protest the bonuses and the hiring of temporary workers to clear the backlog of mail caused by Wednesday's strike. The union objects to the Post Office offering weekly bonuses of 7.5 pounds to 20 pounds -LRB- $ 12.52 to $ 33.40 -RRB- to recruit workers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Those regions are prosperous, and the postal service has difficulty hiring workers. The union said it would not tolerate regional pay differences and any bonuses should be paid nationally.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today celebrated Labor Day by denouncing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the leader of the party of the rich and asking voters to `` look in the mirror'' and ask whether they can afford four more years of Reagan-era indifference. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the workers' holiday that marks the traditional start of the fall presidential campaign, began the day visiting families in a working-class neighborhood of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and then headed for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and a rally in the auto capital with labor chieftains and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s Democratic leaders. Some 125 anti-abortion activists, by police estimates, staged a protest at his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> stop, waving signs and chanting, `` Life yes, abortion no. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of death must go.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, in his chat with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> residents, ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a ban on ocean dumping. `` I do n't think Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gets it. We want to stop ocean dumping, right? That means we've got to treat the sewage, right? ... But you ca n't be for an end to ocean dumping when you're also for ending federal grants for sewage treatment,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went up to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and said ` I'm for ending ocean dumping by 1991.' So am I. But how are we going to pay for it?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. He also hit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on housing, saying, `` I do n't think I've ever heard Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talk about housing, have you? ... He has n't. He does n't appreciate what average folks are going through.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in the text of his speech to the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> rally, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to help the `` privileged few'' get richer while making it harder for middle class families to send their children to college. `` The election is a choice etween two kinds of leadership, two ideas about prosperity and two visions of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` For the past seven years, as the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> told us this past week, the rich have gotten richer; the poor have gotten poorer; and those of us in the middle _ and that means most of us _ are getting squeezed. `` My friends, I ask you, can we afford four more years of that?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications to be vice president or president while praising his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as a leader who had proven his compassion by sheperding trade and plant-closing legislation through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And he lashed out at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to cut the capital gains tax, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said could give a $ 30,000 tax break to those making more than $ 200,000 a year. `` That's more than the average teacher makes,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's enough to send your son or daughter to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State for four years. The down payment young couples could use to buy their first home. `` And who do you think is going to pay for that new tax break?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` Look at your kids. Look at your parents. Look in the mirror and ask yourself, can we afford four more years of that?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to task for calling the rise in national unemployment reported last week `` statistically irrelevant.'' `` That's an interesting phrase,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But not surprising, coming as it did from the standard bearer of the party that thought ketchup was a vegetable. My friends, we're here today to tell Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that Americans are not statistics, and we sure are n't irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Dukais </PERSON> recalled his Saturday trip with his immigrant mother to <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and paid tribute to the nation's ethnic diversity. `` We are a wonderful and diverse mosaic of races and creeds and ethnic groups bound together by our love for this country; by our belief in its future; and by our deep and abiding faith in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said. `` And if anyone tells you that that dream belongs to the privileged few, and not to all of us, tell them that their era is over and a new era is about to begin.'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> were joining <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> rally, as were Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> and Sens. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>. From there <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to join <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and a host of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> state and local officials at a Labor Day barbecue.

<HEAD>Police Say Moslem Cleric To Be Indicted On Incitement Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police said today they plan to indict a Moslem cleric on incitement charges for allegedly urging worshipers to fight Jews working at an archaeological dig near two sacred mosques in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, or <LOCATION> Waqf </LOCATION>, would be the highest-ranking Moslem official to be tried by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since it captured east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has jailed at least 20 Moslem officials, including preachers, teachers and mosque guards. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> told the The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` What I did is not incitement. It is the right of Moslems to come to their holy place and defend it. I would do this again.'' The cleric also threatened to `` make trouble'' if he was taken to court, but he did not elaborate. At issue were clashes July 3 in which riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians enraged by the archaeological dig near the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, known in Arabic as <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> esh-Sharif </PERSON>. The mount houses two of Islam's holiest shrines, the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> and Dome of the Rock mosques. Using mosque loudspeakers, Moslem officials urged Palestinians to rush to the site and defend the shrines, saying Israelis planned to dig a tunnel to the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials denied the charges, saying the dig was designed to open an underground staircase running along the Western Wall, <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest site. The Western Wall, the last remnant of the Second Temple, borders the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Officials today reported no progress in the 12th day of U.N.-sponsored talks on ending the Iran-Iraq war. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Gastaut </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> first met late Sunday with the Iraqi side, minus Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, and then this morning with the Iranians, likewise without Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>. While results remain elusive, `` Work is continuing,'' she said. The Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers have not met since the second day of the talks. On Saturday, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> described the talks as `` still in square one.'' Meanwhile, foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met today for a second day in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, for discussions focused on breaking the deadlock in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The council members are <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sharq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Awsat </ORGANIZATION> newspaper today quoted council sources as saying members of the security and economic alliance in the oil-rich <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region `` are serious about entering as indirect partners in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiations, even if it's in the final stages.'' The problems that have bogged down the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks include troop withdrawals, freedom of navigation, border questions and the status of the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the sea. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has also called for an inquiry to establish who started the war, one of the provisions of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which is the basis for the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks. Fighting halted Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of fighting when a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> unconditionally accepted <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598 calling for a truce. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says the war started Sept. 22, 1980, when Iraqi troops invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Heavyweight boxing champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was recuperating today from minor head and chest injuries after apparently being knocked out in a single-car accident near his upstate training camp. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> apparently skidded on a wet road Sunday morning, said a spokesman for the boxer, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>, who gave no other details of the crash. A witness said the accident occurred while <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was driving his car out of the yard at his adopted family's home in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> and it skidded and slammed into a tree. He was found, apparently unconscious. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> was just leaning back in his car seat and I took his pulse,'' said <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, a niece of <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has been close to since he began training in <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> eight years ago. `` He was normal, his breathing was n't heavy or labored. I did n't hear anything wrong with him We just could n't arouse him. We tried to wake him up by asking ` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>,' and we just could n't get anything from him,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON> said, `` had -LRB- the car -RRB- parked on the grass side of the driveway. It was very squishy there because of the rain and the wheels kept spinning around, chewing into the dirt. He finally got it going and it skidded straight into a tree, bounced off and went into some shrubbery sideways.'' `` When I opened the car door, his head was slumped backward. I slapped him on the cheek to wake him. He opened his eyes, and said, ` <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, <PERSON> Camille </PERSON>, what happened?' Then he went out again,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and his trainer, <PERSON> Cus </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, lived at <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON>'s house for several years while the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> teen-ager was learning to box. He returns to the house regularly to visit <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON>, who is 83. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who was recovering from a broken bone in his right hand suffered in a street fight two weeks ago with heavyweight <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, was taken to two upstate hospitals before being transferred Sunday night to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here. <PERSON> Ewald </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, and his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, wanted <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> taken to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hospital. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> was hospitalized for observation and diagnostic tests, said Dr. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION>. `` He suffered minor trauma to the head and the chest wall,'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s condition was stable. `` He's neurologicallly normal.'' When <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> tried to keep waiting photographers away from her husband. As cameramen pressed forward, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> pushed them back, shouting, `` Give him a break.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, whose championship bout against British champ <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> was recently postponed until Oct. 22 because of the hand injury, was scheduled to accompany his wife to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In his last fight in the ring on June 27, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> knocked out previously unbeaten <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> in 91 seconds, earning $ 22 million. It was not known whether the car accident would affect <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s next fight <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s manager, said the cast on the fighter's right hand was removed on Thursday and a splint was placed on it

 The confirmed death toll rose to 18 today as emergency crews worked to open roads and deliver supplies to communities isolated by flooding after two hurricanes, officials said. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION>, citing preliminary reports, said 27 people died. Much of the southern half of the country was affected by hurricanes <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> _ from <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> on the east to the west coast resorts and <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> on the border with <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Officials said most of the victims were killed in mudslides or were swept away by swollen rivers. An estimated 50,000 people were evacuated from their homes. Hurricane Debby struck on Friday. <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> affected the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast for several days, but never hit land and moved out to sea. In <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>, about 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 25,000 people were left homeless, state government spokesman <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said Sunday. As many as 10,000 residents of <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> were forced to leave their homes, <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said He said three people died in the town of <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and three in nearby <LOCATION> Papantla </LOCATION>. In the central state of <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, a mudslide crushed three houses in the mountain community of <LOCATION> Ixtlahuaco </LOCATION>, about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing four people and injuring 16 others, according to 2nd Commander <PERSON> Florencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. Three people died while picking corn and tending cattle close to the banks of flooding rivers in the southern state of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Peregrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Villagomez </PERSON>, assistant public security director. On the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, five people died in <LOCATION> Tapachula </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION> state at the border with <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, when the <LOCATION> Coatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed, said <PERSON> Virignia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorantes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman there. She said aid was being distributed to those forced to evacuate, but did not know how many were affected. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said about 20,000 were evacuated in the state. Officials said road crews were clearing mud from roads. Rain continued to drench the gulf coast and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast from the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> south to <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> this morning, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Streets in parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> flooded, choking rush hour traffic today on some thoroughfares. Traffic was moving slowly after 56 mudslides covered a road between <LOCATION> Pachuca </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Huejutla </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. A cracked bridge immobilized traffic for 15 hours over the weekend on the Pan-American highway near the city of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>, 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said. By late Sunday, automobile traffic had resumed, he said. Tourists were stranded in the resort of <LOCATION> Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo </LOCATION>, where the airport was flooded and the road south to <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> and north to <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was closed to traffic, hotel owners reported. They said <LOCATION> Ixtapa </LOCATION> was left without electricity, and some hotels ran out of emergency candles.

<TEXT>
 With the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> kicked off his fall campaign today with a tribute to the Pledge of Allegiance and a declaration that the values it embodies `` are not hokey or cornball.'' `` The people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> want to know the kind of values that underscore our beliefs, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I proudly and unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of Allegiance,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee said. The Republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the campaign, attacking Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his 1977 veto of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have penalized teachers who refused to lead their classes in the pledge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited an advisory opinion by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' highest court that the bill was unconstitutional, as well as a 1943 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that students could not be forced to salute the flag. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that `` the same mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance ... could well sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of the values and standards upon which we must rely.'' For him and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, the spirit and values of the pledge `` deserve to be transmitted to our children.'' `` To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the statue stands in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, to kick off his fall campaign on this Labor Day holiday. He also toured neighboring <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where millions of immigrants entered the country. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech was briefly disrupted by a group of demonstrators who chanted, `` Forty-thousand dead from AIDS! Where was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s supporters surrounded the group and began a counter-chant, yelling, `` We want <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' As the protesters were hustled away, the senator told his audience, `` I believe in freedom of speech. They have a right to freedom of speech, but so do I.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also travels to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for an ethnic parade before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to regroup for the heavy campaigning to come. On Sunday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ended a five-day Southern swing and his second week of solo campaigning as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee. `` The South is going for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declared in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> as several hundred supporters cheered. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was generally well received during his foray into the South, a region with strong Democratic registration but which has been Republican territory in presidential contests. But there was a smattering of boos Sunday when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was introduced to <ORGANIZATION> NASCAR </ORGANIZATION> racing fans in <LOCATION> Darlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and there continue to be small protests at some of his other appearances. It was a week that saw further refinement of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s themes of jobs, peace and prosperity and the emergence of his new fall rhetoric: `` defeatist liberal'' policies of the Democrats versus the `` enlightened can-do conservatism'' of the Republicans. It was also a week that saw a profusion of photo opportunities for which <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategists believe <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is particularly suited. He relished tossing a football with high school players, for example, and turned it into a metaphor for his campaign. His `` lousy'' passing got better, he noted, just like his own political performance. The controversies about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military service, personal life and academic record for the most part did not follow him on this trip. And <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> apparently has become more relaxed with the press, as has his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, who has blamed the media for blowing the controversies out of proportion. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> still has problems at news conferences, aides concede. He told reporters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that he supported a gradual rise in the minimum wage and then appeared not to know that his position was different from that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who opposes an increase in the minimum wage. And he criticized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for what he said was a reluctance to promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports aggressively, but declined to say in what instances the department had failed. Aides said later he was just being cautious, unwilling to get into specifics from memory.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, visiting a small business center on Labor Day, today accused Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of neglecting the needs of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and the oil industry he once worked in. The Democratic vice presidential nominee, starting a cross-country Labor Day trek in his home state, told 250 supporters, `` They've sort of turned their backs on us, this administration has.'' Speaking outside a former high school converted with government and <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> funds into the Business Resource Center, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Republicans `` have an oilman who's running for president. But frankly I ca n't remember anything he's done for the energy industry in the past eight years.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> toured the business center and met with local citizens trying to revive the struggling economy here in this central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town. He said the start up of new business was important because <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> `` very much needs that kind of diversification.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator then planned to fly to <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to speak at a Labor Day picnic, before journeying on to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and a joint Labor Day picnic with his running mate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said that in a new campaign speech crafted last week while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was on vacation, the candidate would sound the Democrats' campaign themes of economic patriotism and fairness. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is stopping in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on nearly every campaign trip, fighting to win the state and its 29 electoral votes for the Democrats even though Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also calls it home. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> planned to launch new television spots in the state this week with the message, `` You ca n't afford to vote Republican,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. Under an unusual <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also is running for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat, which he has held for three terms. That campaign already has aired advertisements. After his two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> stops, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was flying this afternoon to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where he was meeting up with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> picnic. Missouri is also a battleground, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> already had visited the city twice since being picked for the ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s two-day trip was then picking up the job creation theme on Tuesday with visits to a job training center in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, outside of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that night. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> on Sunday after spending four days relaxing at a friend's ranch in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> played tennis, rode horses and went fishing, his staff said.

<HEAD>Labor Federation Expels Electricians' Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly today to expel the electricians' union, its first ouster of an affiliate in 15 years. Delegates of the electricians' 336,000-member union showed their disdain by walking out en masse minutes before the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> took its vote. The vote, by a show of hands, came on the opening morning of the Trades Union's week-long annual conference in this south <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> seaside resort. The Electronic, <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was ousted for signing two single-union no-strike deals with management in violation of Trades Union policy. More than 30 single-union no-strike deals have been struck in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, with one union representing all the workers at a plant and disputes submitted to binding arbitration. The Trades Union believes such deals weaken union bargaining power and lead to competition among unions for representation in a shrinking job market. Some predicted the expulsion would create a ripple effect, confronting the 9-million member national labor federation with what <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> called the `` most serious split in British trade union history.'' It also raised the prospect of the electricians and other rebellious unions forming a rival labor federation. Among those siding with the electricians' union is the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s second biggest affiliate. Delegates shouted down engineers' leader <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and the microphone was cut off when he urged a postponement of the electricians' expulsion, saying it would inflict `` grievous bodily harm.'' Electricians' leader <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, in a defiant final speech to the conference before the vote, accused left-wing unions of conspiring to bring about the expulsion, spoke of `` witch hunts'' and portrayed his union as a <PERSON> David </PERSON> fighting a Goliath. Trades Union General Secretary <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, addressing the representatives of the 85 affiliate unions, denied any witch hunt and said the electricians' union had refused every opportunity to scrap the no-strike deals. The electricians' union was suspended July 8 after accepting no-strike deals at two plants in <LOCATION> Lancashire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Today's vote converted the suspension to outright expulsion. In the last expulsion in 1973, 10 unions were ousted for refusing to oppose government legislation on industrial relations. Eight of the unions rejoined the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> after the legislation was repealed.

 To protect themselves from Palestinian stone-throwers, Jewish settlers operate a radio warning system and community patrols and even train bus operators to shoot while driving. Many settlers are dissatisfied with army security and their anger has grown along with the number of Palestinian attacks on their settlements during the 9-month-old uprising, which has killed four Israelis and nearly 260 Arabs. On Sunday, 200 settlers protested outside government offices where the Cabinet was discussing whether to allow them to open fire more freely on the stone-throwers. Authorities have said civilians may open fire only when their lives are in imminent danger. Military jeeps escort local buses on their way through Palestinian towns and refugee camps, sites of frequent rock-throwing attacks, and soldiers patrol the areas. But many residents say present defenses are not enough and have set up their own forms of protection. A radio attack warning center that covers 15 settlements with a population of 10,000 is housed in the basement of the regional council in <LOCATION> Gush </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Etzion </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Shilo </LOCATION> Gal, chairman of the council. The center is staffed round-the-clock by reserve soldiers, most of whom are local residents. Small settlements are guarded by one or two armed settlers, while larger communities are patrolled by jeeps with sirens and radios, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlers' spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> showed how Jewish bus drivers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are being taught self-defense, including driving around roadblocks, helping passengers to jump through bus windows during a firebomb attack and caring for the wounded. The program showed bus drivers firing pistols from moving vehicles and trying to drive without flinching while tennis balls were thrown at their windshield to simulate rock attacks. <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> said the windows of the buses are being covered with metal grills. `` We ca n't trust the army and it wo n't allow us to protect ourselves and our children,'' said <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Maler </PERSON> of the Teqoa settlement. `` Last Friday, we had to wait for 45 minutes for the escort. We returned to the bus station, called the army and waited for another 45 minutes. Not one of us had a gun.'' Meanwhile, soldiers `` just stand around, look at stone-throwers and smoke cigarettes,'' said the Soviet-born <PERSON> Maler </PERSON>, who moves around with an army-issued M-16 rifle. Some of the other settlers carry pistols. Some legislators have expressed concern that settlers given a green light to fire on stone-throwers would shoot indiscriminately. The debate was heightened after a settler accidentally shot and wounded two soldiers last week when he opened fire at a Palestinian who threw a firebomb that missed his car. But Shilo Gal says the settlers must rely on government patrols and organized defenses. `` We can not do more because people would accuse us of forming militias,'' he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> hopes to visit <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> this month and told a visiting <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister he sought better ties between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country, aides said today. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spoke in a meeting with the president of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>, the highest ranking Hungarian to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations with the Jewish state 21 years ago. <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>, who arrived Sunday for a four-day visit, told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> he hoped the two countries could renew ties `` when the situation allows,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. The Hungarian leader said Sunday his trip signalled the start of a process that could lead to a resumption of diplomatic ties. `` This is a first step and it will be followed by others,'' he told reporters. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> resumed low-level diplomatic ties last year and opened interest offices in March. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the prime minister hoped to visit <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> later this month but that final plans had not been made. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> invited <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to avoid appearing to be meddling in Israeli politics, in light of a visit to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in May by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the radio said. In their meeting, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also praised <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s `` sympathetic and positive'' attitude toward its Jewish community, said a statement from the prime minister's office <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> today visited the Yad Vashem memorial to 6 million Jews slain by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II and told reporters, `` We must all ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> pledged on Monday that it will not disrupt the Olympic Games and said any incident marring the Games would be part of a U.S.-South Korean plot to create an excuse to invade the North. `` If anything happens in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Olympic Games, it will have nothing to do with us and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities themselves should be held responsible for it,'' the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` We hereby make it clear that we do not have the slightest intention to obstruct the progress of the Games or threaten them by force of arms,'' said the statement, carried by the state-run -LRB- North -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It said various military exercises planned by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were designed to create tension on the troubled Korean peninsula and provide an excuse for an invasion of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The joint maneuvers and exercises are designed to `` cause a shocking incident and start another war in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in case the Games do not go as they -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- wish,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and is planning to station naval ships off the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula during the Games to deter any attacks from outside. The games open Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Japanese naval and coast guard ships will patrol waters between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to prevent smuggling of weapons, and some of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces involved in the exercises are based in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Korean <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> called the moves `` reckless military rackets'' which `` are a very dangerous play with fire which aggravates the situation and increases the danger of war in this region.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has announced it will not participate in the Olympics because <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have conspired to use the Games to divide the troubled Korean peninsula permanently. `` If we go to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for the Olympic Games under such circumstances it will be tantamount to recognizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists' occupation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and colonial rule ... to perpetuate our nation's division,'' said <PERSON> Rodong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinmun </PERSON>, the official newspaper of the North's communist <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate commentary on Monday. The North, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s archrival since the 1950-53 Korean War, demanded to co-host the Games, but the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused, saying each Olympiad is awarded to only one city. In another development, a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> news agency reported that North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s second son was recently appointed ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to avoid a possible leadership threat to his older brother. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday quoted unidentified Japanese government officials as saying <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, 34, was director-general of the North Korean people's armed forces bureau before being named ambassador. It quoted unidentified Eastern European sources as saying <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s oldest son and designated successor, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, 46, was having problems dealing with the nation's stagnant economy and the controversy over the Games. Because of <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>'s leadership problems, the sources said, people were beginning to favor <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Americans Help Bring Order to Liberia's Financial Chaos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite initial skepticism, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are pleased with an experiment in which 17 American financial experts moved into <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> government offices to bring order to the African nation's chaotic financial system. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, a country founded by freed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> slaves a century and a half ago, has always had a special relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> turned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1987 after his fiscal problems ran out of control. Corruption was rampant, government checks were bouncing, civil servants were being paid months late and bureaucrats were spending money without regard to budgetary limits. Some government contractors were not paid for work performed while others received checks they were not entitled to. In January, 1987, when Secetary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made a brief stop in <LOCATION> Monrovia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> told him, `` I need help.'' The two countries worked out a plan to put American accountants, systems managers and computer experts _ recruited by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> _ inside the <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> bureaucracy. The `` operational experts'' _ nicknamed `` Opex'' _ assumed their duties in January. Nine of the 17 went to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's worked reasonably well,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, summing up the eight-month-old experiment. `` The benefits have been considerable already.'' The official, who insisted on anonymity, said the two-year program `` has exceeded the expectations of a lot of people who thought it would never get off the ground.'' Among other benefits, civil servants are now being paid on time, he said. Another official, also speaking anonymously, said, `` Before there was no government budget. Everything was entirely ad hoc. Opex has gotten the Liberians to adhere to the budget. It's under pretty good control but there are still some financial flows outside the budget.'' With the Americans co-signing checks and taking over much of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s economic management, the plan gives the appearance of a Liberian surrender of sovereignty in a key area, which is a complaint voiced by Liberian opposition leaders. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> still has the final say on all financial matters. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> may be the only country where it would be politically possible for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to play such an intrusive role. But <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, with its red, white and blue flag and its use of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as legal tender, has always looked on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a friend and patron. The financial crisis can be traced back about 10 years when the <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> government decided to build a $ 200 million convention center it could n't afford. The country fell deeply into debt, and the problems were compounded in 1980 when <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, then a 28-year-old sergeant, took power in a military coup, bringing with him a team of advisers with no government experience. As prices of <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s principal exports fell, foreign exchange earnings dropped. Eventually, because of a poor debt repayment record, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> declared <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> ineligible for new loans. Now, as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials describe it, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s future seems brighter, and not only because of Opex. Human rights violations are down, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s press is once again one of the freest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and there is increased demand for international demand for latex, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>'s major export. Concern about AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ has touched off a boom in sales of latex products, such as condoms and gloves, contributing to the more upbeat mood these days among Liberians.

<HEAD>Labor, Likud Platforms Call for Direct Talks with Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Both major parties have modified their national election platforms to include support for talks with Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied territories. It is `` a major amendment'' for the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, but Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political alliance has little choice because `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> does not appear presently to be a partner for negotiations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said in an interview. The center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s new platform also represents a major shift from its customary position that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should negotiate with <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians should be represented in a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> delegation. Labor is led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> forced the platform changes by announcing July 31 that he would end legal and administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the Israeli-occupied lands where 1.5 million Palestinians and 68,000 Jewish settlers live. An uprising against Israeli rule began in the territories Dec. 8. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, a peace activist and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> candidate for parliament, said this week the king's decision was a message to <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> and Palestinians `` to make up your minds'' on resolving problems in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Another reason for the platform changes appears to be <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s desire to pre-empt any <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> effort to assume <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s role in the territories <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984 because neither party won a majority that year in the 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament. How to resolve the conflict with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> has become a central factor in each side's effort to win control in the election Nov. 1. The uprising, in which nearly 260 Palestinians have been killed, is the most sustained revolt to date against Israeli occupation and lends extra urgency to the campaign. Four Israelis also have been slain. In the past, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> linked criteria for peace talks to the U.S.-brokered Camp David agreement of 1978, which led to the 1979 peace treaty between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The agreement called for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to negotiate an autonomous <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> government in the occupied lands, with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> joining later talks on a final resolution. Negotiations between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ended in 1981 and neither the Palestinians nor <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states considers the Camp David process a viable option. <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, helped draft the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> platform and said `` there is no role for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist group, but dovish <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members appear to be reconsidering that position. <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> candidate, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week: `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> accepts <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, abandons the ways of terror and recognizes the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, it wo n't be the same entity. Once it is not the same entity it will make me reconsider my attitude toward it.'' Those resolutions guarantee <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist within secure borders in return for its withdrawal from occupied Arab territory. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has moved in recent months to modify its stance toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and, perhaps, win world support for a role in governing the occupied lands. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, has advocated recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and establishing an independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the territories. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has become a campaign issue. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador and a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> candidate for parliament, said this week: `` The public is concerned about the problem of staying in the territories, but it is significantly more concerned about the vulnerability we will invite on ourselves if we get out of the territories.'' He said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> control of the occupied lands might threaten <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by providing a `` front door'' for invasion, and such weapons as shoulder-fired missiles could threaten all Israeli air strips. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the uprising should be ended, followed by a `` cooling-off period'' and an autonomy plan that gives <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maximum security and the Arab residents minimum interference.

 The younger brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> was sentenced Monday to seven years in prison and fined $ 4.4 million dollars for embezzling millions of dollars during <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s administration. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-hwan </PERSON> was sentenced by a three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which also found 11 of his accomplices guilty of similar charges and gave them prison terms ranging from one to three years. Six other people were given suspended terms of up to 1 -LCB- years and freed. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-hwan </PERSON>, 46, was convicted of diverting more than $ 10 million in official funds, taking bribes and abusing power to make illegal profits. `` The defendants deserve stern punishment for taking personal profits by abusing power,'' said Senior Judge Park Young-moo in rendering the verdict. The judge said, `` The defendant, as the younger brother of the then president who upheld the realization of a society of justice, actually did what was contrary to that.'' `` It is our belief that the defendant should not be given lenient treatment because of his relation to the ex-president. Likewise, he also should not be punished excessively, simply because he is the younger brother of an unpopular president,'' he said. The younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was convicted for using his position as head of the semi-official Saemaul -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- development group to embezzle official funds, extort contributions from businesses and peddle government influence. The prosecution had demanded a 15-year term for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> took bribes and embezzled millions while he headed Saemaul from 1981 to 1987. He was accused of using the money for stock and land speculation. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who wore traditional white Korean clothing and prisoners' rubber shoes, appeared calm while the judge read a lengthy statement on the court's decision After a one-hour hearing, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and the other defendants were led to a bus to be sent back to prison as guards held off jeering protesters. Under Korean law, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and the other defendants have one week to appeal their cases for trial by a higher court. Court sources said both the defendants and the prosecution are expected to appeal the sentences. In his final testimony, the younger <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> said he did nothing wrong and claimed that he was being used as a political scapegoat. He emerged from obsecurity to head the Saemaul program one year after his brother seized power with military backing in 1980. The former president and his family have come under public fire for alleged involvement in major financial scandals. A parliamentary investigative committee recently demanded the ex-president and 15 members of his family be forbidden to leave the country while an investigation into alleged corruption is under way. The government imposed a foreign travel ban on some suspects, but declined to limit the former president's movements. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has also blocked opposition attempts to make the former president testify before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Following massive anti-government protest, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> stepped down at the end of a seven-year term in February to be replaced by President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who won presidential elections over rival opposition candidates in December.

 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law went on trial today charged with taking $ 1 million in bribes in a court case expected to expose corruption in the highest Kremlin circles. If convicted, he could face death by firing squad. The trial of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, 51, a former first deputy interior minister, is in line with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to break with the cronyism and corruption now seen as endemic under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief from 1964 until his death in 1982. The case against <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and eight co-defendants, being heard by a three-member military tribunal of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, may also have a political aim _ to discredit remaining members of the Kremlin Old Guard who flourished under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, or to signal that their time has passed. As the reading of the charges began, a court officer said that, `` abusing his official position, -LRB- <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> -RRB- repeatedly took bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic that has been the center of the corruption scandal. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-level <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job in 1961, was accused of accepting bribes totaling 656,883 rubles -LRB- $ 1.04 million -RRB-, some of them from co-defendants. That sum is the equivalent of 270 years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> also was accused of accepting a carpet, tea sets, wine, cognac, grapes and pomegranates that reportedly were flown to him from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. During the reading of the charges, it was repeatedly alleged that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> received the bribes due to his connection with <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, and at one point a co-defendant was quoted as telling investigators he gave <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> money because `` he was a very influential man.'' <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> is `` an example of the ` stagnation period,' when a person reached high position not because of his merits but due to his family connections,'' the party daily newspaper Pravda said last week. `` Glasnost and democracy will help to avoid Churbanovism and anything similar to it,'' Pravda said. Court opened at 10 a.m. with <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and the others sitting in the dock guarded by five young soldiers from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Access to the courtroom was limited, with only a few foreign reporters permitted to attend. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the eyes of the senior guardsman, in his 20s, `` open wide each time the figure of another bribe is mentioned.'' The dark-haired <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, dressed in a gray jacket and collarless black shirt, was pale, but stared straight ahead, his head held high. Asked by the presiding judge, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marov </PERSON>, to stand and identify himself, <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> spoke in a barely audible voice. When he said he was a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, <PERSON> Marov </PERSON> asked him if he had been expelled, and <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> answered, `` In connection with the present case.'' <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON>, accused the prosecutor, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Sboyev </PERSON>, of prejudicing the case against the accused in an Aug. 14 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News article. In an interview published last week by the same newspaper, <PERSON> Makarov </PERSON> said some <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media have made <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> a scapegoat for all the ills of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era, and that the accounts give him the impression `` that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> is being tried under the name of <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>.'' The trial is expected to last at least six weeks. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> in 1971, is on trial with eight former <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials also accused of taking bribes: Interior Minister <PERSON> Khaidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, 61, his deputies <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Begelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakhramanov </PERSON>, and regional police chiefs identified only as <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabirov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norbutaev </PERSON>, <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzhamalov </PERSON>, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norov </PERSON> and Ya. <PERSON> Makhamadzhanov </PERSON>. The trial's first day ended dramatically at 6 p.m. when <PERSON> Norbutaev </PERSON>, who had complained earlier of feeling ill, suffered an apparent heart attack. <PERSON> Norbutaev </PERSON> clutched his chest and writhed in pain as two doctors administered to him. The judge then adjourned the session until Tuesday. According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with the government made to pay for the non-existent crop by corrupt officials including <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>, who died in 1983. `` Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more than 4 billion rubles -LRB- $ 6.34 billion -RRB- from the state, half of which they stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda reported earlier this year. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who held the rank of colonel general in the Moscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcement, was a power-hungry epicure who became a key actor in shielding the racket, Pravda claimed. Officials announced <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>'s arrest in February 1987. He was fired from his top-level <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job in 1984, but reportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administration for the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said last week that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> may get the death penalty if convicted because he is charged with serious economic crimes. People sentenced to death by Soviet courts are shot by a firing squad.

 Better or otherwise, this mousetrap uses neither springs nor poison. If that does n't strike your fancy, how about a kit for making your own four-seater plane? Could you use a few dozen cow gallstones? All this and more can be found in a federal government catalogue designed to help peddle <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods around the world. Among the other novelties listed in the monthly publication `` Commercial News USA'' is a machine for making miniature doughnuts. And there's genuine Kiowa Indian beef jerky. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> sends 110,000 copies every month to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missions in 140 countries, but does not distribute them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The magazine has an index in French and Spanish as well as English and some missions translate the entire issue. The Foreign Agricultural Service of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> takes inquiries from other countries and makes them available through computer information networks to Americans with farm products to sell. Some are published in the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, a business daily in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Earlier in the 1980s, the inquiries included such exotic items as the cow gallstones _ for use in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> medicine _ as well as four-leaf clovers and turtle eggs. `` Foreign Agriculture,'' published monthly by the department, says it does not know what the clover and turtle eggs were for. It quotes <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, one of the department's marketing specialists, as saying it now prefers to concentrate on more mundane products like wheat, wood, beef and poultry. Last year, the countries with the most requests were <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Manufacturers pay $ 150 to get a small black-and-white photo and a brief description of their product in `` Commercial News <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' The miniature doughnut machine, called `` Lil' Orbits,'' is considered one of the magazine's success stories. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebner </PERSON>, its program director, said in an interview that its mention in the magazine brought $ 600,000 worth of business for the manufacturer in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. He had visits from interested agents in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and negotiations with a Japanese distributor. The mousetrap works this way: The mouse crawls in to get the bait, tips the trap and causes the door to lock behind it. It costs 42 to 50 cents wholesale and can be either reused or thrown away with the mouse inside. The do-it-yourself airplane kit costs $ 40,000. The manufacturer claims the resulting plane, when put together from the instructions that come with it, has a cruising speed of 200 miles an hour, a range of 1,000 miles and a useful load of 850 pounds. Beef jerky is marinated, dried meat in thin pieces about an inch wide. The word comes from the Quechua Indians in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, but the version now being exported is made by a Kiowa Indian from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON>. He sold a contract to <ORGANIZATION> Harrods </ORGANIZATION> department store in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> after being helped by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to exhibit at a British food show. `` It goes well with beer,'' said <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, of the High Value Products Division at the service. `` They drink a lot of beer over there.'' <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON> won an award from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` National Minority Business Person of the Year,'' but then he got into trouble with British health authorities who disapproved of the quality of the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> water used to prepare the beef before it was dried. `` That's all right now,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Harrods is selling it again and he's talking with the Japanese.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leadership has stamped a showcase drug-fighting bill `` bipartisan,'' and is trying to secure <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> support by permitting votes on conservative-inspired issues like the death penalty. The strategy, devised by Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, could produce an overwhelming majority for legislation that incumbents from both parties could use in their election races. Debate begins Wednesday, and a final vote could take place Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will then follow with its own drug bill and the two versions would eventually be merged into final legislation. The bipartisan approach could blunt any Republican plans to paint Democrats as soft on crime _ a theme already sounded by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I do n't think being tough on drugs means Republicans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., `` Many Democrats feel just as strongly as Republicans, because we think it's right. House Republicans, on the other hand, wo n't have to rant and rave as they often do that Democrats use the rules to keep <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposals from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes. They'll have guaranteed votes on amendments that advance their political agenda. Many Democrats may join them in some votes. The key issues will be a federal death penalty, denial of federal benefits and state driver's licenses to drug users, and a `` good faith'' exception to admit illegally seized drug evidence. The House bill as introduced carries a $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion annual pricetag, money that would be added to the $ 3.9 billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug abuse. The legislation includes something for everyone involved in fighting illegal drugs: more money for education, treatment and rehabilitation; and more resources for state and local law enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land, in the air and on the seas. But there also are new twists, such as controlling the U.S.-made chemicals that find their way to foreign cocaine laboratories, and old controversies, like gun control. The bill contains a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchasers that has become the latest cause for both the gun owner and pro-regulation groups. Gun control organizations argue that a national waiting period would make it more difficult for drug dealers to obtain handguns, mainly in the 28 states that now have no waiting period. Pro-gun organizations protest that only law-abiding citizens would be harmed by the delay, because criminals would not go to legitimate dealers. The key <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> amendments would: _ Provide a mandatory death penalty against those who commit murder in the course of a federal drug felony One liberal Democratic alternative calls for mandatory life imprisonment. _ Allow admission in court of improperly seized drug evidence if law enforcement officers acted in `` good faith. _ Deny student loans, <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> mortgages, rent subsidies and other federal benefits to convicted drug users until they complete rehabilitation programs After rehabilitation, benefits would be reinstated. Another GOP-sponsored amendment, which some Republicans oppose, would require the revocation or suspension of a driver's license for those convicted of a drug-related offense. Federal money would be withheld from states to force compliance. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select committee on narcotics, said he does n't care much for the bipartisan approach. `` Once the leadership said ` bipartisan,' the Republicans wanted these draconian measures,'' he said. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said that for conservatives, `` the litmus test for commitment is the federal death penalty.'' The death penalty now is applied only for state crimes, because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not adopted the constitutional standards required to carry out capital punishment. However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> predicted that many Democrats would back the death penalty and suggested the main party split would come over the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan to deny benefits to drug users. To address complaints from local officials who said they never received promised anti-drug grants, the bill would require states to automatically pass through anti-drug money to local governments. Banking law revisions would allow the government to closely watch institutions where drug money might be laundered. Recipients of federal grants or contracts would need to maintain a drug-free workplace. Money would be provided for drug education, treatment and rehabilitation for AIDS victims and groups with a high risk of getting the disease. The legislation would authorize $ 10 million for a Latin American regional anti-drug force if one is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Congress Expected To Pass Legislation To Combat Medical Waste</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With uncharacteristic speed, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected in its final weeks to create a new law to combat what has become one of the biggest and most emotional problems of the summer of'88 _ medical waste that has invaded and shut down some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite beaches. Intense pressure from outraged citizens has driven <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to hold a series of public hearings, including one this week on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and at least one measure and maybe more will be passed before the legislative year ends, lawmakers and environmental activists predicted. Separate measures to create a waste tracking system and to establish specific criminal penalties for medical waste dumping passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before the August recess. Similar measures are pending in various House committees. `` With all the publicity this has gotten, these will sail right through,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Catena </PERSON>, a science policy analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a national environmental group that focuses on coastal problems. `` The fact that you had one of the hottest summers in 50 years and tens of millions of people ... were unable to make use of the public beaches really drew the issue right home,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a Democrat who represents part of the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> coast along the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, said another reason for the unusual speed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is the clarity of the issue. `` There's no reputable other side of the issue,'' said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. `` No one can excuse the presence of medical waste in the ocean and the only way it can get there is from illegal dumping. ... There's not a lot of technical debate here We know what we can do. Let's do it. Environmentalists concede that the medical waste problem poses much less of a long-term health threat than other issues plaguing the nation's coastal waters, such as sludge dumping, that have languished in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for years. `` In terms of long-term survival of the ocean, it's not a serious problem. In terms of impact on people's lives, it is,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, another activist group. <ORGANIZATION> Catena </ORGANIZATION> said medical waste simply is `` a much more visible issue. When it closes your beach down, that makes a lot more rumblings.'' Many environmentalists see a silver lining in the dirty syringes, vials, bandages and other hospital debris that has washed ashore from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said public outrage over medical waste has been transferred to other less well known but potentially more dangerous coastal pollution problems. `` We're seeing it already, and I think that's being translated to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Catena </ORGANIZATION> said a bill banning sludge dumping off the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> shore was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last month because of the attention surrounding medical waste. `` It's helpful, no question about it,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, a leader in the medical waste fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It has probably been the best single item to draw attention to abuse of the oceans.'' Since incidents of medical waste pollution began making headlines around the Fourth of July weekend, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed a measure by Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> to require hospitals, transporters and disposal companies to adhere to a manifest system that would give investigators a paper trail to find the source of illegal dumping. The pilot program would cover <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> _ states where much of the dumping is suspected of taking place. A similar measure is pending in the House. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also approved amendments to a sludge dumping bill that would create criminal penalties of up to $ 250,000 in fines and five years in prison for illegal dumping. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee has approved a similar measure. Other bills still pending would set up a series of rules for the handling, treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of hospital waste. But <ORGANIZATION> Catena </ORGANIZATION> warned that proper funding levels must be made available to back up any new laws. `` It's great to have a law issued to address a problem, but if we do n't have the money to enforce it, it's not worth the paper it's printed on,'' he said.

 A congressional bid to grant tennis star <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> immediate American citizenship so he could play on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic team failed because Czechoslovakian officials refused to provide waivers for their native son, lawmakers said. <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>, the world's top-ranked tennis player, has lived in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, since 1981 and wanted to represent his adopted homeland in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this month. `` I am very excited about the possibilities of playing in the Olympics, Davis Cup and World Team Cup for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the tennis star said earlier this year. Enlisting the help of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> lawmakers, <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approval in April of a special immigration bill that would have waived the necessary five-year waiting period and given him immediate citizenship. That was a major victory because Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the immigration subcommittee, generally opposes Olympic-tied immigration bills Proponents considered the subcommittee vote <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON>'s biggest potential stumbling block. But on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, Rep. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., blocked the measure and said he would drop his opposition only if the proponents could secure a guarantee from the Czech government that it would provide a waiver for <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the Olympics Olympic rules required a waiver because <PERSON> Lendl </PERSON> previously represented <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in international competition at the Davis Cup.

<HEAD>Legislature Approves China's First State Secret Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature approved the nation's first law to protect state secrets, a strict regulation that stipulates life sentences and even the death penalty for violators, it was announced Monday. The law was adopted Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which handles the day-to-day affairs of the congress, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The panel then adjourned a weeklong meeting. The 35-article law protects national security and obliges all citizens and organizations to keep state secrets. The law will go into effect in May, replacing provisional regulations on state secrets that were issued in 1951. The Xinhua dispatch defined state secrets as `` important decisions of national defense, diplomatic affairs, secret affairs concerning the national economic and social development and science and technology and activities related to state safety and to the investigation of crime.'' The law divides state secrets into three categories: strictly confidential, confidential and secret. Disclosure of strictly confidential information would seriously damage state safety and interests, it said. Those who steal, secretly gather, buy or illegally provide state secrets to foreigners or foreign institutions will be sentenced to between five and 10 years in prison for minor cases. In extremely serious cases, the sentence is a minimum of 10 years, life imprisonment or the death penalty, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Marine Corps Using Living Fence To Boost Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAVELOCK, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Always looking for ways to improve security, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has planted a hedge that will sprout thousands of razor-sharp thorns said to be strong enough to stop a speeding jeep. About 60,000 bushes bearing the brand name Living Fence have been planted at the Marine air station at <LOCATION> Cherry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> to increase security around flight lines, storage areas for explosives and the military kennel. `` Once the hedgerow is fully grown, you'd have to use a chain saw or -LRB- explosives-packed -RRB- bangalore torpedo to get them out,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shivers </PERSON>, provost marshal of Cherry Point. The plant's scientific name is trifoliate orange. The bushes, which grow abundantly in the hills of east <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, sometimes extend to a height of 20 feet and are used by farmers to protect cattle and hogs. When shrubs mature about five years after planting, harmless-looking green hedgerows at <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point </ORGANIZATION> will conceal 3 - to 5-inch thorns that make the barrier nearly impossible to climb over or cut through `` To enhance our overall security program, we thought we'd give these bushes a try,'' Shrivers said. He said a common nickname for the bush is P.T. `` That stands for the pain and terror'' inflicted on anyone who tries to break through the hedge, he said. `` The Marines that work on it have some unquotable names for it,'' Shivers said. The bushes, which are marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Barrier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concepts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, cost about $ 1.50 apiece. The marketer boasts they are strong enough to stop a jeep. Cherry Point officials have invested $ 82,000 in the project. Most of the shrubs at Cherry Point were planted about a year ago. Barrier Concepts officials said the plants last up to 35 years, three times as long as metal barriers. Shrivers said the project is a local Marine initiative and has n't been `` condemned or blessed'' by his superiors. Barrier Concepts officials say the plant's seeds were first brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1860s by Chinese coolies working on western railroads. The Chinese did n't use the hedge for security reasons. They used the thorns for acupuncture.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> executive who won a $ 16.7 million settlement after charging he was wrongfully fired for refusing to offer bribes to foreign officials says he has not decided how to use his wealth. The majority of the settlement _ the $ 12.25 million former <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was awarded for being wrongfully discharged _ is tax-free. He and fellow former vice president <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> filed suit claiming they were illegally fired for refusing to offer bribes to foreign officials or to cover up such bribes. An eight-week jury trial of their case in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> ended June 10 with a $ 69.5 million decision against <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, and a finding that <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by engaging in a pattern of illegal interstate activity to obtain oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> later sought a new trial or a different judgment, and finally agreed to pay the two men $ 25 million. As part of the settlement, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and the court agreed to set aside the RICO finding. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said last week he was still trying to recover from the stress of intense negotiations that led up to the settlement. Among the settlement's numerous terms is one providing that <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> can not portray themselves in any future movie versions of the case. `` That -LRB- point -RRB- was n't hard to give up,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. After the trial, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had said that his expenses were enormous and that he had been unable to find employment equal to his six-figure position at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. He is paid $ 50,000 a year as a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Englehard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company which supplies catalysts to refineries, and he hopes to land other consulting contracts. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has moved to <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. In addition to his share of the $ 25 million, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and his attorneys received a taxable $ 2 million for breach of contract. They also won almost $ 2.5 million for various expenses; the agreement did not make clear whether that money was taxable. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 25 million settlement was paid Aug. 26. The settlement agreement also gave <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and his attorneys $ 1.65 million for expenses related to the case. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said last week that money did not cover legal fees but was for related costs such as depositions, copying documents and hotel bills. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tachau </PERSON> declined to discuss details not included in the written agreement, such as the attorneys' percentage of the settlement. <PERSON> Tachau </PERSON>'s law firm _ <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Todd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Heyburn </LOCATION> _ had as many as nine attorneys and several staff members working on <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s case, <PERSON> Tachau </PERSON> said. The firm also opened a temporary office in <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION> during the eight-week trial.

 <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown-Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's first regional commuter carrier and once the largest, officially dies Tuesday. In reality, it died four years ago. `` What's happening now is like watching a patient catching cancer,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had to resign as <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> stripped his pilot's license in disastrous 1984 `` When the patient dies, it's merciful. Some industry analysts say the demise of the 39-year-old airline is an example of how deregulation has crippled small commuter airlines, partly by spurring fare wars and unchecked growth. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> started the carrier on Nov. 30, 1949, with just a two-seat Cessna 140. Over the years, <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> routinely ran extra planes to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> and area resort islands if more passengers showed up, and it grew in the early 1980s after <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> turned control over to his expansion-minded sons. Then came back-to-back fatal accidents in 1984. The federal government shut down the airline because of safety and training violations. Two weeks after it was flying again, 13 people died in a crash in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Bankruptcy and takeover followed close behind. The bitter <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> sons say the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> overreacted to minor problems. The father says his sons too brashly expanded what was a cozy and profitable regional service. `` We did n't overreact at all,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. `` We reacted properly and in the interest of aviation safety.'' <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> formally ceases to be an airline Tuesday when its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, a tiny part of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, retires its federal operating certificate. <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>'s planes are being sold _ including N136PB, a DC-3 flying since the durable breed went out of production in the 1940s _ and service on some routes will be reduced or canceled, <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> sales director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` You might lay the whole thing at the door of deregulation,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurdle </PERSON>, associate editor of Travel Weekly, who has written about <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was worried about the competitive effects of deregulation, so he expanded arguably more than he should have.'' Over the years, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON> conservatively expanded service. In the late 1950s, he worked out a innovative deal with <ORGANIZATION> Naples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under which the two carriers borrowed each other's services in the off-season; <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> sent its planes and crews north in the summer, while <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>'s operations migrated south in winter. Then he retired in 1980, turning <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> over to his sons, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who bought more planes, acquired another small airline and bulked up operations. Flights were added around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the South. `` I had reservations,'' said the elder <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsdale </PERSON>, 68. `` I felt they were moving a little too fast. On the other hand, everything seemed to be going well.'' By 1983, <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> was the largest regional commuter in the nation. It carried 220,000 passengers in 1979 and saw its load grow six times to 1.3 million in the first nine months of 1984, a period in which <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> reported profits of $ 3.3 million on revenues of $ 58.4 million. By the end of 1984, <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> had 1,600 employees, 500 daily flights and 104 planes. `` In order to survive in a deregulated environment we had to grow,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 43. `` They were the envy of some carriers for some time because they made money,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based aviation consultant. Then came the crashes and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny. Public confidence collapsed. Passenger traffic dropped 50 percent in two days, bankers tightened the reins on more than $ 30 million in credit, the stock plummeted. <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy in March 1985. A year later it was bought for $ 30 million by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, itself now defunct. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economics professor who headed the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> when it deregulated the industry in 1978, disagrees that deregulation is to blame for <ORGANIZATION> PBA </ORGANIZATION>'s collapse `` Deregulation gave people an opportunity to make money, as some of them have,'' he said, `` and gave other people a chance to make mistakes.''

<HEAD>Group Seeks To Establish First Jewish TV Station </HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group wants to start what it believes would be the first television station in the country that offers a full slate of programming aimed at a Jewish audience. <ORGANIZATION> Bridgeways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westport </ORGANIZATION> said its programming would be cultural rather than religious. `` It will not be the Jewish version of the 700 Club,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bridgeways </PERSON>' president. The station's target audience would be the 3 million Jews living in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, metropolitan <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. `` The station is intended to be both a resource and a celebration of the contributions the Jewish community has made to society,'' <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> said. While the programs would be designed to appeal to Jews, `` we want to be attractive to a broader audience as well,'' <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> said. The station plans to offer programming in areas such as the arts, education, travel, politics, science, history, business and current events, <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> said. Bridgeways now operates <ORGANIZATION> WBCT-TV </ORGANIZATION>, Channel 43, a home shopping channel, which he said was started to preserve the company's <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> license before becoming a station offering Jewish programming. Investors have already raised and spent $ 3 million to finance construction of the station's transmitter and antenna, located in <LOCATION> Seymour </LOCATION>. An additional $ 500,000 was just raised to finance development of the new format. <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> placed the total costs of establishing the station at about $ 10 million. If Bridgeways is to be successful in its endeavor, industry experts say it will have to persuade cable companies in the region to carry the station and convince advertisers that Jews will watch its programs. <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON>, chairwoman of <LOCATION> Bridgeways </LOCATION>, are confident that cable networks will make room for Channel 43. `` People are very concerned about their roots. It's a trend in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in all ethnicities today,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON> said. Said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlock </PERSON>: `` We offer a large, focused, loyal and well-educated audience ... what more does an advertiser want.''

 Country singer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> says that when he was a teen-ager, singing in front of an audience did n't bother him, but that was all he could do on stage `` To sing was no problem, but talking scared me to death,'' said <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, a former short-order cook who got his start in clubs in his native <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` I did n't know what to say.

 Barefoot women, among the millions of homeless in flooded <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, clambered from boats Monday onto the only strip of this village still above water and surrounded army officers who doled out food. They pushed each other in the light rain to get at the giant cooking pots. They stuffed fistfuls of cooked rice and lentils into their own pots and bowls, or into the folds of their mud-stained saris. Floods have submerged three-fourths of the nation and claimed at least 406 lives this summer, according to official figures. Daily tallies in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the death toll at 1,015. More than 92,000 people are known to suffer from diarrhea and 5,715 more from dysentery, the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Taslimur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, joint secretary of the ministry, told reporters in the capital of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> that people get the diseases by drinking impure water, often the very flood water that maroons them. Officials say water purification tablets are being distributed but residents of <LOCATION> Bailtali </LOCATION>, a village of 2,000 people 55 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, said they had not seen any. `` The water that is available to drink is the flood water. We have no option but to drink it,'' <PERSON> Injul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Majumder </PERSON>, a 37-year-old teacher, told reporters who arrived by helicopter. He translated his reply from English to Bengali for villagers who crowded around. A dozen men nodded vigorously in agreement. Only two short strips of road, totaling about 500 yards, remained above water in <LOCATION> Bailtali </LOCATION>. One was covered with makeshift shelters of bamboo poles and palm thatch, and the other was bare as two air force helicopters descended through the rain, except for the food kettles. Round holes were punched into the mud along the road and bamboo poles lay nearby. An army officer, who would not give his name, said temporary shelters were dismantled so the helicopters could land. More than 100 small fishing boats, carrying two to 10 people each, bobbed beside the road in flood waters that had engulfed power lines and left only the tips of poles and a few loops of wire visible. People throughout <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> are huddled on tiny outcroppings of muddy earth like those at <LOCATION> Bailtali </LOCATION>. The largest bit of land seen during a helicopter tour Monday that covered one-tenth of the country was about the size of a football field. `` Almost all the districts are like this. Do n't think this is the worst,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told a dozen foreign journalists who accompanied him on the flight. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said 50 of the country's 64 districts and 25 million of its 110 million people have been `` directly affected'' by floods that began in June with the annual monsoon, then eased, but worsened again last week. By his definition, `` directly affected'' included anyone who had lost relatives, a home or business, crops or other property. `` It is a calamity,'' he said. `` It's like a war situation, and then you have to reconstruct the country.'' <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said it was too early to put a cost on the damage and reconstruction, but called the loss `` colossal _ homes, agriculture, communications, bridges, culverts, educational institutions, all damaged or washed away.'' He and the pilots said the helicopter tour covered 4,000 to 5,000 square miles northwest, west and southwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The choppers sometimes flew only 200 to 400 feet above the water. About 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Jamuna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, mighty rivers even in non-flooding months, muddy brown water stretched for up to 25 miles, interrupted only by protruding treetops. Entire villages had vanished. In some towns, people had pitched tents on the roofs of buildings tall enough to reach above water level, and taken their goats and chickens to safety with them. Floods are an annual monsoon event in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a disaster that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops, but <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> and other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory. Last year's floods killed about 300 people, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said, but <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1,500. Because the floods come regularly, people seek higher ground or take to boats as soon as the water starts rising, thus averting greater loss of life. The government says most who drown are small children and elderly people. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, whose per capita annual income of $ 150, is one of the world's poorest nations. Rivers run through it like veins, making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour south into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>. `` There should n't even be a country here. There should n't be any people here,'' a Western relief worker said. Asked whether canals and dams would help, he shook his head in despair and replied: `` There's too much water.''

 <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON>, a law school lecturer jailed without charge longer than any other white activist, was freed Monday after more than two years in detention but was placed under heavy restrictions. <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON>, 43, was detained June 12, 1986, the day that President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared a nationwide state of emergency that remains in effect. <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> spent much of his detention in solitary confinement and was allowed a half-hour visit from his brother or sister every two weeks. A restriction order issued by Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> places <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> under nighttime house arrest and bars him from any educational facility, effectively preventing him from returning to his job at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> was being released on `` humanitarian grounds'' because his health had deteriorated in recent weeks. The statement did not elaborate. <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON>, wearing blue jeans and a blue sweatshirt, had a tearful reunion with his sister and his friends at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> house where he will be required to spend each night. Atop his shoulder was a small lovebird he had been allowed to keep in his cell at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Prison. Friends said three months ago <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> was allowed to keep a bird, but the first died, and the second escaped, even though its wings had been clipped. His restriction order requires him to report twice daily to the neighborhood police station, forbids him from leaving <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and bars him from giving interviews, according to his lawyers. They said <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> also is barred from working with various anti-apartheid organizations and can not have more than four visitors at his house at one time. An estimated 30,000 people, virtually all of them black, have been detained for varying periods during the emergency. The government does not issue comprehensive statistics on detentions. Last week, it said there were 802 detainees still in custody who had been held longer than 30 days. <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON>, a law lecturer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, served eight years in prison starting in 1975 for aiding the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. In March 1985, he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a non-banned nationwide anti-apartheid coalition. In 1986, he co-authored a book about the Freedom Charter, a blueprint for a non-racial, post-apartheid <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Suttner </PERSON> was detained at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s airport as he was about to fly to <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, to deliver lectures about the Freedom Charter and popular justice.

A lawsuit filed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> general manager for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, also claims his supervisors forced him to engage in illegal financial practices designed to drain capital from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He alleges he was fired unfairly by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, when he refused. The lawsuit is set for trial Sept. 13 before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, who last month denied <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> attorney's request that the case be dismissed. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to discuss the matter but issued a brief statement denying <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>'s allegations. According to the statement, the 10-year GTE veteran was fired for failing to `` perform satisfactorily as a general manager.'' He was never encouraged to engage in illegal activities during his three-year term as general manager of the company's electric products subsidiaries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it said. `` Mr. <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>'s suit is totally without merit and we're confident that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> will be completely exonerated in this matter,'' the statement said <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>, 57, who now owns a small manufacturing business in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, denied he was fired for poor performance. Neither he nor his lawyers would discuss the case further. In court documents, his lawyers have indicated that they intend to bring up during the trial similar allegations made against <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> in the past. According to the documents, <PERSON> Odalier </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s vice minister and later minister of the economy from 1983 through 1986, was involved in the bribery scheme <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, through the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Consultoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inversiones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltda </ORGANIZATION>., paid <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> the equivalent of $ 400 to $ 500 a month beginning in 1983 so he would prevent a competitor from selling products in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON> said in a deposition <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> suggested the payments, and they were approved by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>'s superior in <LOCATION> Danvers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s precision materials and Sylvania lighting groups, the lawsuit said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who eventually fired <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON>, did not return a telephone call to his office in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where he is now vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s electrical components and materials division. <PERSON> Villalobos </PERSON> could not be reached in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for comment. <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON> claims his only interference with the payments was to set the monthly limit and to insist the consulting company find a way to make the payments appear legal in the company's books. He says he objected, however, when the company sought to exchange in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars instead of local currencies and encouraged illegal methods if legal ones were unavailable. To obtain this objective, <PERSON> DiMatteo </PERSON> says his superiors turned to the black market, smuggling and other illegal methods, according to a disposition. An audit of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> accounting firm in 1983 noted that the company had exchanged in the currency black market in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and warned the company against continuing the practice, according to court documents. In 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charged that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> paid as much as $ 14 million in bribes and kickbacks in 28 countries, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. GTE neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but consented to a permanent injunction, agreeing to refrain from any future violations.

<HEAD>Labor Chief Backs Sub-Minimum Wage For Teen-Agers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said Monday the big increase in the minimum wage sought by Democrats could cost jobs and fuel inflation. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, defended Republican support for a sub-minimum `` training'' wage for teen-agers. `` The minimum wage increase across the board as it's being discussed by the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is really a job loser and potentially inflationary,'' said <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. But in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a Labor Day rally, `` We're going to raise that minimum wage and make sure the people of this country have a decent income.'' The minimum wage has been set at $ 3.35 an hour since 1981. Democrats are pushing bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would raise it to $ 4.55 by 1991 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version or $ 5.05 by 1992 in the House version. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is generally opposed to raising the $ 3.35-an-hour minimum wage. His running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, has led the opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to a Democratic bill that would raise the minimum and peg it to inflation. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said last week that he now favors a gradual increase in the minimum wage to $ 4 an hour, coupled with a training wage. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said she was on the same wavelength as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We're sort of talking the same thing. There is an interest in increasing the minimum wage but there's a greater interest in having some kind of a training wage,'' she said. Merely increasing the minimum wage does not address young workers' need for better education and training, she said. `` I think the idea of some kind of a training wage that might allow us to get, particularly our young people, into a job, learn about coming to work, coming back the next day and learning a little bit about what it takes to hold a job might be helpful,'' she said. She questioned the logic of an across-the-board increase when `` there are some places right now that some are suffering from job shortages and you ca n't get a job for $ 7 or $ 8 an hour and there are other place in our country you'd love to have a job at $ 3.35.''

<TEXT>
 More than three years after <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 was hijacked to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, two of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passengers who were held hostage aboard the plane will tell a German court about their terrifying ordeal. Their testimony will be given at the trial of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who is accused of air piracy and murder. The trial resumes Tuesday after a four-week recess. Thirty-nine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passengers were held captive for 17 days, and a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed during the hijacking. Some passengers were beaten and many said they were tormented with death threats after the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> flight was commandeered on June 14, 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who already admitted in court that he was one of the four men who took part in the hijacking, is expected to testify Tuesday before the judges hear from the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, whose names have been withheld. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Monday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was flying the two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> witnesses to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> aboard military aircraft for security reasons. `` That's why from tomorrow on, security level No. 1 will be in force at the <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> Air base,'' the newspaper said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is having the witnesses brought to the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> trial with military aircraft.'' Asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> report, base spokesman Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` I have not heard anything.'' Security level No. 1 is the highest possible at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base. The pilot of flight 847, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, already has told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> that he probably will sleep at the <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> base just outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> when he comes to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> later this month to testify. `` They will first testify about the identification of the suspect,'' court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said of the two American witnesses. `` And they'll also testify about the horrible experiences during the hijacking.'' The hijackers beat 23-year-old <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, before he was fatally shot and his body was thrown onto the runway at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport. West German officials arrested <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on Jan. 13, 1987 at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, when customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage. His trial began July 5 in a specially built courtroom inside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison. He has testified that the goal of the hijacking was to force the release of Lebenase Shiite Moslems imprisoned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Shortly after the ordeal was over, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released about 700 Shiites. In a surprise move Aug. 9, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted he had taken part in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking but denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Under West German law, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court can convict <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> of murder even if he did not pull the trigger. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who West German officials say is 24 years old, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also have indicted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> on air piracy and murder charges, but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has refused an extradition request from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In April, a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court sentenced one of his brothers, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two German businessmen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an unsuccesful bid to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> from prison. The other three men involved in the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking remain at large.

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Titan 2 rocket that once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into space Monday, carrying a secret <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> payload believed to be four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships. The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a week. `` It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as expected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles. The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cloud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> Surveillance System, an electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space policy analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said before the launch. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> really likes them,'' said <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, of the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. `` They are very important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said a White Cloud launch `` consists of one mother satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in polar orbit. The $ 37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West and into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said at this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch. The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit. Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, where they served as intercontinental ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. But the missiles were removed from service `` because the propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had a tendency to blow up,'' <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space boosters under a $ 528.9 million contract with <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials have said more are likely to be refurbished because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new rockets Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting Soviet communications was launched by a $ 65 million Titan 34D rocket from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. But a source close to the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was little hope of salvaging that mission. Despite that failure, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch, declaring, `` This is the year of space launch recovery.'' `` Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new boosters the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will launch in the coming year,'' <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON> said. `` The Titan 2, <ORGANIZATION> Titan </ORGANIZATION> 4 and the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 ... will ensure this nation's access to space for many years to come.'' The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently was delayed by a fuel leak that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said spurred evacuation of the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident, officials said. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into orbit from <LOCATION> Vandenberg </LOCATION> was a Defense Meteorological Support Program satellite. But he called that unlikely. A Titan 2 exploded in its <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> silo on Sept. 19, 1980, killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been replaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials have testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a classified program. Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _ already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said. <PERSON> Pike </PERSON> compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar Ocean Reconaissance Satellites, which monitor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship movements.

<TEXT>
 American negotiators on Monday broke off talks with <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> officials about a new agreement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases after <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> announced it will close the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> installation at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the talks were `` temporarily suspended'' so the negotiating team, headed by Ambassador <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, can return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for guidance. The spokeswoman said the Greek side `` for the first time stated their call for the closure of <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION> base was non-negotiable.'' Neither she nor <PERSON> Sotiris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> government spokesman, could say when the talks, held at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, would resume. The suspension came at the beginning of a ninth round of negotiations for a new Greek-American defense accord to replace a 1983 agreement that expires in December. The talks began in November 1987. <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>, which is next to <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, is one of four American bases that have operated in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since the 1950s. It provides support for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planes monitoring Soviet naval operations in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and for the three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. The Greek government has not indicated that it intends to close any of the other bases. About 1,400 American servicemen, 200 civilian employees and 700 Greeks work at the base, located 10 miles from the city center. About 3,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel are stationed at the four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases, two near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and two on the island of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>. As a form of rent for the bases, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> currently receives $ 340 million a year in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credits to purchase military equipment. The socialist government of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was elected in 1981 on a platform that called for closing all the American bases and pulling <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> out of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Two years later, he signed a new bases pact, saying the closures were postponed for its five-year duration. The premier now says <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> is willing to sign another bases agreement, but that it must first be approved in a referendum. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> also insists that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> help solve Greek-Turkish disputes over military control of the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the divided island of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in return for a new agreement. Under the terms of the 1983 pact, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> issued a formal shut-down notice for the bases in July, although it is not expected to be carried out. Last month, the government said it was planning to shut down <LOCATION> Hellenikon </LOCATION>. But Monday's announcement at the talks was the first official notification to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government.

<HEAD>No Radiation Leak During Soviet Nuclear Plant Fire, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear power plant caught fire in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> on Monday, but automatic safety systems extinguished the flames before radiation could be released, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said no one was injured by the blaze which began at 12:50 a.m. in a control cable of the second reactor of the <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION> power plant in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, a Soviet republic on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The chief dispatcher of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozdyshev </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> the reactor's safety systems automatically kicked in and that the fire had already been put out by the time firefighters arrived. He said no radiation escaped the plant, and there were no injuries among the public or plant employees. The reactor, one of two at the plant, was shut down after the accident, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency's prompt reporting of the fire reflected the new official policy under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for more openness, especially about important events such as accidents. `` Considering the heightened public interest in nuclear reactor operations, which is quite understandable after the Chernobyl accident, we decided to inform the public about what has happened at the <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION> station at once,'' <PERSON> Pozdyshev </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> waited days before informing the world of the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. The first report on the accident came from Swedish officials after high levels of radiation were discovered in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The world's worst nuclear power accident killed 31 people and sent out a cloud of radiation that stretched worldwide. It led to a major re-evaluation of the safety of nuclear power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in many other countries. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported on Thursday that <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s Cabinet had ordered construction stopped on a third reactor at <LOCATION> Ignalina </LOCATION>. The newspaper said numerous safety violations were committed during construction of the plant's first reactor, and were repeated on the third unit. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a commission has been formed to investigate today's accident

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is planning dual fall campaigns: an overt political one on behalf of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other an effort to wring a wish list of items from an election-minded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm sure the president's philosophy right now is very much _ ` So little time and so much to do,''' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff.

Included on the more contentious side of the ledger are the renewal of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, welfare reform and passage of the remaining 11 appropriations bills. When he signed an appropriation bill in mid-August, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> not to repeat its past habit of sending him `` a single mega-bill ... that wraps up the various appropriations bills in a single bill that spends $ 600 billion of the taxpayers' money.'' And in his radio address on Saturday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave notice he'll veto any welfare legislation <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sends him if it does not contain a work requirement `` The best way to learn to work is to work,'' the president said in his Labor Day weekend radio address. On his way back from a vacation at his ranch in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned two stops Tuesday _ the dedication of the <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and an address to the American Legion in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.

Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> has told reporters <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is expected to travel twice a week on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, visiting between eight to 15 cities in the next two months. `` The main thing will be to draw the distinction between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political agenda. `` He'll talk about peace through strength, why a strong military forced the Soviets to the bargaining table and resulted in arms control agreements of unprecedented proportions _ and contrast that with the Democratic opposition's military stance of reduction in strength, pulling troops out of various places around the world. `` These will be his themes and we thing they'll play in all parts of the country,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> predicted. The president has no foreign trips planned, but is likely to go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for the opening of the fall <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session.

 An explosion during a fireworks display killed a civic-minded lawyer, tragically ending a Labor Day weekend celebration in his hometown, officials said Monday. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broster </PERSON>, 28, who returned to practice law in the southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town of 2,300 people about a year ago, was helping set off the fireworks when the accident happened Sunday night, said Mayor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON>. `` I do n't know of anybody that did n't like <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. `` He was a fine young attorney. He was a very fine young man. He had excellent character and everything. It's just a tragedy.'' <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Broster </PERSON> had recently worked as a part-time city attorney, handling all legal work for the town since it does n't have a full-time city attorney <LOCATION> Grayville </LOCATION> police and the state fire marshal's office were investigating the cause of the explosion, said a police dispatcher. She said the accident happened at 8:19 p.m. Sunday while <PERSON> Broster </PERSON> was `` assisting with the annual fireworks display'' in a city park. He was flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Welborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, where he was dead on arrival at 9:45 p.m., said a nursing supervisor. Several thousand people had gathered Sunday night to watch the fireworks display, which was the finale to the annual Grayville Days Celebration. The events, which started Friday, included a parade, the `` Miss Grayville'' and `` Little Miss Grayville'' beauty contests, and carnival attractions. `` Everything was just going swell,'' he said. `` This kind of put a black cloud over it.'' The display had been going on five or 10 minutes when the explosion occurred, the mayor said. The fireworks were being set off from mortars, each manned by someone loading, someone firing and someone cleaning, he said. `` I think his job was the cleaning,'' <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bernita </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Sturm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>, which was making arrangements for the lawyer's funeral, said the victim's parents, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Broster </PERSON>, were among the crowd watching the fireworks She said <PERSON> Broster </PERSON> was single and was active in the Lion's Club and Jaycees. `` He was just a nice guy, that's all,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` It's devastating, really. In a small town where you know everybody, it's very bad.''

 Students threatened on Monday to launch further strikes and mass protests unless an interim government is formed to supervise multiparty elections that would end 26 years of one-party rule. In another development, at least 20 people were killed in a <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb in a clash between neighborhood security patrols and thieves. The <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> told reporters the government must meet their demands by 8 p.m. Wednesday or protests will follow Thursday. Opponents of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have rejected President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s proposed nationwide referendum on the future of his party. For the past weeks, the government has been crippled by strikes and daily demonstrations, and a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat estimated that 40 town administrations were taken over by protesters. Neighborhood committees, formed largely of students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, have patrolled many areas of the country against the spreading lawlessness and violence. On Sunday, residents of the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Okkalapa </ORGANIZATION> said a bloody clash occurred after thieves captured 15 members of a neighborhood committee who rushed to a government biscuit factory to stop looting. On Monday, a mob burst into the factory, where they found eight members of the committee dead, including two monks. The mob then killed 12 thieves, captured 10 and set fire to nearby houses belonging to people suspected of involvement in the looting, the residents said. The thieves reportedly included people recently released from jail. More than 10,000 prisoners have been released or escaped from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> jails over the past two weeks in what some diplomats speculate was a calculated move by the government to create chaos to justify a military crackdown. The <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Monday released what it said was a secret Aug. 22 directive from the head of government military intelligence. `` Under prevailing conditions in the country, intelligence units and their informers must use various methods to cause fear and confusion among the public,'' the directive said. It bore a signature and official stamp, but its authenticity could not be verified. A Japanese <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> scholar, <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiryu </PERSON>, said on Monday the situation in the country was `` chaotic'' and it was uncertain if <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s government would survive until the party meeting. Also Monday, more than 50,000 people held a solemn ceremony on a lake in suburban <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> for student protesters said to have been killed, assaulted and drowned there by police during March 17 anti-government demonstrations. Wreaths were placed on a flower-decked raft which drifted away as many students wept and prayed aloud. The government said at least 43 people died in the March riots, but Western diplomats said at least 100 people were killed. Demonstrations flared in June and again after ruler <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned July 23 after 26 years in power. The party chose hard-liner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. Government radio said 112 people died in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in rioting against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who resigned after only 17 days in power.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity activists said on Monday that more strikes will occur in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> if negotiations with the government on workers' grievances do not achieve a positive result. At a news conference for Western correspondents at the apartment of senior Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, representatives of miners and steel workers on strike last week said that they were pinning their hopes on winning legalization of the banned Solidarity union on the upcoming talks. `` It is certain'' more strikes will occur if the talks fail, said <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. `` Workers problems will not be settled without Solidarity,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> who was with striking miners in recent weeks in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said there has been no word yet from the authorities about when the talks would be convened and exactly who would participate. He said Solidarity was prepared to propose its delegation to the talks, but gave no details. There were indications that the talks first proposed by Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> kiszczak might not take place until next week. `` There is no rush really. Preparation is a must,'' journalist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, an adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview over the weekend. <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON> said the workers who went on strike between Aug. 16 and Saturday were fighting for an independent trade union, and were not interested in transforming Solidarity into a political club, as has been mentioned by some commentators in the official media. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since the 1981 martial law crackdown on Solidarity ended Saturday, when remaining strikers left an occupied mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the port and main bus depot in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had pressed the strikers to quickly settle local grievances and end the strikes so talks about the future of Solidarity could begin within the framework of the round table talks offered by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. Meanwhile, Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazierski </PERSON> said 200 transit workers demanding higher pay went on strike Monday in the small city of <LOCATION> Zdunska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, 120 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>.

 Opening statements are set Tuesday for the court-martial of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue-swimmer instructor charged in the drowning of a trainee. A five-officer panel will hear the case of Petty Officer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. He is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the March 2 death of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. His trial has been delayed a full week by extended pretrial motions in his case and the court-martial of his former boss, Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. A four-member court-martial last week found <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, former officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, innocent of dereliction of duty in <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s Much of the prosecution testimony in <LOCATION> Combe </LOCATION>'s trial is expected to mirror that in <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s case. In the earlier court-martial, a pathologist testified that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, who had a phobia about being dragged under water, drowned in a swimming pool at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> after suffering a fear-induced heart attack. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is accused of holding his head under after instructors threw the panic-striken victim back into the pool when he climbed out and tried to exercise his right to drop out of the voluntary training, witnesses testified. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, who was on the telephone in his office overlooking the pool, blamed the instructors for exceeding their authority and using bad judgment. He testified that if he had been present <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> would still be alive, but he saw and heard nothing to alert him the recruit was in danger. The prosecution and defense each plan to call as many as 30 witnesses in <LOCATION> Combe </LOCATION>'s case, expected to take at least through the end of the week. Listed as defense witnesses are four instructors already punished for forcing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool. None of them had testified in <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s trial. Neither <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> nor his former boss, now-retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. C.L. <PERSON> Lavinder </PERSON>, who received a reprimand for dereliction of duty, are listed as potential witnesses by the defense or the prosecution.

<HEAD>Worst Of Drought Is Over For Mississippi River, But Problems

<TEXT>
 Shipping companies, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> are joining in an unprecedented effort to ensure that the drought-caused bottlenecks that idled <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> traffic this summer wo n't recur, a shipping industry executive says. The three groups are forming a task force and establishing a clearinghouse at <LOCATION> Cincinnait </LOCATION> to share information about the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rivers </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of a shipping industry group called American Waterway Operators. The drought, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, has cost the industry an estimated $ 200 million, about 20 percent of its annual operating revenue. However, the worst of the 1988 drought may be past for those who work on or live along the river, some officials believe. An underwater dike built by the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, for example, has stopped saltwater from creeping up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and fouling the water supply for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. However, the Corps has had to supply by barge some downriver communities with millions of gallons of fresh water. At <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the river is running at a rate of about 130,000 cubic feet per second _ about 55 percent of normal for this time of year. In early July, however, it was closer to 114,000. `` We're still way below average,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Steakely </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. `` But we're not nearly as bad as we were.'' Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> waters have pushed their way up the drought-reduced river, turning the muddy, brown water a beautiful blue-green and threatening the water supply for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, which is about 100 miles from the mouth of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Because the salty water is heavier than the fresh <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> water, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> decided to impede the flow by building a dirt dam 15 to 25 feet high across the river bottom. The $ 790,000 structure, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, succeeded in heading off the salty flow. It was too late, however, for some small communities in <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> continues to deliver barge-loads of water from farther upriver. By the middle of last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had barged 52 million gallons for those communities, according to <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> office of the Corps. The increased flow on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> also means a reduction in the number of bottlenecks that idled traffic upriver in June. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> relaxed restrictions on towboat loads that had been imposed earlier this summer because of low water levels on the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The task of the clearinghouse on river conditions is to ensure that everyone on the river is informed of current developments, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` It's a matter of the industry and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the Corps working smarter,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` They took all the communications that were disparate and decentralized, and centralized them out of one office on the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' As for how long the drought will affect the rivers, the experts are n't sure. `` Based on what the weather service has said, there's virtually no way we're going to get back to normal ... We've been hearing we're in for drought conditions on the river through the remainder of the summer,'' said <PERSON> Sossaman </PERSON>. The amount of rain needed to bring the river back up to its average flow rate may not come around until next spring, <PERSON> Steakely </PERSON> said. And that's all right with him. A sudden heavy flow of water down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> would dump more sand and sediment down river and could cause as many problems with navigation as it would solve, <PERSON> Steakely </PERSON> said. Slow, steady improvement is better, he said. `` We really are n't hoping for a dramatic change quickly.

According to the Kurdish guerrillas, most of the civilians were killed in 65 villages they say have been attacked with chemicals. `` Most of the Kurdish civilian casualties are from constant Iraqi poison gas attacks on their villages and settlements,'' a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official Iraqi news agency said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` strongly denied fabricated allegations reported by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on the use of chemical weapons in north <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' It quoted a commentator, not identified, as saying: `` These figures are only present in the figments of imagination of those who wove them'' and declared: `` All that happened in the north of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was that a group of traitors of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s agents collapsed and those of them who fled abroad could not find but lies to cover up their defeat.''

 Twelve of 14 renegade buffalo were rounded up on a south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> range _ bordering <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 75 </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Turnpike _ by latter-day trailhands on all-terrain motorcycles The two bison still at large, a female calf and a bull, are the last of 250 that escaped in March from a livestock ranch near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> when horse rustlers cut through a fence, said Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Oper </PERSON>, their owner. The roundup did n't come off without incident. A 30-year-old television reporter, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Fraga </PERSON>, tumbled seven feet onto his head from a swamp buggy, and was reported in serious condition Monday with a broken sternum and two cracked vertebrae. The roundup of the buffalo, also known as bison, began at dawn Sunday in 240 acres of marsh and pasture land near the border of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties. Oper, 64, risked jail for himself and confiscation of his animals if he did not round up the renegades this weekend, according to officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He had made several efforts to capture the animals.

About 35 volunteers on seven all-terrain motorcycles and four swamp buggies drove the buffalo herd west through scrub myrtle and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> holly and into a camouflaged pen where they were coaxed back into a cattle trailer for a trip back to the livestock ranch.

<HEAD>Soviet Marshal Says US Seeks Military Superiority at Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet military chief of staff said Monday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has begun an arms race at sea that increases the risk of war, and refuses to negotiate a reduction in naval forces. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces are a key instrument of pressure, helping to conduct -LRB- the -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions of strength policy,'' Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> wrote in a lengthy article in the Communist Party daily Pravda. The article, which included Soviet statistics comparing the superpower naval forces, appeared at a time when Western observers say they have detected a scaling back of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy activities. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, who toured <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval facilities during a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this summer, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some of its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies of starting `` an arms race at sea.'' `` They have enormous power,'' he wrote. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> comprises 15 attack aircraft carriers, of which five are nuclear-powered.'' The main thrust of <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>'s article was that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval forces are designed for offensive strikes while Soviet warships are intended to defend their country's coastline and can not be considered a military threat. As examples of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to deal powerful offensive blows, <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. `` In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> area, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies have amassed an armada of over 60 combatant ships, of which over half are American,'' the Soviet chief of staff wrote. `` This dangerous demonstration of naval might is explained ostensibly by the eagerness to ensure the freedom of shipping in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The true objective is to shore up the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval fleet on a permanent basis there.'' He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of opposing negotiations on reduction of naval forces or any agreement curbing their activity. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries `` do everything depending on them to turn the world ocean from a zone of war danger into a zone of peace and cooperation. We call upon the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to support us in this undertaking.''

 Utility crews worked Monday to complete repairs to the last of six electricity cables damaged in a fire that blacked out 50 blocks of downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for nearly four days. Workers had restored power by Sunday evening to the entire area with the exception of one building _ a parking garage with some office space _ near the underground vault where the fire began. In addition, said <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON>, electricity had not been turned back on in a few buildings whose owners were n't available or chose to wait, <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON> said. The sixth and final 13,000-volt cable gives the system redundant capacity, in case of extra-heavy demand or the need to turn off power in one of the other cables to make repairs, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. About half the affected customers had begun getting power when the switch was thrown on four feeder cables Saturday evening, and other customers were hooked up overnight before the fifth cable was repaired Sunday evening. As power was restored, fire crews roamed the area to ensure that no fires broke out in equipment on which power switches were on when the outage began. City Light officials had no estimate of costs to restore power or repair damage, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. The cause of the fire that sparked <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s biggest-ever power outage Wednesday remained unknown, but officials said an aluminum, direct-current supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus lines was a key factor in the blackout's severity. City Light assistant superintendent <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said Monday that the fire `` undoubtedly'' started in low-voltage City Light cables, which run from transformers to feed individual buildings. As the system heated, power to the high-voltage feeder cables should have been cut by `` current limiters.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit cable melted, and molten aluminum cut the high-voltage cables before power could be cut to all but two of them. `` Once the DC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> cable -RRB- started to go ... it took what would have been a minor inconvenience and turned it into a major event,'' <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said. `` It's like we had eight or nine welding torches going at the same time.'' What caused the low-voltage cables to catch fire in the first place wo n't be known until data is analyzed, <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said, adding he could not predict how long that would take. In the meantime, City Light crews will check other locations with similar dual arrangements of City Light and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> cables to try to head off other problems, <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure we're going to be looking at ways of protecting us from them and them from us,'' he said. Some customers in the blacked-out area already have filed monetary claims against the city, claiming losses as the result of the failure, <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON> said. During the height of the blackout, city officials estimated that 90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which included an estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place Market, the <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION> department store, the 875-room Westin Hotel, and uncounted other hotels, grocery stores and taverns.

 U.S.-mediated peace talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will reconvene Wednesday in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, the Department of Foreign Affairs announced.

Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has increased its troop strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> from 50,000 military personnel to 60,000. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and white-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed a cease-fire pact on Aug. 8 that links withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also called <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said on Aug. 30 that it had withdrawn the last of its forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, leaving rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to fight alone against the Cubans and government troops. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was not included in the peace talks and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has said his guerrillas will continue to fight for a power-sharing coalition with the Marxists. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> won independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 and <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> lost a civil war to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> - and Cuban-backed Popular Movement for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> then began a guerrilla campaign and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent troops to help the government. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, lying between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, has been administered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since World War I under a mandate by the defunct League of Nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has rejected demands by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> be given its independence. A major South African condition has been withdrawal of Cuban forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by Nov. 1 and allow elections by next June if the Cubans leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, that the rebels had rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to persuade them to accept a period of three years for the removal of the Cuban troops. It said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, tried to persuade the rebels at a meeting Aug. 27 at an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to accept a phased Cuban pullout over a three-year period. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Saturday at the rebels' headquarters at <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that he supported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to resolve the 13-year-old conflict but complained that <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> was `` giving all the cards'' to the Angolan government. `` The Cubans do not want to leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> knows that,'' said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, `` We will continue to fight until the country is truly free.'' `` There are now 60,000 Cubans in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and they are prepared to launch attacks within days.

<HEAD>Israelis Break Up Draft-Dodger Ring; 16 Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities on Monday arrested two lieutenant colonels and 14 other soldiers and civilians in raids on a group that took bribes to help Israelis avoid military service, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. An army statement said authorities began an investigation after receiving a tip that young people were avoiding active-duty and reserve service `` in exchange for gratuities and monetary gifts.'' Such an investigation is rare in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has a tradition of a `` citizen army.'' All Israeli Jews are required to serve in the military _ men for three years and women for two _ and men remain in the reserves until age 57. The army statement gave no indication of how widespread the scheme was, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television quoted military sources as saying it may have helped as many as several hundred Israelis avoid regular and reserve military service. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television called the scandal unprecedented and said more arrests were expected. The radio report said among the eight soldiers arrested were a woman and two lieutenant colonels and all were connected to the recruiting office. It did not identify them. The radio and television accounts said the civilians included several doctors and that `` large sums'' of money were involved, but did not elaborate. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Elimelech </PERSON>, head of military police, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television the scheme involved `` false medical documents and tampering with computers, entering and removing data.'' Disclosure of the draft-dodging came during the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Palestinians have been battling <LOCATION> Iraeli </LOCATION> rule in the territories since Dec. 8. The government has responded by sending thousands of troops into the areas and at least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in the uprising. Refusal to serve in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military is rare but some soldiers have rejected particular postings. At least 37 soldiers are in jail for refusing to serve in the occupied territories, according to <PERSON> Yesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gvul </PERSON>, an organization of conscientious objectors. <PERSON> Elimelech </PERSON> said it was `` absolutely impossible'' to link the draft-dodging scheme to the uprising. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the the suspects are to appear for arraignment Tuesday before a civil judge in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>, east of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A guerrilla rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport last week may have claimed far more casualties than reported by official Soviet and Afghan news media, Western diplomats said Monday. The sources, quoting dispatches from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on condition of anonymity, said two aircraft were confirmed destroyed in the attack Thursday and 12 helicopters were unaccounted for. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> put casualties at nine dead and 21 wounded, but the sources said that appeared low. `` Western diplomatic observers believe that casualties and damage to the military areas north of the airport are much higher than are currently being claimed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>,'' one said, but none of the sources said they had reliable figures. Last Thursday the same sources said rebel-fired rockets slammed into the airport and parts of the capital for more than an hour, causing `` massive damage'' and igniting an ammunition dump. Western diplomats reported seeing one An-12 transport plane on fire, an unidentified aircraft destroyed and two hangars burned to the ground. They said a helicopter park near the ammunition depot was largely empty and only 11 military helicopters were observed, `` leaving at least a dozen helicopters unaccounted for.'' Whether the helicopters had been destroyed or evacuated was not clear. Guerrillas also rocketed the airport Aug. 27, reportedly destroying one military transport, damaging runways and killing four people. Insurgents have made daring attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in recent weeks as Soviet troops withdrew, reaching the numerical halfway point on Aug. 15. On Sunday, the guerrillas claimed Soviet forces backed by Afghan troops had redeployed in the besieged southeastern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>. Soviet officials said the last <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops left the city Aug. 7 and Western sources said they could not confirm reports that any had returned. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> agency said eight Afghan warplanes bombed a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> village early Monday, killing one person and wounding eight. It identified the bombed village as <LOCATION> Bogay </LOCATION> in the Dir administrative district, 140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> near the Afghan border. Afghan warplanes earlier were reported to have bombed <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> territory last Thursday, killing one villager and wounding seven at <LOCATION> Shabqadar </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> governments have had strained relations since Soviet troops arrived in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 support the pro-Moscow government. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> accuse <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of aiding the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Soviets Blame Aborted Takeoff on Fuel Flooding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief designer of a Soviet cargo plane said Monday that engine flooding caused the aborted takeoff of the huge aircraft at the <ORGANIZATION> Farnborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s leading aviation event. <PERSON> Konstantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechakov </PERSON> told a news conference at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> a new engine for the Antonov 124, the world's heaviest plane, would be sent from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but was delayed awaiting overflight permission from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The blue-and-white aircraft remained grounded at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION>, 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Its takeoff was aborted Sunday, the opening day of the show. It was supposed to give display flights daily during the week-long show, at which the Soviets also are showing their most advanced fighters, two MiG-29s. At the embassy news conference members of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation praised the MiGs and were complimentary about rival Western combat aircraft on display, but dodged questions about Soviet production figures and sales targets. The delegation includes aviation officials, aircraft designers and a test pilot. `` There was an engine surge. The reason for this engine surge was the air bleed system,'' <PERSON> Lechakov </PERSON> said through an embassy interpreter. Aides who were questioned later said that meant engine flooding, or excessive fuel. A tongue of flames 20 feet long shot from one jet engine as the aircraft moved down the runway and the pilot shut down the three other engines of the 400-ton plane. <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> organizers have stressed safety after the Aug. 28 air show disaster at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where 52 people were killed and more than 300 injured when three Italian stunt flying aircraft collided and one crashed into the crowd. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksimovsky </PERSON>, deputy aviation minister, was asked why <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had decided to show the MiG-29 in the West and he said it was evidence of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or more openness. `` The participation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this year at <LOCATION> Farnborough </LOCATION> is proof of it,'' he declared. Test pilot <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Menitsky </PERSON>, who flew a MiG-29 in precision manuevers Sunday, praised the Western fighters on display, including the American F-18 and F-16 and the Mirage 2000 from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` But to be perfectly frank, I like our plane much better,'' he said.

<HEAD>Actor Who Played ``Goldfinger'' Dead At 75</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 German actor <PERSON> Gert </PERSON> <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON>, a gifted comic who became famous as the gold-craving criminal in the 1964 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> film `` Goldfinger,'' died of a heart attack Monday. He was 75. <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> was born <PERSON> Karl-Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> on Feb. 25, 1913, in <LOCATION> Planitz </LOCATION> in what is now <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He was a natural-born comic, described by critics as <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s version of American <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>. <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> played in nearly 100 films, including roles in the 1961 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production `` The Longest Day,'' and the British-produced `` The Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines,'' filmed in 1964. But he was best known internationally for his role as the greedy villain `` Goldfinger'' who battled <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>'s <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> in the film version of the <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> thriller. In 1965, <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> made headlines when he was quoted by the British newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>, as saying: `` Naturally I was a Nazi'' during the Third Reich. <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> denied making the comment and insisted: `` What I told an English reporter during an interview ... was that during the Third Reich I had the luck to be able to help two Jewish people, although I was a member of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party.'' Despite <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON>'s denial, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> banned all of his films for months until a Jewish man, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenau </PERSON>, informed the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> hid <PERSON> Blumenau </PERSON> and his mother from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. In a statement issued Monday, <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON>'s agent Pal <PERSON> Berkovicsa </PERSON> said the stocky actor died of a heart attack at 1 a.m. in a <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> hospital, where he underwent an operation after suffering a heart attack a week ago. Froebe studied theater under <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> actor <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during the early years of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. After theaters were closed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in September 1944, <PERSON> Froebe </PERSON> was called into the German army, where he served until the end of World War II. In his first major role in a film, `` <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Ballads,'' which opened in European cinemas in 1948, film critics wrote: `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has a new <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>.'' Froebe is survived by his fifth wife, <PERSON> Karin </PERSON>. He has two sons by previous marriages, <PERSON> Utz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON>.

 The widow and brother of Palau President <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> handled a revolver within minutes after <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was found shot to death and before the weapon was turned over to national police, a government spokesman said. The .357 - caliber Magnum revolver from which one shot had been fired was given to police at a hospital by <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> `` There was hysteria and panic,'' <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said. `` They were in shock. They were not involved in the shooting.'' The 51-year-old president was the second elected <ORGANIZATION> Palau </ORGANIZATION> chief executive to die by violent means in three years. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was elected in August 1985 to succeed <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>, who was assassinated two months earlier. Three Palau men convicted at trial in connection with <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>'s death later were acquitted. The Palau government has yet to make public results of an autopsy performed on Salii 55 hours after his Aug. 20 death at his home in <LOCATION> Koror </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island chain's capital. <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> is a 400-mile-long archipelago about 600 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and 4,500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Its nearly 15,000 residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship administered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free association that would terminate the trusteeship and make <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> self-governing. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is awaiting results of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> ballistics test on the revolver and the spent cartridge, <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The tests at the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might show if <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s fingerprints were on the weapon, <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON> said. `` We want to know for sure, we want to eliminate any doubt as to whether there were any other person's fingerprints on the gun,'' he said. `` We want to be absolutely certain that the bullet came from that gun.'' Meanwhile, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a copy of an Aug. 24 letter from a high-ranking traditional chief, <PERSON> Ibedul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, in which he addresses the question of whether <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> killed himself. In the letter to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, whose agency is responsible for <LOCATION> Palauan </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> wrote that new President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> told him the night of <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s death that it was a suicide. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> `` himself did it at his house.'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said, `` Since the forensic evidence was not finalized by then, it seems inconceivable that he -LRB- Remengesau -RRB- would then voice such an irresponsible conclusion.'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> for an investigation into the deaths of <LOCATION> Salii </LOCATION> and Remeliik. <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> was sworn in as president to fill out <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s remaining term which ends this year He was elected vice president at the special election in which <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was elected president. <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> also was minister of justice under the two slain presidents. Remengesau is expected to seek the presidency in <LOCATION> Palau </LOCATION>'s Nov. 2 general election.

 <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, vowing to tug at the hearts of viewers, used a parade of celebrities and emotional appeals from victims Monday to raise a record $ 41,132,113 in his 23rd annual Labor Day telethon to fight muscular dystrophy. The 21 -LCB- - hour event also featured appearances by corporate sponsors who contributed $ 34,379,537 not included in the telethon's final This year's figure exceeded by about $ 2.1 million the previous record of $ 39,021,723 set last year. `` The success of the show is a tribute to the warmth and generosity of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, who go further each year in supporting <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION>'s fight against muscle diseases,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said following the show. Because of the longevity and the money raised up to this year _ $ 443,182,370 _ the annual Labor Day event has become known as `` the'' telethon. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, in opening the annual event Sunday evening, promised `` there is light at the end of the tunnel'' in the long battle against 40 neuromuscular diseases targeted by the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He estimated that 120 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would view the opening and closing hours of the telethon. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who has long referred to young muscular dystrophy victims as `` my kids,'' told viewers the telethon was `` for your kids, who I never want to be my kids.'' The telethon featured news on progress the past year in the battle against the crippling diseases that touch 1 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families. <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said the organization was making strides in unlocking the mystery of the various muscle diseases. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> suffers from myasthenia gravis, a sometimes fatal muscle disease that is among the 40 covered by the <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION>. He said he had `` a stake in the outcome'' of the <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION> battle. <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> called telethon viewers `` part of the answer'' and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added `` without you, it wo n't happen.'' The show featured a segment on singer-comedian <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, who died in June of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as ALS or <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease. ALS is one of the neuromuscular diseases targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION>. Two of Day's 10 children were featured with their father as he talked of his hope of beating the disease. `` I could see it in his eyes,'' said son <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>. `` He was afraid. I was afraid too, afraid of losing him.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, an actor in the soap opera `` Another World,'' talked of his mother's slow death from ALS. `` It must have been terrifying for her to feel that trapped,'' <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said of the disease that cripples the body but not the mind. The telethon also featured some of the victims of muscular dystrophy who are waiting for a cure. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duyser </PERSON> of Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, wept as she talked about her husband, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a pharmacist crippled by muscular dystrophy. `` We have an 18-month-old baby and I'd like to have her dad see her grow up,'' she said. `` I'm afraid he wo n't be there.'' `` Our family needs a miracle, and I know you can do it,'' she told <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and the telethon audience. The Labor Day event, which <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> started on a single <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> station in 1966, is now carried by more than 200 stations. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, the telethon's long-time anchorman, was back, along with co-hosts <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasem </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRosa </PERSON>.

 Workers plugged the last of the 36 wells on the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil platform and divers now can search for bodies still missing in the world's worst oil rig disaster, the operating company said Monday. Crews operating from the support vessel Tharos installed the final cement plug Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` The plugging of the last well on <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> represents the successful conclusion of a key stage in the operation to secure the platform before divers can search the seabed,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brading </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said in the statement. <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> did not indicate when divers would try to recover the bodies of workers killed when the platform, about 120 miles off the Scottish coast, exploded in flames July 6. The disaster claimed 167 lives. A police spokesman said Monday 120 bodies remained missing and most were believed to be in the platform's living quarters, now submerged. About 500 feet of the rig's pre-explosion height of 649 feet is now under water.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made an 11th-hour plea to supporters Monday for help in raising a $ 3 million down payment in his bid to return to the ministry he left amid a sex-and-money scandal. `` I'm not going to leave any stone unturned,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not going to stumble now.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said friends and acquaintances have so far contributed close to $ 2 million in cash and letters of credit toward the $ 3 million he needs by Tuesday. He said a group of people is working on raising the remaining $ 1 million in thousand-dollar pledges and he has set up a trust account at a <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, bank to accept donations. Those donations would be used only if he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, succeed in purchasing the ministry, he said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he has raised the money and pledges by word-of-mouth. `` We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without a television station,'' he said. PTL Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> asked for the money as a sign of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s ability to follow through on the $ 165 million offer he's made for the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park, a satellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> so far leads the bidding for buying assets of the ministry that went into bankruptcy soon after he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987. But <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said Friday he was `` very, very skeptical'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could come up with the $ 3 million letter of credit by Tuesday. Calls to <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, home Monday went unanswered. After Tuesday, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he would consider other offers to purchase the ministry's assets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankrupty Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has instructed <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to recommend a buyer by Saturday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> expects to have the whole $ 3 million by Tuesday. But he said he plans to ask <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to accept $ 1 million in cash and a $ 500,000 letter of credit, so that the remaining funds could be used to pay immediate operating expenses. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> bank has agreed to handle the funds from unidentified Greek investors he says are backing his offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. He also said he has several other banks are willing to aid his bid, but he would not identify the banks. `` We're almost there,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said.

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> blasted Republicans <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> Monday as an uncaring duo willing to maintain a legacy of poverty for many Americans. `` In the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a fiercely Democratic Labor Day rally at a rodeo arena in this East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil city. `` And the vast majority of our people work harder and longer just to stay even. They need two incomes just to keep from slipping back,'' the senator argued. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> began his fall campaign in his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, saying he wanted to be more aggressive. He hopes to help the Democratic ticket bring home the Lone Star state's 29 electoral votes, now within the reach of either party. A poll published Monday in the Dallas Morning News showed the Republican ticket leading 47 percent to 44 percent, within a 3 percentage point margin of error. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him that he expected to take <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and win the national election, but he acknowledged that the Democrats were revising their tactics. `` I think you'll see a more aggressive campaign,'' he said. `` You ca n't keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw,'' such as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was unpatriotic because he vetoed a bill mandating the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the public schools of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he said. On that issue, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> added, Republicans would suffer a voter backlash. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, returning to the trail after a brief vacation in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, said he had spoken by telephone with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's new vice chairman who was returning a year after resigning for what some considered an unfair attack on Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rival at the time <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> began his Labor Day at a small business center in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, a central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> area struggling economically. He met with local people trying to launch new businesses and, afterward, told about 250 supporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who also claims <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his home, had done little for the state. `` They've sort of turned their backs on us, this administration has,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, standing in shirtsleeves outside the former high school building. The Republicans `` have an oil man who's running for president,'' he said, `` but, frankly, I ca n't remember anything he's done for the energy industry in the past eight years.'' At the <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> rally, attended by some 2,000 people, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` on the wrong side of every energy issue important to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ and still <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose him'' as his running mate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> exemplified the Republican attitude with his record opposing health care for pregnant women, immunizations for children and the bill requiring 60 days advance notice for workers facing plant layoffs. `` When it comes to basic issues important to working men and women, the Republicans say, ` No,''' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Republicans were trying to make ideology and patriotism the issues of the campaign, but, selling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to Texans, he said the real issues were jobs and opportunity. `` The Republicans like to wrap themselves in the flag, and demagogue on phony issues,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, standing before a huge American flag flanked by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flags. `` The Republicans like to talk about left and right. But this election is not about moving left or right,'' he said. `` It is about standing still with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or moving forward with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that the Republicans would create 30 million new jobs, noting there are only about 6 million people officially categorized as unemployed. `` I understand <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is out at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> today. I think he's out there talking to his economist,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who hosted the <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> rally, said he understood <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. The Republicans, he said, want people to have `` such sorry jobs, we're going to have to work two of'em.'' From <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where he introduced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a Labor Day picnic. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s two-day trip was to continue the job-creation theme on Tuesday with visits to a training center in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, outside of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the night.

There were these other developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can continue blocking international telephone lines to the occupied territories _ Journalists at state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> announced they would refuse assignments in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> after management rejected a request for reinforced cars and extra pay to work there Since the start of the uprising last Dec. 8 by Palestinians in the occupied lands, cars carrying press signs frequently have been stoned. The attacks followed rumors that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security agents used press credentials as a cover. _ The army issued orders prohibiting troops from firing tear gas into enclosed spaces The new policy resulted from a report last May by five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> physicians who determined that using tear gas in enclosed spaces was dangerous to human life. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights group, has said at least seven Palestinians have perished because of the improper use of tear gas. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> puts the number of deaths caused by tear gas at 13 since the uprising began. At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in clashes and attacks since Dec. 8. _ Israeli troops closed down the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> institution, the 1,000-member A <ORGANIZATION> Najah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, for allegedly conducting illegal high school classes <PERSON> Saed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, the head of the institute, said, `` Obviously the army wants our people to remain uneducated. What we were doing is not a crime. We were teaching our children instead of leaving them to the streets.'' The army has closed elementary, junior high and high schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> contending they are used to provoke anti-Israeli protests. _ <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said security forces arrested four Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, including two journalists It identified the journalists as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> el <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> who worked for <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Zouheikeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shaab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaab </PERSON> are pro-Palestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> newspapers published in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police accused <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON>, deputy head of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, with broadcasting a call to worshipers to fight Jews working on an archaeological dig near two of the city's mosques, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> He said police plan to indict <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> on a charge of inciting violence. <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> would be the highest-ranking Moslem official to be tried by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since it captured <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` What I did is not incitement. It is the right of Moslems to come to their holy place and defend it,'' said <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> in an interview. `` They crucified <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Now they want to do the same to me.'' On July 3, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians enraged by the dig near <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>, which houses two of Islam's holiest shrines, the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> and Dome of the Rock mosques. Through loudspeakers at the site, Moslem officials _ including <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> _ urged Palestinians praying at the site to defend the shrines, saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> planned to dig a tunnel to the temple. Israeli officials denied they were doing that and said the purpose of the dig was to open an underground staircase along the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION>, which is Judaism's holiest site and borders the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli officials acknowledged they did not coordinate the dig with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and excavations were suspended temporarily. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected an appeal by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> human rights group, Law in the Service of Man, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> restore international telephone and telex lines to the Israeli-occupied lands. The lines were cut March 18. The army argued at the time that the step was necessary because the uprising was being directed and financed from abroad. The human rights group argued that the order violated freedom of speech and constituted collective punishment. `` This is another form of harassment of Palestinians,'' said <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbluth </PERSON>, a member of Law in the Service of Man, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> affiliate of the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man carrying what police thought was a bomb containing dynamite was arrested Monday shortly before a campaign appearance by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the device, which looked like several sticks of dynamite wrapped in duct tape, turned out to be fake. `` It was made up to look like a bomb. It would have fooled me and anybody else,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huse </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> field office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. A 38-year-old <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> man was arrested on charges of interfering with a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent and was held at the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office pending arraignment later Monday, <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know the man's reasons for having the device. `` We hesitate to speculate until an investigation is complete,'' <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. Because of the incident, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was delayed and he missed a scheduled walk in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>'s Polish Day Parade, <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. Instead, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gave a five-minute speech at the reviewing stand before leaving. The man was seen at a bar near the parade reviewing stand by someone who saw what looked like a bomb and reported it to police. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s bomb squad removed the device, which was contained in a paper bag, and determined it was a fake, <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. Another man was taken into custody but was released after police determined he knew nothing of the incident, <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaign officials referred on questions regarding the incident to the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Textile Workers, Teachers Strike for Higher Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 500 striking textile workers demonstrated outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for higher pay and new factory management. In <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, officials made their harshest criticism to date of `` Albanian nationalists'' living in the southern <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. The texile workers, most of them women, were from the Sloga mill in <LOCATION> Zrenjanin </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, which was shut down by a strike last Wednesday. After assembling outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> they were directed to the nearby Trade Union Building, where they met with Social Affairs Minister <PERSON> Janko </PERSON> <PERSON> Obocki </PERSON>. `` We are not asking for color TV sets, all we want is bread.. for our children,'' worker <PERSON> Snezana </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosko </PERSON> said, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> report. Strikers demanded a doubling of monthly pay, which now averages $ 72, and replacement of the plant management. <PERSON> Obocki </PERSON> promised the government would find a way to curb inflation, now running at an annual rate of 190 percent, and increase real earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. Teacher strikes prevented the new school year from beginning in many parts of the country, newspapers reported Monday. Nearly 14,000 elementary school students in <LOCATION> Mostar </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, returned home after finding classrooms locked because of a walkout by 500 teachers demanding `` significant improvements of their monthly wages,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> said. Other teachers' strikes were reported at <LOCATION> Doboj </LOCATION>, 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said, and in the northern port of <LOCATION> Rijeka </LOCATION> and several other Croatian towns. About 850 strikes have taken place in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> over the past eight months, according to government figures. Officials claim no alternative exists to the austerity program imposed in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> if <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is to repay its $ 21 billion foreign debt and revive its faltering economy. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gracanin </PERSON>, demanded that more soldiers be sent to restive <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where 90 percent of the people are ethnic Albanians, to counter what he called `` terror unprecedented in postwar <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.'' His speech followed weekend rallies by more than 100,000 people in four Serbian towns, protesting alleged intimidation by ethnic Albanians. <PERSON> Gracanin </PERSON>, who holds the rank of general in the Yugoslav army, complained of `` impossible conditions for life and work'' of ethnic Serbians and Montenegrins in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. Riots by ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> broke out in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> in 1981 and troops were sent to stop them.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in an unabashedly patriotic kickoff to the fall campaign, stood Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> and declared that he and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` proudly and unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of Allegiance.'' `` To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, who attacked Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a bill to penalize <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> teachers who refuse to lead students in the pledge. The speech at the base of the statue was disrupted briefly by a small band of demonstrators who held signs reading `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' and chanted, `` 40,000 dead from AIDS. Where was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>?'' The Republicans have used the pledge as a rallying point in the campaign. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said `` the center of our debate is not the question of anyone's patriotism or love of country.'' But, he said: `` The people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> want to know the kind of values that underscore our beliefs, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I proudly and unapologetically embrace the values embodied in the Pledge of Allegiance.'' In vetoing the pledge bill in 1977, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited an advisory opinion by <LOCATION> Massachusett </LOCATION>'s highest court that it was unconstitutional, as well as a 1943 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that students could not be forced to recite the pledge and salute the flag. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` hides behind an advisory judicial opinion which has no force of law.'' The `` mindset that would impede the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance is ... the same mindset that could well sterilize public education of its proper role as a transmitter of the values and standards upon which we must rely _ and which have been central throughout our history,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. About 30 protesters from the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power -LRB- ACTUP -RRB-, a gay rights group, tried to drown out <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech. They were immediately surrounded by hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> supporters, who began a counter-chant: `` We want Quayle!'' The group said it was protesting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s vote last year against a $ 30 million appropriation for federal funding of AZT, an experimental drug used in treating victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides said later that he had voted to kill an amendment to the 1987 supplemental appropriations bill to provide AZT free to AIDS patients. But they said he did so on procedural grounds because he did not think such an amendment belonged on an appropriations measure. They said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had voted this year for an appropriations measure that provides $ 1.2 billion for AIDS research, treatment, prevention and education, and had `` an exemplary'' voting record on AIDS. As the demonstrators were hustled away, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the cheering audience, `` I believe in freedom of speech. They have a right to freedom of speech, but so do I.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator chose <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the statue stands in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, for his Labor Day kickoff to the fall campaign. He also toured neighboring <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where millions of immigrants entered the country and which is now undergoing restoration. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and three children posed for photographs with a group of people dressed in costumes of their native countries, and then rode by boat to <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. It was in the nearby <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that candidate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> kicked off his fall campaign for the presidency on Labor Day 1980. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> circled Liberty Island Saturday and paid a nostalgic visit to <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> with his 85-year-old mother, <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, who passed through its processing center 75 years ago as a child emigrating from <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> too late to participate in a Polish American Day parade in the enclave of <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>. But he addressed those who had gathered for the parade, telling them that `` We will never give up until there's freedom again in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who wore a button with the name of the Polish labor union Solidarity, got only a tepid reception from the group, many of whom booed the candidate and heckled him as he spoke. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that shortly before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arrival, a man was arrested near the parade reviewing stand when he was seen carrying what appeared to be a bomb containing sticks of dynamite. The device turned out to be a fake. The 38-year-old <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> man was arrested on charges of interfering with a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent and was held at the service's office, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huse </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> field office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.

 A Sikh policeman convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to reconsider his death sentence. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who faces death by hanging, also asked for a new trial in the petition he filed with the nation's highest court, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The court on Aug. 3 rejected an earlier appeal of <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s conviction by a lower court. But prisoners who have been condemned to death are entitled to a final review by the same judges. <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a Sikh government official found guilty of conspiracy in the assassination, also was sentenced to the gallows and filed a similiar review petition on Aug. 30. If the review petitions are rejected by the high court, the condemned men can make a final appeal to President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated at her home on Oct. 31, 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, apparently in revenge for an army raid she ordered four months earlier to put down the Sikh revolt in the northern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was killed and <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> injured in a shoot-out with other security men minutes after the prime minister's slaying. Police sub-inspector <PERSON> Balbir </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a guard at the prime minister's residence, had also been convicted and sentenced to death by lower courts but the conviction was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 30. The defendants are not related. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion in the Punjabi language, is part of every Sikh male's name by doctrine of the faith. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> had ordered the storming of <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>'s main temple, the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, to clear the shrine of militants Sikhs campaigning for an independent homeland in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the army action.

<HEAD>Archbishop Denounces Police Response to Bomb Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> criticized police Monday for suggesting that a bomb blast at the headquarters of several anti-apartheid groups was caused by explosives stored in the building. Police officials made the suggestion last week following the Aug. 31 explosion that wrecked <ORGANIZATION> Khotso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a six-story office building in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> used by the South African Council of Churches and several human rights groups. Police said investigators had been unable to get through the rubble to the section of an underground garage where the bomb was believed to have been placed. But they suggested explosives were being stored in the building for use elsewhere. Building occupants said they believe the bombers were right-wing extremists or even security force members. `` The police have implied that those who work in <LOCATION> Khotso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> are perpetrators of violence,'' said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, leader of the Anglican church in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It is an absolutely disgraceful suggestion to make, and it is made worse by the fact the police have made it without a tittle of evidence and before doing any proper investigation,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We are still waiting to hear the government's clear condemnation of the bombing.'' He said the bombing should be viewed in the context of a claim by military commanders last week that the army was beyond the jurisdiction of the courts because <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was in a state of war. On Sunday, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> deliberately defied a government ban on calls for voting boycotts, urging blacks and whites to stay away from the polls in next month's nationwide municipal elections. State-of-emergency regulations provide for a jail sentence of up to 10 years for promoting election boycotts. A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, said the text of <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s speech would be studied. He declined to comment on possible action against the black archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials. Many anti-apartheid activists oppose black participation in any local or regional elections as long as blacks are excluded from national elections. Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national affairs, although the 26 million blacks make up about 75 percent of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s population. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 Longtime watchers of the Miss America Pageant may notice a few changes during Saturday's contest, including `` swimsuit strolls'' and an `` improved'' final crowning moment. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON>, the production manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION>, has been testing new ideas in local contests in the past year. Other changes will be a deeper set on the stage and a Y-shaped runway `` that will give us more flexibility in production numbers,'' <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said during a rehearsal break last week. But a more daring innovation is in the swimsuit competition, he said. `` Instead of standing in front of the judges and ` ankling up,' as we called it, we're going to have the girls do a ` walking turn' and not stop at all,'' <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said `` We're de-emphasizing that ` inspection' image that it had for so long.'' The changes in this year's pageant, scheduled to be televised nationally by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, came largely from `` brainstorming'' sessions held in the past year after the appointment of the pageant's new executive director, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> recalled that <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> almost immediately came in and listed all the things he did n't like about the pageant production in years past. `` It's exciting _ there's a lot of change,'' <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. `` We're going back to the days when the top contestants were asked questions on stage _ and these wo n't be ` airhead' questions.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the questions `` will be intelligent questions. We're not going to be testing them on current events, but they wo n't be silly questions either. The final moments of the competition will also be different than in recent years, <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. Traditionally, the fourth, third, second and first runners-up were announced, and then the new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was announced from the remaining six contestants. This year, the fourth, third and second runners-up will be announced, and then, to heighten the drama, the remaining six contestants will be narrowed down to two. The first runner-up will then be announced, leaving the new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. `` The interplay between the two young ladies promises to be good,'' he said. `` We've tested this in some of the states and it's worked well. The pageant production will also have one fewer song-and-dance number, <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. `` The show is supposed to focus on 51 young, talented ladies, so we're including them in all the production numbers,'' he said. The time saved from dropping that number will allow the producer to include brief video spots of the top 10 finalists' interviews before the judges, <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. `` I got the idea to include parts of the contestants' interviews from the Winter Olympics, when we saw some backstage interviews before the athlete went out on the ice or snow,'' he said. The `` Miss America Moments'' that used to come before each commercial break _ which simply told viewers what part of the contest was next _ will be replaced with short spots on what former state winners are now doing, <PERSON> Caligari </PERSON> said. Some of those women include a town mayor, an assistant district attorney, a Broadway understudy and an aeronautical engineer, he said.

Radio Liberation, in a broadcast monitored here, said, `` A strong and suspicious mobilization of Sandinista army troops ... to the interior of that province -LRB- <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> -RRB- was denounced by campesino families.'' `` The Sandinistas are sending more patrols to those places, taking advantage of the fact that the rebels forces have retreated to the border zones with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' it said. It is estimated that some 9,000 rebel fighters have returned to base camps on the Honduran side of the border and about 2,000 are still operating in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The rebels, known as Contras, began returning to their camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in April after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government and <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to a temporary cease-fire and negotiations for a permanent truce. The peace talks broke down in June. In <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> the Contras are given U.S.-supplied food and non-lethal assistance. Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said last week Contras who had left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were concentrated near the border. He said Sandinista army units are maintaining `` a normal defense'' along the frontier and claimed they were constantly harassed by Contras and Honduran troops seeking to provoke a border conflict. Sandinista forces have frequently made sweeps through <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> to dislodge Contras and drive them out of the province.

 Most of the 22 investigators seeking the cause of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> crash that killed 13 people last week returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but several stayed behind to retrieve more pieces of wreckage. Some of the investigators hoped to question the plane's captain, but <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Matney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Parkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said on Monday Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was to undergo surgery this week and an interview was not scheduled. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team members hope that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> can answer lingering questions about Flight 1141, which crashed and burned within seconds of takeoff Wednesday at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Ninety-five people aboard the plane bound for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> survived, inlcuding the three members of the cockpit crew. At the airport, huge mechanical jaws chewed through the left wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 jet and a bulldozer hauled it away. `` Right now it's wreckage work, preparatory to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s releasing it to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dealey </PERSON>, spokesman for the airport <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said he was unsure when the fuselage would be removed and where it would go, but said it would be inspected to determine the condition of the passenger seats and the extent of fire damage they suffered. Although most of the 22 federal investigators returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the Labor Day weekend, several remained in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` A good number are there that are just finishing up in terms of collecting, typing up their notes,'' said <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. `` This is a difficult accident.'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said the same group of investigators who spoke with the crew's first officer and an injured flight attendant would question <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. However, they may have to return to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to speak with the captain. Investigators have evidence indicating that the wing flaps were completely or almost completely retracted. But they were told by Flight Engineer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> that the wing flaps were extended in the proper position for takeoff. During a briefing Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said more evidence had been collected on the position of the wing flaps. `` We have further verification that the flaps were retracted,'' he said. Pilots said if the wing flaps were retracted that could be a sign the crew was trying to fly the plane on one engine. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> refused to speculate on reports that two engines failed. A recording of cockpit crew members showed they mentioned engine failure. The plane's cockpit remained at the site Monday, sealed in a plastic blue tarpaulin adjacent to a row of seats pulled from the plane. The cockpit was to be hauled to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, but officials decided to leave it at the airport, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` We found a hangar we will put it in,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` We'll be able to do the work there on site and wo n't have to go through shipping and those problems.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with liberal anti-war activist <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> on Monday and attacked his Democratic rival's views on defense, the economy, taxes, crime and the death penalty. Plunging into the final nine weeks of the neck-and-neck race for president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned up the rhetorical heat on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` How gloomy he is'' about the economy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views on defense were `` the standard litany of the liberal left'' and his attitude about new weapons was `` governed by blind negative ideology.'' `` I would n't be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise is something you find in <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s workout book,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, an actress now best known for producing exercise books and videotapes, infuriated many people during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war by traveling to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and posing with North Vietnamese military personnel to dramatize her opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Highlighting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s pro-defense stance, two aircraft carriers rested at anchor across the harbor as the vice president spoke to a sun-drenched Labor Day audience of several hundred people outside a wholesale fish company. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, the head of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said the vice president was trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the state by three to seven points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance was marred by several dozen noisy protesters carrying Dukakis-Bentsen signs and chanting, `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' and `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Employees of the fish company held up cardboard boxes to block the demonstrators from cameramen until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides ordered the shields taken down. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and police said that a man with a stun gun hanging from his belt was taken into custody. `` Right now it appears there was no danger involved to the vice president,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergek </PERSON>, the special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> field office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secret Service. `` The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice president or anyone else there,'' <PERSON> Sergek </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day by touring the <ORGANIZATION> Chesapeake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a family owned wholesale fish processing concern whose booming sales are attributed in part to heavy demand from sushi restaurants in the area. Later, he traveled to <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and gave a <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> send-off to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic athletes headed for the Summer Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` You're representing a country that is wide open and free as a breeze, where the millionaire has no more vote than the pauper and where even school children know the words: ` I know my rights,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, surrounded by the athletes and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters. The vice president rounded out the day by attending a holiday picnic with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> policemen. `` I mean to win this election,'' he declared. Cheered by the lawmen and their families, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for tougher sentences for criminals, including the death penalty for people convicted of killing police officers. `` I will appoint to the federal bench judges who have a little more concern about the victims of crime and a little less concern about the criminals,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> audience, `` This campaign is about many things, but if I had to set some priorities, I'd say -LRB- it is -RRB- foremost about jobs and peace. It's about protecting the gains that we've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make new breakthroughs in both areas.'' He credited the Reagan-Bush administration with creating 17 -LCB- million new jobs since the end of the 1981-82 recession and scorned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's criticism of the economy. `` All my opponent can do is try to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people how bad everything is,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On the subject of crime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would turn the clock back to `` the fuzzy old days of liberal thinking'' when the perpetrators of crime, rather than its victims, were viewed with more compassion. `` To the people of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, let me put it this way: If you loved <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, you'll love my opponent. They oppose the death penalty, no matter how brutal the crime that's been committed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> chief justice who was voted off the bench by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s voters in a campaign that highlighted Ms. <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>'s liberal views on criminal matters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also lambasted the prison furlough program in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and said that `` no more furloughs for people who rape, pillage and plunder in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' On defense matters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing the MX and Midgetman missiles, the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intiaitive </ORGANIZATION> and two new aircraft carriers. `` We've got to look at every new idea and every defense system from the point of view of, ` will it work, does it make sense and do we need it to make our country safer? `` If the answers are ` yes,' then at least it warrants our most serious attention and then sorting out our financial priorities,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't just dismiss every new idea with a breezy, ` We already have enough weapons.''' On pocketbook issues, he said that his primary goal will be to provide a job to all Americans. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged anew to resist any move in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to increase federal spending and government regulation of business. `` And when they say I'll raise taxes, I will say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no again, and they'll push again, and finally I'll say: ` Read my lips _ no new taxes. `` Why do you think they call it Taxachusetts?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to state tax increases in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Underscoring the importance of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the White House sweepstakes, and its cache of 47 <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> votes _ the biggest prize in the country _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It's going to be a long, tough fight,'' and added: `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, here I come.''

<HEAD>Six Still Missing After Ramstein Disaster; Death Toll At 52</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The death toll from the <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> air show disaster has climbed to 52, and a West German official said Monday that six people reported missing after the fiery tragedy still have not been located. More than 400 missing person reports were filed within two days after the Aug. 28 air crash, and police have closed almost all of the cases. `` There are six people missing still,'' said <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Rhineland-Palatinate </LOCATION> state, where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Air Base at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> is located. But he said that does not mean the six West Germans are victims of the crash. `` Perhaps they went to the air show at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> and then went on holiday without informing anyone,'' <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` And it's not even certain they were at the air show.'' West German federal police as well as <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police agency, are helping in the search, <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said `` a few'' of the people initially reported missing were found among bodies that at first could not be identified. He said others were located among the wounded who were unable to communicate because of their injuries. He said most of the missing person reports were resolved after those who filed the reports got calls from their relatives saying they were all right. Meanwhile, another person died on Sunday from severe burns suffered when three Italian fighter planes crashed during an aerial acrobatic display and one of the aircraft plunged into the crowd. The latest death brings the death toll to 52. The dead include the three Italian pilots involved in the crash, 45 Germans, two Americans, and one victim each from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> said seven of the fatalities were children, 12 were women and 33 were men. He said 164 people remain hospitalized. `` Thirty of those have serious injuries, and of the 30 some have life-threatening conditions,'' <PERSON> Dietzen </PERSON> told the The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Seven Americans hospitalized at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> medical center in nearby <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION> are in `` good condition,'' a hospital spokeswoman said. `` They're able to sit up and talk,'' <LOCATION> Landstuhl </LOCATION> hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> could not say when the patients, still being treated for burns, would be released.

 Crews cleared mudslides from roads Monday and took food and other supplies to thousands of people stranded in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by floods that killed at least 28 people. At least 16 of the dead and the largest group of homeless, 25,000, were in northern <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state, which took the brunt of Hurricane Debby on Friday, said Maj. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Medel </PERSON>, assistant state public security director. The hurricane dissipated after coming ashore from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, but rain continued Monday in much of the region and in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Flood waters were reported subsiding in some areas, but officials said they feared rain in the mountains would make the waters rise again. Mud and rock loosened by more than a week of rain slid onto roads, blocking or slowing traffic on several major highways. Most of the casualties and displaced people lived between <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and just inland. <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> struck land in that area. Among the dead was a 3-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, killed Saturday when a wall of her home fell on her, said <PERSON> Matilde </PERSON> <PERSON> Albino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>. She said parts of the town remained under 4 -LCB- feet of water. About 8,000 of the homeless were in <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>, 15 miles inland from <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Guadalupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> state government. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Medel </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Cazones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed Monday, cutting the coast road between <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. No estimates of total damage were available. About 600 people fled their homes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> late Sunday when rivers flooded but they were returning Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker said. <PERSON> Jore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, the mayor of <LOCATION> Poza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, 22 miles south of <LOCATION> Tuxpan </LOCATION>, said people were repairing their homes and cleaning away the mud. He said a number of houses built on the banks of gullies that cut through the city of 300,000 people were washed away, but he did not have a specific number. Relief teams were using boats to deliver supplies to towns that could not be reached by road, he added. Light rain continued on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, where Hurricane <PERSON> Kristy </PERSON> dumped rain last week but never went ashore, the national weather service said. The resort of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo was isolated for a third day, stranding hundreds of tourists. Crews drained water from runways but bad weather prevented flights, said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> state government spokesman. Highways up the coast to <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, south to <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> and inland to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were damaged or blocked by mudslides, he said. He estimated 3,000 to 4,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in the state and said: `` Some communities are isolated, without telephones or road access mainly because of the rain. The army is giving assistance everywhere. Brigades from the state government have been checking communities since Saturday night, but communication is bad.'' More than 20,000 people were evacuated or lost their homes in <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from the state on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s southern border.

 Residents are wondering whether one of their neighbors in this town of 14,500 will step forward and claim the world's largest single lottery jackpot. The winning ticket for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 54 million Lotto prize was bought at one of <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION>'s 24 lottery outlets, lottery officials said. Some people are so curious about the winner's identity that they've flagged down police officers on patrol. `` People are really interested,'' said officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmert </PERSON>. `` We're up in the air. We're just as curious as anybody else.'' Residents may have to wait a while. Last month, it took <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> 10 days to step forward and identify herself as the winner of a $ 26 million jackpot. Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery offices are closed until Tuesday. Although lottery officials ca n't project the exact payout until Tuesday, the annual payment to one winner would be about $ 2.16 million each year after taxes, using a lottery department formula that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of the yearly windfall for taxes. <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said he was pleased the winning ticket was bought in his town, once known as the poultry capital of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It might put <ORGANIZATION> Longwood </ORGANIZATION> on the map now,'' he said. `` Whether they just bought the ticket here or whether they live here, it means a lot to a community like this. `` We're going to take the credit. It feels good.'' The week's lottery frenzy was a bonanza for promoting the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery, which has set numerous sales records in its first year and attracted worldwide attention. The huge jackpot pushed Saturday sales to 14.6 million and total weekly Lotto purchases to 44.78 million. The jackpot for this week's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Lotto drawing will begin at $ 7 million. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jackpot topped the previous record prize for a numbers game, the $ 51.4 million shared by two people who bought winning tickets for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s lottery on June 4. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s single-ticket win also set a record for the largest individual Lotto prize, beating the $ 46 million won on one ticket in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery in October 1987.

<TEXT>
 More than one-quarter of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s postal workers walked off their jobs Monday as a nationwide mail strike spread and prevented the delivery of 65 million foreign and domestic letters and parcels. Three postal workers were arrested in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, one of 40 cities where sorting offices were paralyzed by the strikes by 48,000 workers, said the national post office, Royal Mail. Royal Mail, which handles 51 million items of mail daily, said the three were charged with disorderly behavior after bottles were thrown from a picket line at arriving temporary workers. It was the first instance of violence in six days of strikes that began Wednesday with a 24-hour strike to protest regional pay differences. The one-day strike officially ended, but the issue of temporary workers hired to clear backlogs has continued to keep workers away from their jobs. On Monday, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> were among cities where mail could not be collected, posted, sorted or delivered due to walkouts by 48,000 of 140,000 sorting and collecting workers. Stamps could be purchased because 40,000 administration and counter workers have not gone on strike. International mail was completely suspended `` until further notice'' after walkouts at sorting offices for foreign mail in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and other cities, said post office spokeswoman <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said although workers at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport office had gone back to work, other offices were not in operation. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cockburn </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION>, defended the hiring of 3,500 temporary workers, saying the number hired exceeded by only 500 the number used at other peak times such as Christmas. But <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said the dispute could escalate further, and the whole system could be stopped by midweek. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said exploratory talks between the union and management were scheduled for Monday night to `` see whether there is a basis for further negotiations.'' Union leaders met in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> earlier Monday to decide their course of action, union officials said. The strike Wednesday centered on union objections to the post office offering weekly bonuses of 7.5 pounds to 20 pounds -LRB- $ 12.52 to $ 33.40 -RRB- to recruit workers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The union said it would not tolerate regional pay differences and any bonuses should be paid nationally. In another British labor dispute, the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted overwhelmingly Monday to expel the electricians' union, its first ouster of an affiliate in 15 years. Delegates of the electricians' 336,000-member union showed their disdain by walking out minutes before the vote. The vote, by a show of hands, came on the opening day of the Trades Union's week-long annual conference in <LOCATION> Bournemouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The Electronic, <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> was ousted for signing two single-union, no-strike pacts with management in violation of Trades Union policy. Under such agreements a plant's work force is represented by a single union and disputes are settled by arbitration The Trades Union policy is that such contracts weaken union bargaining power and lead to competition among unions for representation in a shrinking job market.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven months of talks between the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of moderate Roman Catholics and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, have broken down, both parties said Monday. The closed-door talks on the future of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> foundered largely as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to renounce violence by the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said. <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had carried out the negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has stepped up attacks on British security forces. It has killed 27 military men this year in attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while 11 <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have been killed by British soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed on both sides of the Irish border, wants to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnmuber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. The <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> also wants to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> with the republic but by peaceful means. Both sides said disagreement also arose over two other issues. One was the <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that the province's <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority should have the veto power over <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s future. The other was <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> insistence that since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed in November 1985, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s role in the province has been a neutral one. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that maintaining that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` is now a neutral party to the conflict ... ignores all the historical evidence of British domination in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and is wholly contradicted by the events of the past 20 years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> said it was dismayed to find the <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> accepted existence of a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> veto over the future of the province. Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> was given a formal consultative role in running the province. In exchange, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> accepted long-term British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> by acknowledging no change can be made in its status until a majority of people there agree. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> pledged to withdraw from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> once a majority of people there indicate they want it to do so. An <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> statement said: `` Violence, or what <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> called ` armed struggle,' is wrong and has no contribution to make to a resolution of the conflict in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Even in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s terms, justification no longer exists for the use of such methods. There are no obstacles on the road to achieving their political objectives which justify the use of armed force.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> said it and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> agreed `` the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> people as a whole have the right to national self-determination.'' But it said the violence `` is directly responsible for more fatalities in the Roman Catholic community in the past 10 years than either the security forces or the ... -LRB- Protestant extremists -RRB-. It also bears much responsibility for the massive unemployment and deprivation in the Catholic community.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> statement said the question, on which both parties agreed, was `` how do we end the British presence in a manner which leaves behind a stable and peaceful Ireland.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s government in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> said in a statement it shared <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>'s disappointment that the <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to extend the political peace process had not succeeded. There was no immediate reaction from the British government.

<TEXT>
 Demonstrators in wheelchairs blocked Greyhound terminals in several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities Monday claiming buses are inaccessible to disabled riders, and several landed in jail when they refused police orders to move. In some cases, demonstrators organized by American Disabled for <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, or ADAPT, blocked Labor Day travelers' entry to buses, police said. `` This is a very busy day for us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON>, a spokesman for Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a holiday weekend. People are going home and thousands of people are being inconvenienced because buses are being delayed.'' Five protesters in wheelchairs and one blind demonstrator were arrested in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and taken to jail, said police Sgt. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. A jailer said $ 213 bond each was set, but she did not know how many were jailed. Arrests also occurred in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and an organizer said the protests occurred in a dozen cities. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carley </PERSON>, a demonstrator at the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> terminal, said society has `` spent thousands of dollars keeping us alive and they say, ` We have spent this money to keep you alive we're not going to spend any money to see that you can live.' And accessibility is living.'' Protesters want Greyhound to install lifts on buses to make them more accessible to the handicapped. `` We're asking them to sign an agreement that any new bus built will be accessible,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, an ADAPT spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Greyhound officials met with leaders of the Denver-based ADAPT in August. `` We went through all of this in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. `` We thought we responded in a forthright way to issues they raised. We are disappointed obviously that the demonstrations continued.'' In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 10 people, including eight in wheelchairs, were cited for disturbing the peace. The protest shifted to the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Jail after police officers booked the two able-bodied people, but released those in wheelchairs, said <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>. Two hours later, they too were released, and a police officer at the scene told the protesters they had been booked due to a misunderstanding. In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a protest involving 25 people resulted in the arrest of eight demonstrators, six in wheelchairs. The eight were charged with failure to disperse and obstruction of a highway and released on their own recognizance. <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said protests also were scheduled Monday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Another demonstration was set for Tuesday at the Greyhound terminal in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said a Greyhound subsidiary has applied for a grant to use toward designing an exprimental bus that would be accessible to the disabled. He said the company has proposed enlisiting the help of an advisory group that would include ADAPT members, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for The Handicapped, and a retired people's group. Greyhound operates Helping Hands, a program that provides a free ticket for disabled people who are unable to travel by themselves. But to avoid fraudulent use of the program, the bus carrier requires users to provide proof of their disability, <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. `` This handicapped organization feels that's demeaning and they ought to be the judge of whether they travel alone,'' <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. ADAPT also objects to Greyhound's requirements that non-motorized wheelchairs be stored in baggage compartments and battery-operated wheelchairs be kept off buses. Greyhound cites concerns about battery acid leaking.

<HEAD>Non-Aligned Proposal Calls For Sanctions Against Israel, South

<TEXT>
 Foreign ministers preparing Monday for the non-aligned movement conference discussed proposals that contain sanctions against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The five-day conference of foreign ministers is to chart the 101-member organization's role over the next decade. Organizers said 92 members plan to attend, including 70 foreign ministers. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilou </PERSON> formally opens the three-day conference on Wednesday. But delegates on Monday began considering a 60-page draft resolution dealing with international problems. The draft sharply criticizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, echoing previous sentiments of the movement. A copy of the draft notes that since the non-aligned summit conference last year the situation in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` has worsened considerably, particularly as a result of the actions of the Israeli occupation forces against the civilian population in the occupied territories.'' The draft `` salutes the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people,'' in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It says the Arab uprising in the occupied lands that began Dec. 8 is `` tangible evidence of their determination to have a state of their own.'' It demands <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The draft also expresses `` profound alarm at the sharp deterioration of the situation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and repeats previous demands for sanctions against the South African government, which is controlled by the country's white minority. The resolution expresses satisfaction with the July 20 cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and states the U.N.-mediated peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> should lead to a `` a comprehensive and lasting solution'' in the 8-year-old war between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> rivals. The draft makes no reference to Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the war. Conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> is expected to demand <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s condemnation on that issue when he addresses the conference on Wednesday. More than 1,500 police officers, including special anti-terrorist units, have been assigned to guard the conference center where the meeting is being held and the delegates' hotels.

 Officials still had not determined Monday what caused a mysterious outbreak that sent 119 young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruits to the hospital over the weekend with breathing problems, vomiting and other symptoms. Only one of the recruits remained in a hospital after two were released Monday. The enlisted men from the Naval Training Center were taken to 10 hospitals in more than 50 ambulances Saturday, and all but three were released by Sunday night. Two more men were released Monday in good condition from <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabrillo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmonson </PERSON>. A third recruit who was diagnosed with pneumonia was still being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Balboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Luchka </PERSON>. `` It could have been that one or two people had a viral infection and got sick, which caused a mass hysteria to the others,'' <PERSON> Luchka </PERSON> said. A hysterical reaction was `` very possible, like in second grade, when someone vomits and the whole class starts vomiting,'' <PERSON> Luchka </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials also speculated whether the symptoms may have been brought on by the extreme heat, heavy smog and strenuous exercise. Environmental health officials, a hazardous materials unit and a medical unit inspected the barracks but were unable to pinpoint an explanation for the outbreak, said Petty Officer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. Hospital tests failed to reveal any poisons in the recruits' systems, she said The men who returned to the center spent Sunday and Monday relaxing and were to resume their third week of basic training. The week's training schedule included classroom sessions and no physical activity.

<HEAD>More Local Phone Hikes Coming; Consumer Advocates Object</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Local residential telephone rates across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are due to go up twice in the coming months, but state utility consumer advocates are trying to head off the increases before they can take effect. The consumer advocates want the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to cancel increases scheduled for December and next April in the `` line charge'' added to residential phone bills. Their call is being heard by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the state utility commissioners, who at the very least want the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to take a second vote on the added charges before they take effect. The increases _ 60 cents per month on Dec. 1 and 30 cents on April 1, 1989 _ were approved as part of a three-step boost in the monthly line charge that began with a 60-cent increase July 1, 1987. The monthly charge is already $ 2.60. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> approved the increases in April 1987 as a way to further reduce long-distance rates and encourage large business users to stay on the public phone network rather than building their own networks. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocates </ORGANIZATION> is asking the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to cancel the future increases _ amounting to about $ 1 billion a year _ saying they are `` unnecessary, unsupported and unwarranted.'' The association said three telecommunications analysts commissioned by the group to study a June report compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on the effects of the subscriber line charge concluded that the threat of large users bypassing the local phone network has not materialized. Increasing the charge by 90 cents will have no effect on the bypass that is already occurring, they said. `` We've really attacked the very basis for the subscriber line charge,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Binz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> consumer counsel. The line charge helps pay the cost of the wire that connects a customer's telephone with a phone company's central office. Part of the cost of that line also is subsidized with long-distance rates, so raising the proportion paid by subscribers reduces long-distance rates. Long-distance rates have dropped more than 30 percent since the charge was imposed in 1985. Raising the line charge also reduces local connection fees paid by large business users. Some businesses find it economical to build their own telecommunications networks and bypass the public phone network. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> continues to support the subscriber line charge and the underlying policy of shifting the costs of the local phone network to subscribers, said <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. `` The policy ... has worked very well. Bypass has not grown and it has caused rates overall to come down considerably, and we have not seen evidence to cause us to change course,'' he said. The agency, however, will `` look very carefully'' at the consumer advocates' requests to cancel the scheduled increases, he said. But the consumer advocates' group has already taken its case to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where it is talking to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> members of the communications committees, most of whom opposed the original imposition of the line charge at $ 1 in June 1985 and the later increases. The issue `` has caught <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' eye,'' said <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Salemme </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee, particularly because of concerns about an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> proposal to give <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies more financial flexibility by capping rates but lifting the lid on profits <PERSON> Salemme </PERSON> said that if price caps were adopted, regulators would have little or no assurance that the line-charge increases were being passed along in the form of reduced long-distance rates. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> is urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> into taking a second vote on the further increases after reviewing the effects of the current charges. `` There is still a lot of healthy skepticism'' among state regulatory commissioners about the need for further increases in the line charge, said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, chairwoman of the association's communications committee and head of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state utilities commission. `` They've been very dubious about this from the very beginning,'' she said.

<HEAD>Report: Young Families Suffer Economically</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High poverty rates for young families are getting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth off to `` the worst possible start,'' warns the head of a group promoting the interests of children. `` Our children and our young families are this nation's growing edge. We neglect them at our peril,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, president of the Children's Defense Fund. The comments came with the release of a study commissioned by the group, which found that the economic growth of the last few years has n't benefited young <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s young families are afflicted by an economic depression in the middle of our society's more general prosperity,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said in a statement. In terms of constant dollars, the income of families with children headed by an adult under age 30 fell by about one-fourth between 1973 and 1986, the fund reported. As a result the poverty rate for such families nearly doubled from 12 percent in 1973 to 22 percent in 1986, the fund said. Census Bureau figures for 1987 were released last week and, while not identical to the children's fund figures, tend to support the group's assertions. The Census Bureau found that the 1987 poverty rate for children aged 18 and under was 20 percent, up from 14.2 percent in 1973. Younger families tended to have higher poverty rates than older ones, the census figures showed. Poverty rates for children, whether black, white or Hispanic, rose between 1973 and 1987, the figures showed, and were higher than for other families or individuals. `` These are the children on whom we must rely to be the workers, leaders, parents, taxpayers, soldiers and hope of the 21st century,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. `` We are getting them off to the worst possible start.'' In the short term, the Children's Defense Fund called for a higher minimum wage and passage of the Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, legislation pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to improve services for working parents. Long-term recommendations included extending Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children in families with less than twice the poverty income; expanded tax credits for low-income families; expanded Head Start programs; setting up community learning centers for children, and a series of educational and home-buyer assistance programs. The fund describes itself as a non-profit group working to draw attention to the needs of children, particularly the poor, minorities and handicapped.

<HEAD>Dollar Steadies After Friday's Falls; Gold Slightly Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar opened lower today after losing ground Friday on higher-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment data. Gold was slightly weaker. Trading on European markets was lulled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Day holiday, dealers said. The dollar had fallen sharply on Friday after news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July. It lost more than a pfennig against the West German mark, a centime against the Swiss franc and 1 -LCB- cents against the Dutch guilder. Traders said they expected the dollar to hold steady through today, but dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> forecast a lower dollar in the medium term. `` We expect a further decline this week,'' said one dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.72 yen to a closing 136.03. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 135.65 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8525 West German marks, down from 1.8665; 1.5593 Swiss francs, down from 1.5725; 6.2985 French francs, down from 6.3365; 2.0933 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1050; 1,378.60 Italian lire, down from 1,388.50; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2362 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.6850, compared with $ 1.6755 Friday. Gold was weakened by private investors, particularly from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, selling bullion, dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. `` It's a familiar pattern,'' said one. `` With the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> out, a few players try to push a thin market.'' Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 428.10 a troy ounce, up from $ 427.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 427. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 426.90, down from $ 428 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 1.54 to close at a bid 429.38. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.48 a troy ounce, down from Friday's $ 6.52.

<HEAD>Little Progress In Subroto Mission On Quota Problem, Survey Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one name is correct</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> has made little headway in his efforts to persuade <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to accept an oil production quota and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to allow its Persian Gulf foe one equal to its own, the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday. But <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was quoted by a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emirates </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Monday as rejecting speculation that he had failed to convince the two countries to curb their output amid over-production by some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> daily quoted <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, now in <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> for talks on curbing over-production, as saying after visiting <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> last week that he `` now fully knows what the two countries want.'' Both countries, economically drained by their 8-year-old war, are now giving top priority to post-war reconstruction funded by their oil revenues. `` This means that the two countries are keen to have a strong and cohesive <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and get a good price for their oil,'' <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The Middle East Economic Survey, published in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s mission to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> was `` no doubt useful in terms of getting acquainted with the positions and preoccupations of the parties.'' But the weekly said <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s talks did not appear to have `` yielded any concrete results'' in settling the Iran-Iraq quota problem. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to accept an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> quota of 1.5 million barrels a day and is demanding parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has a quota of 2.369 million barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11 other members agree that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> should have parity. Although neither side has publicly announced the outcome of <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s talks, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> stressed shortly before <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> arrived in the Iranian capital that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would never agree to allow <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> an equal quota. `` The allocation of an equal quota for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is entirely unprincipled ... Quota parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is in fact a kind of increase in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> quota,'' the radio commentary noted. The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry newsletter, said the key questions in the thorny quota problem were whether or not the Iranians are prepared to accept the principle of quota parity with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and whether `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> itself is willing to accept such a quota and the production discipline it entails.'' The weekly added: `` Neither side, it appears, was in any mood to answer such awkward questions or even to discuss them in anything but very general terms.'' It said that the Iranians `` seemed concerned to steer clear of the parity dilemma altogether'' in their talks with <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s former energy minister. `` Instead they concentrated on the broad spectrum of problems facing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> at present _ particularly over-production by certain member countries _ and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s pressing requirements for reconstruction in the post-war era,'' it said. The newsletter also said the Iraqis stressed their reconstruction needs and `` made it plain to <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> that in their view the question of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s quota is only one of a wide spectrum of important issues facing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' The newsletter noted: `` It would seem ... that, despite <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>'s brave endeavors, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> still has a long, hard road to travel as regards the Iraqi quota impasse and all its other chronic disciplinary ailments.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s current production is estimated at 2.8 million barrels a day, meaning that even if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to quota parity, <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s output would be reduced at a time when it wants to boost production The other major quota violator is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. It has said it wants to produce around 1.5 million barrels a day, more than one-third above its 948,000-barrel quota. The newsletter reported that U.A.E. ouput soared from 1.45 million barrels a day in July to 1.7 million barrels a day last month `` and is programmed to increase still further to 1.95 million barrels a day for September.'' That will heighten pressure on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to solve the over-production problem, which has helped weaken oil prices from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark or $ 18 a barrel to around $ 14 or $ 15. The weekly reported last week that overall <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production was estimated at 20 million barrels a day, more than 3.5 million barrels over the cartel's quota ceiling. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON> as saying that if peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> slowed down `` confidence in the possibility of attaining peace will lead to a letdown on the market and consequently prices will slip.''

 It was a cold November day in 1966 when attorney and expectant-father <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> looked out a downtown hospital window toward the vacant grounds of his alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. The international exposition <PERSON> HemisFair </PERSON> was two years away and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> knew the city needed hotel rooms in the tourist area. So as his daughter was being delivered, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> devised a plan to turn the Colonial Spanish-style campus into a luxury hotel with a view of the popular River Walk. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s gamble in what became La Mansion del Rio paid off. Tourists crowded into the hotel when it opened in April 1968 and have been coming ever since. Today, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is fighting for survival and claiming that one of his lenders, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, backed him into a financial corner to steal his hotels for its own hotel management subsidiary. It's a lawsuit the hotel industry is watching carefully. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s attorneys say his $ 7 billion lawsuit against Metropolitan could be a test case because it charges that a lender, in calculated moves, conspired to become a direct competitor with its borrower. `` My biggest problem with this case is trying to understand why a company with over $ 100 billion worth of assets and 100 years of reputable business dealings would stoop to this practice, and that is the reason I am willing to go through with this lawsuit,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said recently. Metropolitan officials deny any wrongdoing and say the case is a simple contractual agreement that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> broke by not paying his bills on time. `` I think you are seeing an absolute desperation move,'' said Metropolitan's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Seagal </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>. `` What you have is a straight-forward loan. Met breached no agreement with Mr. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is using the lawsuit to avoid a threatened bankruptcy. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s lawsuit charges Metropolitan with fraud, duress, interference, deceptive trade practices, breach of confidential relationships, unfair dealing and conspiracy in what he claims was a concerted nationwide effort by <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> and its Phoenix-based subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to take over regional, profitable hotels at a fraction of their worth. The fight is scheduled for another round in court on Sept. 12, but Metropolitan already claims partial victory from state District Judge <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>'s summary judgment in August that Metropolitan and <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> did not conspire to take over La Mansion. But <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s attorneys are pressing ahead, claiming that Metropolitan wants to postpone a jury trial until 1989 to drain <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s resources. `` If we can get to a jury and show a jury how Metropolitan was telling <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> that they would be taking over La Mansion hotels, even before <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> had any problems, and then put the incredible squeeze on <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>, I think a jury is going to be offended,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Macon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was 36 when he transformed the old campus into a luxury hotel. Success fueled expansion desires and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> approached Metropolitan. In July 1978, the 300-room La Mansion del Norte opened in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> with an $ 8.1 million loan from the insurer. In 1981, Metropolitan refinanced <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mortgage to expand the chain again, increasing his loan to $ 11.25 million. In 1982, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in partnership with an investment group, started construction of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mansion-Austin </ORGANIZATION> financed by Metropolitan servicing agent <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The 300-room <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> hotel opened in April 1984. The three hotels, <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> claims, are worth about $ 80 million. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> alleges that between 1981 and 1984, Metropolitan began thinking of taking over La Mansion after the insurance giant acquired 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION>. With the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy on a slide in the mid-1980s, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s hotels suffered like others During that time, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> alleges, Metropolitan told <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> his hotels were in trouble and could become targets for <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> takeovers. In July 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> contacted him about a franchising plan, but <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> declined the offer, he said. That fall <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> decided to restructure his management company and began talking to his lenders. He claims he could not reach a satisfactory arrangement with Metropolitan. `` We reduced his monthly payments by 50 percent and he claims that we dealt very hard with him,'' said <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON>. The attorney said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 1986 restructuring earned him more than $ 1 million at a time <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> claimed he could n't make payments for his north property. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> talked with other lenders and agreed to give up ownership but retain management control of La Mansion del Rio and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansion-Austin </PERSON>. In the summer of 1987, unable to find an investor in the hotel, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> received an extension on his loan payment from Metropolitan, but by that December, <PERSON> Arnholt </PERSON> declared the loan in default and threatened foreclosure on La Mansion del Norte. The same month, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> posted <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansion-Austin </PERSON> for foreclosure and fired <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s management company. This January, <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> began to manage the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> hotel after <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> claimed it exhausted its search for a management company. In February, Metropolitan planned to foreclose on La Mansion del Norte and <ORGANIZATION> Doubletree </ORGANIZATION> employees prepared to move in, but <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> filed suit, obtained a temporary restraining order and kept Metropolitan from taking over. Now, Metropolitan claims that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is on a free ride, not having paid a dime for the hotel's debt service since 1986 while continuing to draw fees for managing the hotel. Attorneys for both sides said they're not sure what will happen on Sept. 12.

 Case: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wants to replace two assembly plants but keep operations near <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The only available site is in <LOCATION> Poletown </LOCATION> _ and if the company builds there it has to level 1,200 homes and force out 3,500 residents. Case: <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether to support a federal toxic substances control act after one of its pesticides encounters environmental problems. It also must grapple with an internal policy that would restrict some product uses _ and sales. What should a corporate executive do? Spurred in part by complex new moral dilemmas and publicized incidents of criminal wrongdoing, the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is requiring its 800 incoming students this fall to think about those and other ethical questions. Scholars said the three-week mini-course at the 80-year-old graduate school is part of a nationwide trend to devote more resources to teaching and research on moral reasoning and ethical values in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's become sufficiently clear that the business leader of the future is going to have to be conversant and thoughtful about ethics,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodpaster </PERSON>, a philosopher who came to the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 to help develop an ethics curriculum. One goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> course is to make future business leaders consider the impact of their decisions. It joins philosophy with case study to stimulate dialogue on questions that defy easy answers. The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> course will tackle such topics as corporate responsibility in a plant relocation, limits of economic reasoning in environmental waste issues, conflicting cultural values in international business, and organizational pressures against honesty and integrity. What courses at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and other universities do n't do is prescribe a set of morals. You ca n't teach ethics, scholars said; graduate students bring with them values developed over a lifetime. `` We're not trying to make bad people all of a sudden turn into saints,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciulla </PERSON>, a philosopher who teaches ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not coming up with the right answer. It's going through the process and understanding what are the issues and what are the values _ what do we have to think about here?'' Business ethics is n't a new field. In 1915, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> offered a class on `` Social Factors in Business Enterprise.'' After the 1929 stock market crash, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> hired a philosopher to teach ethics as society reacted to the Depression by attacking greed in business. <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON>, which has three ethics specialists, this year for the first time is requiring students to attend two ethics sessions during orientation. International business students take a class on cross-cultural ethics, while the graduate and undergraduate divisions have offered a business ethics course since 1975. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school has required a course on social responsibility since the the mid-1960s, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> has had an applied ethics center for about 20 years and requires first-year students to take a class similar to <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s, while <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> offers an ethics elective. With an increasing number of cases like the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading and the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> defense scandals, those schools are intensifying research in ethics, and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> is hosting a conference on the subject in December. Still, only about 10 percent of business students nationwide are required to study ethics. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> last year received a reported $ 20 million pledge from former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> to study ethics, part of a university-wide program to boost research in the field in the professional schools. Scholars said the study of business over the last 30 years has become more scientific _ numbers-crunching and bottom-line analysis at the expense of ethics, corporate purpose and corporate responsibility. `` I do n't have difficulty putting forth certain values where at least alarms ought to go off,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s senior associate dean for education programs `` But I also think the emphasis should be on the awareness of the breadth of impact.'' Starting in the late 1950s and'60s, business schools emphasized that the goal of a company should be maximizing the individual stockholder's wealth. Now researchers talk about the impact of business decisions on all `` stakeholders'' _ workers, communities, customers, future generations. `` Wherever you draw the line on insider trading, meeting someone in an alley with $ 400,000 in a suitcase is not a hard issue,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Olsson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of Applied Ethics. `` The more important stuff is how do you put ethics in the center of business decision-making every day,'' he said. `` We try to make students understand that in every decision they make, they're making a moral choice.''

 The country's largest labor federation says the hourly wage in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has fallen to one of the lowest in the world in the past six years. Mexicans who earned the equivalent of $ 1.90 an hour in 1982 now earn 40 cents an hour, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said. The minimum wage, last raised in March, is 8,000 pesos a day, or about $ 3.50. The federation said high payments on the foreign debt were draining the economy. It warned that the loss of buying power generates discontent and could endanger the stability of the country. A government anti-inflation program has brought the increase in consumer prices down from a monthly rate of 15.5 percent in January to 1.7 percent in July. Inflation in 1987 was a record 159.2 percent.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES With London Shares Closing Up Amid Low Volume</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices closed higher Monday, helped by lingering bullish sentiment from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures released last Friday. Price markups by market participants extended a rally begun Friday on the back of the unemployment data, which showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy did not expand in August quite as fast as had been expected. The data allayed concerns that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates still might have to rise further to douse an overheating economy. Analysts said shares were also moving better because, for the time being, fears of rising <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> interest rates have been pushed into the background. However, market watchers were quick to point out that participation remained painfully low Monday. At the end of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 17.6 points, or 1.00 percent, at 1764.5. The index opened 10.2 points higher and bounced as much as 20.4 points higher by mid-morning to its best level of the day. Meanwhile, the narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 14.6 points at 1420.5. Volume was extremely light, with a scant 284.8 million shares changing hands, compared with the 443.8 million shares Friday. Of Monday's total, 192.2 million shares had been traded by midday. Market activity was light in response to a lack of leadership from Wall Street, which was closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. However, several analysts stressed the market's firm undertone after Friday's healthy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures for August and a 52-point bounce upwards on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> August unemployment rate rose to 5.6 percent and non-farm payroll jobs created totaled 219,000. The revised July unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.4 percent but the non-farm payroll gain was revised downward to 200,000 jobs from 283,000 jobs. Market expectations had been for a 5.4-percent unemployment rate and non-farm payrolls at 224,000.

<TEXT>
 The chief negotiator for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> opened talks Monday with government officials on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s request for a stand-by loan of about $ 1.2 billion. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials to discuss, among other topics, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s balance of payments and the anti-inflation plan implemented by President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> early last month. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> funds would be used in part to help <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> pay interest on its $ 56 billion foreign debt. Interest payments on the debt will total about $ 4.6 billion this year alone. Last week, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> reportedly won preliminary approval from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for two loans totaling $ 750 million to reform its banking system and reorient its trade policy, including the lifting of restrictions on imports. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Machinea </PERSON> said early last week he expected an agreement would be concluded by week's end. However, no official statement was issued before the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Husain </PERSON>, returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON> is scheduled to be in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for about a week. Since <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983, government policy has been to finance half the interest payments with Argentine funds and half with borrowed funds. The country's inflation in July exceeded 25 percent. Projections are that inflation will be at least that high for August, though <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and Economy Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> insist the rise in the cost of living for September will be below 10 percent. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodersohn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> were scheduled to fly to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Tuesday to meet with commercial banks to arrange new loans totaling between $ 1.5 billion and $ 3 billion. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign debt is the third highest in the developing world behind that of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. A new <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> agreement would carry through the end of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s term as president, which ends in December 1989. National elections are set for next May.

<TEXT>
 An engineering firm that acted as a consultant to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Public Supply System on abortive plans to build two nuclear power plants has settled with bondholders for $ 20 million, officials said Monday. The settlement between R.W. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> and Associates of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and bondholders was announced in a statement released by court-appointed settlement master <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. It came two days before the scheduled start of a massive securities fraud case against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> in federal court here. The agreement is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, who will preside over the case in which 21 public utilities, two engineering firms and a financial adviser remain as defendants. More than 24,000 bondholders and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, the trustee for bondholders, allege that the supply system fraudulently sold $ 2.25 billion in bonds to build the plants. The project was abandoned in 1982 and the supply system declared default in 1983 after the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled the public utilities involved in the project had no authorization to sign agreements with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>. Monday's announcement brought the total settlements so far to $ 351 million. Agreement has been reached on an additional $ 96 million in claims against insurance companies, although the bondholders must pursue lawsuits to obtain any of that money. Last Wednesday the supply system itself settled with the bondholders for an estimated $ 3 billion, the cost of the bonds plus interest. Bondholders were expected to see little of that settlement money, however, because the supply system has few assets to use to pay back the bonds.

 Five years and more than $ 150 million in legal fees later, a giant fraud case stemming from the biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market is headed for trial Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The litigation in federal court is a consolidation of dozens of lawsuits filed by bondholders after the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s 1983 default on $ 2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance construction of two nuclear power plants. Though it has remained obscure, the so-called `` Whoops'' case has won notoriety in legal and financial circles for its size and complexity. Consider: _ Since about 1980 market defaults have totaled about $ 5.7 billion `` Forty percent of that is <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> 4-5 Bondholders Committee. _ Dozens of attorneys from some 70 law firms, with rates as high as $ 400 an hour, have been involved in pre-trial work Still to be added to the legal tab are trial costs and the fees of many attorneys who have worked for five years on contingency. _ A computerized data-retrieval system for the plaintiffs' side alone has cost more than $ 35 million, and it holds 14 million documents and hundreds of statements by witnesses The defense is keeping its system secret. _ More than 24,000 claims have been filed by an estimated 42,000 bondholders _ Defendants, from Wall Street bond underwriting firms to 88 public utilities to law firms and economic advisers, originally numbered more than 100 Some, including bond underwriters, have settled outside court for $ 331 million so far. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> itself was let out of the suit last week in a surprise move, leaving 21 utilities and engineering and financial adviser firms as defendants. _ The trial itself could last up to two years `` The WPPSS case is unique,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON>, who has written a book on the supply system's woes. `` There is nothing like it. Not only in the dollar amount, but in the complexity of the involvements of different layers of government and governmental authority, the complexity of the number of litigants, claimants, and participants.'' `` All the major brokerage firms were involved, the -LRB- bond -RRB- rating agencies were involved, bond counsel were involved, and different engineering firms, accounting firms, as well as all layers of government,'' he said. Those complexities aside, however, and the case comes down to who will pick up the tab for the WPPSS default and the ensuing legal battle _ bondholders alleging fraud who are stuck with nearly worthless bonds, or electric utility customers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who will have to pay higher rates if a decision goes against them. `` The public is suing the public,'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, commissioner of <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Public </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Utility </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>, a defendant, said in describing the large groups of potential losers. Despite the risk of losing, with the potential of a multibillion-dollar judgment, settlement efforts have fallen short as trial looms. The $ 351 million in settlements so far include $ 92 million from bond underwriters and most of the rest from insurance. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> itself was a relatively minor defendant in the recovery because others named in the action have more resources to tap. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, as part of its settlement, agreed not to contest the future payment of money to reimburse claimants. Left among defendants are only 20 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> utilities, an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> utility, two engineering firms and a financial advisory firm. But those 21 utilities held about a two-thirds interest in the abandoned plants. While settlement was encouraged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, efforts to reach a `` global settlement'' involving all parties fell short last May when defendants declined to counter a plaintiff offer of something in excess of $ 1 billion. Without such a settlement, the case could last for years, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, who retired a year ago as deputy administrator of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a lose-lose proposition every day that litigation goes on,'' he said. `` If the litigation runs its course, it wo n't be resolved until well into the next century.'' For the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, he said, the fighting will continue to have economic costs and take a toll in ill-will and lack of cooperation by various energy and governmental entities. For the bondholders: `` I do n't think any of those living today will see any money. Maybe their heirs will,'' <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON> said. And for attorneys? `` I wish I was still practicing law ... since this is such a marvelous opportunity,'' <PERSON> Ratcliffe </PERSON>, a lawyer, said sardonically. To bondholders, the case is one of giant fraud and conspiracy, coupled with a shameless lack of integrity among defendants, including the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> as a region. They say utilities knowingly entered into faulty agreements with the supply system to build the two plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Nos. 4 and 5. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in June 1983 that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> utilities among the 88 participants contracting to build the plants lacked authority to sign the pacts and did not have to pay. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, trustee for bondholders, accelerated debt payment that August, precipitating the default on the debt. Ratepayer representatives say misguided leadership in the 1970s, faulty projections for energy needs, poor planning and reliance on experts who were simply wrong were among factors that led the region astray. Utility commissioners wrongly believed the plants would be needed to prevent power brown-outs and the public would accept big rate hikes, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, a utility consultant. `` They are not on trial for being stupid,'' he said. `` They are on trial for fraud, and that is different.'' Others said the mishap at the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and a worldwide economic downturn were both critical. Though ratepayers have so far escaped paying for WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5, electric rates have increased five-fold in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to pay for three other <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plants. The rates are assessed through <LOCATION> Bonneville </LOCATION>, a federal power marketing agency, which in effect guaranteed payments for the three plants. That BPA payment-guarantee was not forthcoming for the terminated plants. Trial was moved to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> on a motion that a jury of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> residents might be reluctant to return a decision that could raise their electricity rates.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar finished slightly lower against major currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Monday during trading made light by the close of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> markets for the Labor Day holiday, dealers said. Gold prices finished mixed. Light commercial trading late Monday helped the dollar regain some ground lost earlier in the day in a downward slide that stopped before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency hit 1.8500 West German deutsche marks. `` The market tried again to push the dollar below 1.85 -LRB- marks -RRB- in the morning, but it showed good resistance,'' said a dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Dealers said the currency was helped by the absence of trading in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` It would have been difficult to sell the dollar at 1.85 -LRB- marks -RRB- in today's restricted trading environment,'' one dealer said. Dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Monday morning's decline continued a dollar plunge begun Friday on news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate had risen to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in July. Traders said the market will now adopt a wait-and-see attitude, looking ahead to the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade figures to point a new direction for the dollar. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.72 yen to a closing 136.03. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 135.65 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost 1.6860 dollars to buy one pound, more than 1.6755 dollars late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.8555 West German marks, down from 1.8665; 1.5625 Swiss francs, down from 1.5725; 6.31240 French francs, down from 6.3365; 2.0957 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1050; 1.380.50 Italian lire, down from 1,388.50; and 1.2338 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2362 Gold prices swung in a narrow range in quiet trading, adding to a growing perception that gold could face weaker prices in the near future, dealers said. The lack of a surge in gold prices despite the recent weakness of the dollar has contributed to disinterest in gold, dealers said. Gold settled in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 427.50 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Friday's $ 427.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold was lower, closing at a bid $ 427.50 per ounce compared with $ 428.00 late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.54 to close at a bid $ 429.38. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.50 a troy ounce, compared with Friday's $ 6.52.

 A <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> newsprint manufacturer is planning a joint venture with a Canadian company to build and manage a $ 350 million newsprint plant in northeast <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, officials say. <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, is working on an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi-Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> that should be completed this month. <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Abitibi-Price </ORGANIZATION> each will control 24.25 percent of the plant, and the Venezuelan government will control the rest, said <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` This is a project that the Venezuelan government has been looking at for years,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` By making newsprint there, they can take the wood and power that they have in profusion and are currently not using, and turn it into another export product _ something besides oil _ which they need desperately for foreign exchange in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.'' The new plant will be in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, which is surrounded by acres of <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> pine, and close to <LOCATION> Guri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, one of the world's largest generators of hydroelectric power. Plaza said after the one-machine mill begins operating sometime in 1992, it will produce about 200,000 tons of newsprint per year and employ about 350 people. All but about 40,000 tons of the newsprint will be exported to customers worldwide, <PERSON> Plaza </PERSON> said, and though <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION>'s share will be nominal, it is expected to significantly boost the company's exports, which have fallen off in recent years `` They used to be a fairly good-sized exporter, but more recently they've downsized their export exposure,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Diverio </PERSON>, a pulp and paper analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Bowater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, faced with falling oil export revenue, announced Monday one of its banks will open an office in the gold-mining region of the country to buy gold directly from miners. Finalven plans to open an office in <LOCATION> Guayana </LOCATION>, some 400 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Venpress </ORGANIZATION> announced.

Experts estimate that much of the mined gold is smuggled out of the country in search of better rates. Until recently, there was no centralized system of aquiring the precious metal from the miners, who work independently in the primitive region near the Brazilian border. The Venezuelan <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> opened an office earlier this year that also purchases gold directly from the miners.

<HEAD>Prices Discussed at Cocoa Producer-Consumer Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 37-nation International Cocoa Organization Monday began discussing differences over the support price for cocoa on the first day of crucial talks on the body's future, delegates said. The `` logical consequence of non-agreement'' will be to consider implementing plans to start winding down the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>, said West German chief delegate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>. These plans, officially unveiled Monday, call for halting on Oct. 1 the current levy on internationally traded cocoa _ the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>'s main source of finance _ as well as for the selling off of the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>'s stockpiles to meet running costs during the coming year. Delegates said ending the levy would acknowledge that the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> had no further role to play in supporting prices. Already the body lacks enough money to implement a possible new stockpiling scheme because some producers are behind in payments to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>, delegates said. The <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> is owed a total of $ 70 million, they said. Prices on world markets last week reached their lowest levels in seven years, reflecting a current world cocoa glut and an absence of <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> support operations since February, when intervention buying was indefinitely suspended. The proposed new stockpiling scheme, under which producers would receive <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> financing to hold back up to 120,000 metric tons of cocoa from the market, has been blocked by lack of funds and the dispute between producers and consumers over the support price for cocoa. Consumers say under the provisions of the price pact administered by the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> a cut in the price was automatically triggered in March, but this interpretation is rejected by the producers. A special panel set up to resolve the dispute reported to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> today that it was split 3 to 2 on the issue. Its independent Belgian chairman, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Parotte </PERSON>, backed the view of the panel's two consumer members while two producer representatives backed their side's view, delegates said. It is now up to the full <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> to decide the matter and delegates said the continued polarization of views made a solution appear very difficult to attain. <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> said even if agreement were possible, consumers would then press for a further cut in the support price to reflect recent developments on the market. Even then the new stockpiling scheme could not operate without payment of producer debts to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION>, consumer delegates said. `` The withholding scheme is linked to the arrears,'' said <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the French drinks company, said Monday it made a friendly takeover offer of 285 million Irish punts, the equivalent of $ 412 million, for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to counter a hostile bid by the British liquor group <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. Pernod claims to have received assurances from 51.8 percent of the Irish whiskey maker's shareholders to sell their shares to <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Heneghan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> confirmed it had made a 450 pence -LRB- $ 6.50 -RRB- a share bid, but declined to comment further before making its official announcement. Trading in shares of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> was suspended Monday, at the company's request, before the official opening of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> Shares were suspended at 366 British pence -LRB- $ 6.17 -RRB- each, equal to their Friday closing price. The suspension followed <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Sunday that it had raised its takeover bid to 332 million Irish punts -LRB- $ 480 million -RRB- from 253 million punts -LRB- $ 366 million -RRB- in anticipation of <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION>'s offer. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> also said Monday it would challenge the decision of a British board which regulates mergers and acquisitions to allow Grand Metropolitan to raise its bid. The French company will appeal the decision before <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s independent <ORGANIZATION> Takeover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION>, whose executive board allowed the raised bid on Sunday, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beevor </PERSON>, director general of the panel and a member of its executive board In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, Irish Commerce Minister <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said the takeover situation would also be examined by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in terms of its impact on employment, competition and `` the common good.'' The Dublin-based <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was holding talks with <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION>, which has boosted its holding to five percent of the company's shares from 2.8 percent. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> has said it would allow <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> to operate as an independent component of the <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> group, maintaining the `` integrity of the Irish whiskey industry.'' The Grand Met bid is worth 525 Irish pence -LRB- $ 7.58 -RRB- a share, up from 400 pence -LRB- $ 5.78 -RRB-. Grand Met said Monday it now owns an 8.19-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>, the largest maker of Irish whiskey. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' spokesman said <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> has made an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> FII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fyffes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for the 20.04 percent of the shares it owns. Pernod obtained an interim injunction in the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Sunday preventing <ORGANIZATION> Fyffes </ORGANIZATION>, an Irish fruit importer, from selling its shares eleswhere before Wednesday.

 If you do n't know what `` couch potato,'' `` fat city'' and `` junk bond'' mean, you can now look them up in the first new College Edition of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s New World Dictionary of the American Language in 18 years. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s New World Dictionary is one of the nation's best-selling reference books and the dictionary of choice of many of the nation's largest news-gathering organizations The Third College Edition goes on sale Tuesday at $ 17.95 for hard cover. `` It is an absolutely excellent dictionary,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kister </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a librarian and the author of Dictionary Buying Guide. `` Among all the good desk dictionaries, it is probably the best in the coverage of Americanisms _ that is, words that originated in this country.'' The dictionary defines a couch potato as `` a chronic television viewer.'' Fat city is `` a place or condition of prosperity, comfort, success, etc.'' And a junk bond is `` a high-yield speculative bond often issued to finance the takeover of a corporation.'' Those are some of the new terms among 11,000 American words and phrases and more than 170,000 entries in the dictionary. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dictionaries </ORGANIZATION>, which has 16 employees in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Editor in chief <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Neufeldt </PERSON>, who joined the company 4 -LCB- years ago, said planning for the Third College Edition began in the mid'70s, and the staff began producing it in 1979. The company's two full-time and one part-time readers continuously read books, newspapers, magazines and signs in search of new words or new ways of using words. References to new words are clipped and placed on index cards with enough of the surrounding text for editors to be able to determine how the words were used. Editors refer to the cards when trying to decide whether a term is common enough to be included in the dictionary. Words that are no longer used are deleted. `` There's so little you can really delete,'' Ms. <PERSON> Neufeldt </PERSON> said. `` There is just so much burgeoning of the vocabulary. And you have to keep some of the old words'' because they are in books that remain popular, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Neufeldt </PERSON> said the Second College Edition was updated every two years, but some changes could n't be made because it would have involved altering too many pages. She said, for example, the third edition uses the word `` Muslim'' instead of `` Moslem'' to describe a follower of Islam. That change could n't be made in the second edition updates because references to `` Moslem'' throughout the dictionary would have had to be altered, she said. The third edition is the first produced by the company using a computer database, Ms. <PERSON> Neufeldt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kister </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s New World is one of two companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that can trace its heritage to <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, who wrote dictionaries around the year 1800. The other is <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which published the latest edition of its Collegiate Dictionary in 1983. Although sales figures are not available, <PERSON> Kister </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s Collegiate Dictionary is the nation's best selling dictionary. As many as 12 million dictionaries are sold each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Merriam </PERSON> and New World both have sold millions of copies. New World is used by The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Other popular dictionaries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>.
