<HEAD>Large Dam Killing Off Chinese Sturgeons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Chinese sturgeon, a 10-foot ocean fish, is in danger of extinction because a <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dam is blocking it from the breeding grounds it has used for 300 million years, an official newspaper reported today. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said the number of mature Chinese sturgeons, known scientifically as <PERSON> Acipenser </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinensis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, has fallen to 5,000 and at least 400 are being killed each year. There are even fewer of the smaller white sturgeon, it said. The fish, which weigh between 330 and 550 pounds when they lay eggs, are unable to reach their breeding grounds in the upper reaches of the Yangtze because of the newly completed <ORGANIZATION> Gezhouba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dam </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> province. The dam, under construction since 1974 and partially operating since 1981, prevents the fish from reaching 19 of their 20 breeding grounds 1,800 miles upstream in the <LOCATION> Jinsha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> tributary. The dam builders originally agreed to put in a passageway for the fish around the dam, but abandoned the idea because of the expense. Every year, about 30 dead sturgeons are found at the base of the dam. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Yangtze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, as saying female sturgeons reach maturity at age 13 or 14, when they begin their 20-month journey into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest river. Because the fish eat nothing while they are in the river, they are exhausted by the trip and are not ready to breed again for four or five years. An average sturgeon, he said, lays about 18 pounds of eggs, or about 450,000 fry. But 80 percent are eaten by other fish and most of the young sturgeon do not survive their six-month journey to the sea. <PERSON> Ke </PERSON> said about 370 sturgeon a year are caught at the mouth of the river by fishermen unaware the fish is now under state protection. Ke's institute, which has a budget of only $ 6,750 a year for sturgeon research, is now trying artificial breeding to save the fish from extinction. It has been putting about 350,000 sturgeon fry into the river a year. The dam, with a designed capacity of 2.7 million kilowatts, will supply 20 percent of the central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> network's electricity when it is fully operating.

<TEXT>
 Carnaby Street, which soared to fame as the fashion pacesetter for Beatles generation of the Swinging Sixties, is seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the 1980s. When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quant </PERSON>'s miniskirts and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>'s bell-bottom hip-huggers clothed the flower children, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> became the fashion capital of the world and Carnaby Street the favorite haunt of the Mods and Rockers. For about a decade, young people from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> flocked to boutiques called <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cat </PERSON>, Take 6, and Lord <PERSON> John </PERSON> to buy the latest in hot pants, platform shoes, wide floral ties and psychedelic shirts. But as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and other designers moved out and Carnaby Street took on a tacky down-market flavor. The street remains a microcosm of English fashion over the last 20 years: Shoppers can buy the'60s Mod look,'70s hippie and ethnic fashions and'80s punk leather and sado-masochistic gear including studded leather belts, Sex Pistols T-shirts and neo-fascist and Nazi-symbol buttons. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Peachey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the private real estate company that owns about three-quarters of <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, wants to restore some fashion magnetism to the two-block thoroughfare tucked behind <ORGANIZATION> Regent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> in the heart of central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We're not trying to revive the'60s,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON>'s surveyor for Carnaby Street. `` What we are aiming to do in <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> is cater to the better-off young market, the 15-30 age group who, like the young kids in the'60s, had no shops catering to them, especially in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' Over the last two years, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> has replaced about half of the shops that sold this fashion mish-mash with branches of pricier, fashion chains like <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>, Supreme, <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>, Confetti and Midas. The Nazi-insignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment that the two main stores, on an alley off <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, are being forced out of business under pressure from <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON>, Westminster borough authorities and anti-fascist campaigners. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Quant </PERSON>, who worked out of the King's <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> in the 1960s, has opened her first shop on Carnaby Street, selling makeup and accessories. She said she was lured by the revival of the surrounding <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> area as a center for young people and young industries. <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON> hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with wine bars, restaurants and art galleries. `` It does take a long time to move a whole area around,'' he said in an interview. `` Not only do we have to change tenents, but we have to tell the world this area has changed.'' Last June, <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> relaunched Carnaby Street with balloons, 20,000 leaflets and the message that it was now `` synonymous with chic and stylish <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' This year, it hopes to start regular street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows. Knitwear designer <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Foale </PERSON>, who moved into <LOCATION> Carnaby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in the early 1960s and did clothes for the Beatles, remembers when it was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended. `` Now, it's beginning to come up again,'' she said. `` But it's always different ... The next Carnaby Street will have its own incarnation.'' But many shoppers, designers and storekeepers mourn the Carnaby Street they say is gone forever. `` It's an interesting historic relic. It's where it all started,'' said Los Angeles-born Giffi Fields, who started selling hand-painted, made-to-measure men's clothes to Carnaby Street shops in the late 1960s. `` Carnaby Street was a one-off -LRB- one-of-a-kind area -RRB- at its time because it was a street devoted to youth culture,'' he said. `` Every major city in the world today does n't have only one street, but many streets devoted to youth culture. So you just do n't get the uniqueness anymore and you wo n't get the uniqueness.'' At <LOCATION> Inderwick </LOCATION>'s pipe shop, a Carnaby Street landmark for at least 70 years and the only store left from the 1960s, owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> doubted <PERSON> Peachey </PERSON> would succeed because the street is getting the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Most shops are multiple or franchises. Not one shop has individual character except The Great Frog, because they make their own jewelry,'' said the 64-year-old businessman. `` I ca n't see it ever becoming what they're aiming for. It's still a street without any character. Shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with Carnaby Street's current clientele. Those at the top said the street was still attracting the same customers it did in 1975 _ young people looking for cheap clothes. But those at the bottom complained that the punks, Mods, skinheads and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight people in suits. Potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also unimpressed. `` It's just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either side,'' complained <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawkins </PERSON>, 30, a student and motorcycle courier. `` It's just a tourist trap. Most people from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> would n't come here.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, 20, a student from <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, said: `` It's gone downhill. It's too respectable now. The businessmen have taken over. It tries to be anarchic and anti-establishment, but it does it all commercially so it's not unique.''

<TEXT>
 At least 100 people, most of them poor laborers, died and more than 200 others were battling for their lives after drinking homemade liquor in the western city of <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION>, news reports said Monday. Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and said at least 100 of the 251 people hospitalized after drinking the illicit brew Saturday were in critical condition. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said survival chances were bleak for virtually all the patients. Both news agencies said the death toll was at least 100 and was expected to rise. The mass poisoning in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>, the only Indian state where sale of alcohol is banned, was the country's worst known liquor poisoning case, the news agencies said. Many victims are likely to go blind if they live, doctors treating the patients said, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. Press Trust quoted doctors as saying some of the victims could have been saved if they had sought treatment earlier. It said many victims became dizzy and fell into stupors after drinking the illegal brew in the city 560 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said police arrested three people who had supplied the liquor. A son of one supplier and the son of a prominent local politician were among those killed by the poisonous brew, it said. <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>'s chief minister, <PERSON> Amarsinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhary </PERSON>, ordered an investigation and promised `` drastic action'' against the police officials who failed to avert the tragedy, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper said most of the victims were poor laborers who bought the liquor Saturday morning after receiving their monthly wages. The first deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it added. As news of the first deaths emerged, police fanned out across <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION> with loudspeakers blaring warnings that anyone who had consumed the liquor should seek medical help immediately. The liquor, known locally as `` lattha,'' is made from industrial spirits and methyl alcohol. About 300 people have died in about seven illicit liquor tragedies in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> during the last decade, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Two of the previous cases occurred in <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION>, with others reported in <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Surat </LOCATION>.

 No one in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> outside of the Moslem community has endorsed the Iranian death sentence against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, but some are supporting the author of `` The Satanic Verses'' through gritted teeth. `` An insidious outbreak of ` yes-but' has entered the public debate on the rights and rightness of his case,'' the Observer newspaper said in an editorial Sunday. The debate even popped up at a Writers' Day conference organized by British Pen, the association of poets, essayist and novelists. Most wrote supportive greetings to <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> in a book that was left open for messages, but one entry said: `` Personal freedom is constrained by personal responsibility. You are shown to be wanting in the latter.'' Below it, another writer asserted: `` Freedom is freedom. It does not imply restraint.'' The liberal Observer said it was disturbed by statements by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> last week that the book was offensive, and by the opinion of Lord <PERSON> Jakobovits </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chief rabbi, that such books should be banned. They are not alone in their criticisms. `` Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s life has to be defended at all costs, but not necessarily his book,'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative newspaper, said in an editorial last week. A cartoon in The Sunday Express showed <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> dressed like <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, with a flowing beard of pound notes labeled `` my royalties,'' and threatening the foreign secretary. `` Blasphemy, Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON>,'' the caption said. `` I shall call upon the authors of the world to spear you with their pens.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sentenced him to death. Iranian clergymen have offered a bounty of as much as $ 5.2 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> still insists <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> repudiate the death sentence before diplomatic relations can be normalized. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has withdrawn its diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Majlis, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s legislature, has set Tuesday as a deadline for breaking diplomatic relations unless <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> `` clarifies'' its position on the book. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency said Sunday that `` the withdrawal of all copies of ` The Satanic Verses' and banning of its reprinting by the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government would certainly bring <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> closer to the implementation of the Iranian conditions.'' Many of those in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> who criticize the book stop short of calling for it to be banned. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawcross </PERSON>, a prominent attorney and a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> had committed `` a deplorable abuse of the freedom which he shares with the rest of us, but which we must nonetheless defend.'' `` The <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> book has done incalculable harm to the interests of all people, not with any intention of contribution to scholarship but in order to sensationalize a novel in the hope of securing its better sale,'' <PERSON> Shawcross </PERSON> wrote. In its editorial, The Telegraph said that `` free speech to some degree depends on responsibility in exercising it.'' `` A civilized society is unwise to insist that all abuses of freedom of expression within the law, regardless of the damage done, form part of the ark of the covenant and so are sacrosanct,'' the newspaper said. <PERSON> Auberon </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>, fuming over <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s past criticisms of British imperialism and racial prejudice, wrote in The Spectator magazine: `` Perhaps the real debate is not so much whether <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should be executed ... but just how much we should exert ourselves, as deeply stained white imperialists, to protect him from his own people.'' `` I really do not think it unreasonable in the circumstance of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s having made several million pounds through insulting <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, to suggest that he should pay for any police protection he may judge advisable,'' said <PERSON> Waugh </PERSON>, a columnist for The Spectator and The Sunday Telegraph. A letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> from <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Treglown </PERSON>, editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supplement </ORGANIZATION>, argued that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s critics might want a broader revision of the literary canon. `` <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>'s pamphlets and <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>'s and Pope's satires, which caused deep and violent feeling in those they attacked, should obviously have been toned down. Many readers have been made uncomfortable by the moral insights of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Austen </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dickens </LOCATION> _ clear cases for sensitive editing,'' <PERSON> Treglown </PERSON> wrote. `` Would n't we be easier in our minds if there were no books at all?''

 Alphabetically speaking, <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was used to being last on lists. But catching the caboose in Rand McNally's `` Places Rated Almanac'' four years ago insulted residents right down to their toes. At first, they fumed, they raged, they stamped their collective civic feet. Then they got smart. City leaders decided `` there are only two places to be on the list: the top _ and the bottom,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yuba-Sutter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. `` It depends what you make of both of them.'' What <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citians </LOCATION> made from last place was a heap of first-rate public relations hay. In the 50 years since one <PERSON> E.L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorndike </PERSON> created his `` goodness index'' for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities, academicians, special interest groups, magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of rankings identifying the best of all possible towns. Stressed out? Live in <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, says one survey; <ORGANIZATION> Cedar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapids </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, says another. Best place for a hip, contemporary career woman? <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, Savvy magazine says. Easiest place to make friends? <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> says. No. 1 overall? It's <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, says one survey; <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, says another. In a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants to be one, where everyone says it does n't matter what other people think but no one believes it, city ratings have become a source of indignation, elation, frustration and, always, fascination. Now, it's almost time for another edition of `` Places Rated,'' the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch. Like the presidential election, it appears every four years _ and a lot of people do n't like the results. The fallout has included threatened lawsuits, map and magazine burnings and, on a number of occasions, campaigns for civic improvements. But ask researchers, city officials and municipal groups what city rankings mean, and how seriously to take them, and the answers seem to be not much, and not very. `` There's no best city, just like there's no best work of art,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, computer researcher who, despite that opinion, created software that rates cities. `` Who's to say <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s ` Sunflower' is better than -LRB- da <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>'s -RRB- ` The Last Supper'?'' And who's to say there are 328 better places to live than <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>? Why, `` Places Rated'' authors <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, that's who. When <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> leaders reflected on how to make the best out of being the worst, they decided to lighten up. `` If you screamed and ranted and raved, you made a fool of yourself,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> said. `` We decided to make a fun thing of it.'' First, 1,000 residents burned hundreds of Rand McNally maps at a community pep rally, packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a local mortician present them to a Rand <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> vice president, who flew out from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> just for the occasion. Then the city helped a radio station in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> _ rated No. 1 in the same survey _ award an all-expense paid trip to <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> as a contest prize. The happy winners toured the city by limousine and rode a float in the 105th Annual Bok-Kai Festival. A good time was had by all. And at year's end, when <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> wrapped up 1985, it was <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, that received a full page. `` And they spelled the name right,'' <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> mused, a little amazed. It took `` Places Rated'' to not only rocket <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> out of obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the best-seller list. The idea sprang from the authors' desire to move out of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and their discovery that there was no single source for good, solid data on life in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. They decided to compile a comprehensive American cities reference guide, and sold Rand <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> on the idea in 1978. The first edition, with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at the top and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in the cellar, came out in 1981. More than 300,000 book sales later, <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> says he's a bit disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended, and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him. `` I would n't go out and buy a book that said <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was the best place in the country,'' he said, taking a rare break from his computer and the latest edition of `` Places Rated,'' due out this fall from <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired the series last year from Rand McNally. When the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability on <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, a city once known as `` hell with the lid off,'' even <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> did n't believe it at first. The crowning of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> illustrates the key difference between `` Places Rated'' and other city rankings. The Savageau-Boyer study gives equal weight to climate, housing, crime, transportation, health care, recreation, education, the arts and economics. That might tend to give an edge to larger cities, which have more amenities, and does n't take into account which factors people think are most important. Other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life, such relief from stress _ which the advocacy group Zero Population Growth found in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION> and a study in Psychology Today magazine found in State College. Or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people, as Money magazine does, polling 251 subscribers. In its 1987 survey, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> was 43rd; <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, was No. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> moved to No. 20; <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was top of the heap. A change from one year to the next in what the subscribers consider most important _ say, education over leisure, or transportation over weather _ plus even a small shift in a city's vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation, said <PERSON> Sperling </PERSON>, whose company, <ORGANIZATION> Fast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forward </ORGANIZATION>, has created a computer program called `` Places U.S.A.'' used by Money `` Some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have used it to say, ` Oh, yeah?,' and show they have a strong community support base,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>, spokesman for the National League of Cities. `` It depends on the resourcefulness of the city.'' The league would n't dream of ranking its 1,400 members. `` I do n't know who these surveys benefit, except the authors Everybody does n't live in the perfect place, but it's home to us,'' <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> said. `` Whether you live in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>, life is what you make of it.'' The same can be said of city ratings. In the next `` Places Rated,'' <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> plan a section designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain conditions, using factors in the book, any burg can be a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` For instance, if the only thing you're interested in are cities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with a moderate climate and low cost of living,'' <PERSON> Savageau </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would be the best place in the whole country.''

<TEXT>
 Outrage over a schoolyard massacre led five <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities to ban semiautomatic rifles, but legislative attacks on so-called assault weapons elsewhere in the nation are facing stiff opposition from gun advocates. Bills to ban or restrict military-style assault rifles have surfaced or are planned for introduction in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 11 states and at least a dozen cities following the Jan. 17 shooting spree at an elementary school in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Five children died, and 29 others and a teacher were injured, when drifter <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle on a crowded playground He fired 106 bullets in two minutes, and then killed himself. The shock and anger that erupted, combined with concerns over the mounting use of assault weapons by drug gangs, prompted bans in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Compton </LOCATION>. Outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has banned the weapons. But elsewhere, the outrage seems to be losing some of its persuasive power. Bills to ban or restrict assault weapons have died in the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> legislatures; in <LOCATION> Hutchinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, city commissioners rejected a ban on assault rifles after facing an angry crowd of 150, only one of whom spoke in favor of the ban. The issue has revived familiar gun-control arguments. One side says the bloodshed must stop, while the other says <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> have a constitutional right to own guns. `` We think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is tired of picking up the newspaper or watching TV and seeing kids and police officers lying in pools of blood,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scutt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We share the grief of the tragedy in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` But the answer does not lie in restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens. The answer lies in getting the criminal off the street.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has challenged the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities' bans in court, arguing that only the Legislature has the power to regulate firearms in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The biggest legislative battles are still to come. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering four bills to ban or restrict assault weapons. Bills are pending or expected to be introduced in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Debate on all the bills focuses on how to define assault rifles. An automatic weapon, or machine gun, fires bullets as long as the trigger is pulled. A federal permit is needed to own one. Semiautomatic rifles, which can be bought over the counter in nearly all states, fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger but do not need to be cocked or loaded between pulls. Most states allow such rifles in hunting but usually limit the size of the ammunition magazine, or clip. Distinguishing assault rifles such as the Soviet-designed AK-47 from semiautomatic hunting rifles can be difficult. `` They all function the same way,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. `` All that changes is you take off the wood stock and put on a plastic or metal folding stock, or you put on a banana clip, rather than a small hunting clip, or you put on a bayonet.'' Some legislation would ban specific brands of guns, but the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> argues that is useless. `` The AK-47 this year will be the AR-48 next year, and they'd be out from under the regulation,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. While the debate bogs down in detail, the issue remains clear to <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Geng </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> teacher whose leg has a hole `` the size of a grapefruit'' from <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s shooting spree. `` These people against a ban _ I'd like to have had them standing out there next to me,'' she said. `` I do n't believe there is any reason for that type of weapon to exist in our society.'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said imports of AK-47s, which at $ 250 to $ 350 are among the cheapest assault rifles, have increased tenfold in the past four years. More than 40,000 were imported during the 14 months ending Nov. 30, he said. If anything, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said, debate over banning assault rifles has boosted sales. Demand is reported especially high in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. And when a store in <LOCATION> Menomonee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, ran a `` get'em - before-you-ca n't'' sale on AK-47s, it sold out and had to order 150 In <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, meanwhile, police are relying on the honesty of gun owners to turn in their now illegal semiautomatic rifles. They've received seven

 Islam may surpass <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's largest minority religion by the turn of the century, but American Moslems still are struggling to find their place in a nation that has long defined itself as `` Protestant, Catholic, Jewish.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publication of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses'' _ a novel some consider blasphemous _ is to many of the nation's estimated 3.5 million Moslems only the latest example of how acceptable anti-Moslem prejudice has become in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` The eight years they lived under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were not easy years. The enemy moved from being the ` evil empire' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>, a professor of Islamic history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>. `` I've seen the prejudice. It's almost American to bash Islam.'' Nor has their exclusion from the American religious landscape ended with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure, according to Moslem leaders. There were neither Moslem participants nor any mention of Islam at an interfaith <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration `` We felt a bit insulted but blamed it on their ignorance rather than discourtesies,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON>, a co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Islamic Affairs. The service was organized by a National Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving committee. Ever since interfaith support was drummed up for World War I, with <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders showing unprecedented cooperation, the portrait of the nation as consisting of three basic faiths has been implanted in the public mind. Moslems have settled in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since the 19th century, but tremendous growth did not take place until the 1960s and 1970s when relaxed immigration rules and a jump in Islamic students related to the oil boom coincided with a movement by blacks to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. No one knows how many Moslems there are in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> _ estimates range from 2 million to 10 million _ but many scholars and religious leaders say <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>'s estimate of between 3 million and 4 million is the most reliable. If that estimate is correct, there are more Moslems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than two of the nation's most influential denominations, the 3 million-member Presbyterian Church -LRB- U.S.A. -RRB- and the 2.5 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Because of higher rates of immigration, births and conversions among Moslems, there also is substantial agreement with <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON>'s assessment that if current demographic trends continue the nation's Moslem population will be larger than the Jewish population `` possibly by 2000, definitely by 2015 The nation's Jewish population is estimated at 5.9 million. But growing numbers have not meant growing respect for Moslems, who still must contend with public perceptions of them ranging from `` camel jockeys'' to more dangerous stereotypes fostered by American anger over <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` The amazing thing about it is that they persist so perversely,'' said <PERSON> Marston </PERSON> <PERSON> Speight </PERSON>, director of the Office of Christian-Moslem Relations for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everywhere I go, no matter what I say, people always come up with the stereotype of Islam being a fanatically aggressive type of religion.'' <PERSON> Speight </PERSON> said the ethical principles of peace and mercy in the Koran, the sacred book of Moslems, `` simply belie the negative, militant, violent image.'' He said violent acts committed in the name of <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> have parallels in Christian history, but `` morally and ethically, Islam and Christianity and Judaism are on common ground.'' Many religious groups have made improved relations with Moslems a priority. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrelli </PERSON>, executive secretary of the Office for Interreligious Relations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said Catholic-Moslem dialogue is going on in cities such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and he expects more meetings and discussions nationally. Rabbi <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the `` the test of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> religion in the 21st century'' will be its ability to integrate other religious groups such as Moslems. `` If we fail, if we can not have a mutually respectful society, then we can end up with religious, sectarian strife, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> forbid,'' he said, adding that his organization has increased efforts to have contacts with Moslems. <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> said that with the exception of unofficial, isolated letters from Christian fundamentalists who label Moslems `` heathens,'' the `` overwhelming number of established religions have been supportive.'' But discrimination persists, he and others contend. <PERSON> Haddad </PERSON> said since 1985, mosques have been bombed in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and others have been desecrated. The publication of `` The Satanic Verses'' `` showed Moslems are not perceived as being part and parcel of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, and are misunderstood,'' said <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Babgy </PERSON>, education director for the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has said the book is a work of fiction that was not intended to offend anyone. Viking Penguin, the book's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publisher, has said its position is `` freedom of speech, freedom to publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed internationally.'' But the turmoil caused by the book may have long-term benefits for American Moslems, according to officials here. `` The atmosphere has changed remarkably in recent times. This whole issue of ` Satanic Verses' is pushing us together more,'' <PERSON> Babgy </PERSON> said. `` I think there is a clear and dramatic unification of Moslems in this country.'' Since the controversy developed, <PERSON> Mehdi </PERSON> said, his office has received about 20 calls from people who used obscene language to express their point of view, and four times as many calls from people wanting to find out more about Islam.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are concerned that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, already a principal opium producer, could become an even greater source of illicit narcotics in the wake of the Soviet troop withdrawal. `` <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> ... worries everyone who is interested in this issue,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for narcotics affairs. Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, in discussing the department's annual narcotics control report, said the problem is likely to be aggravated when the estimated 3 million to 5 million Afghan refugees return to their homeland. In the wake of the destruction caused by the nine-year war against the Soviet occupiers, traditional agriculture has been made nearly impossible in many regions. `` As we see refugees moving back into a war-torn country where there is no strong central government, we see them returning to a fairly easy, quick, profitable means of supporting themselves,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. `` Therefore, the prediction is that output of opium will increase out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which then leads to a chain reaction of increased heroin moving through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' she added. Throughout the opium-producing region that also includes <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, `` prospects are not good'' for any reduction in the opium trade in the coming year, Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. With some 700-800 metric tons produced last year, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is second only to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in opium production in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the report said. `` Compounding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government frustration at increasing worldwide opium supplies is the fact that about 90 percent of the world's opium production takes place in areas in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has little or no access _ such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' the report said The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> long warned the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels against producing and smuggling drugs to support their war effort against the Soviets. With the Soviets gone, the rebels are now attempting to overthrow the communist regime of strongman <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are concerned that amid a possible struggle among the various rebel factions, narcotics control might not be given a high priority. `` Current agricultural production is roughly half of the prewar level, insufficient to support the existing population, let along the large numbers of returning refugees,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a senior policy analyst at the conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Drug production could be a major problem,'' he said in an interview. `` But perhaps I'm just more pessimistic than others.'' Another State Department Afghan expert, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must wait for a central government to be formed to start any kind of comprehensive drug eradication or crop substitution program. But he took a more positive approach to the post-Soviet era. The <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has been involved in a pilot program near the city of <LOCATION> Jalabad </LOCATION>, encouraging farmers to switch from poppy growing to wheat and vegetable production, he said. `` We're pleased with it,'' he said, claiming a `` quite impressive'' success with the local farmers and expressing hopes the pilot program could be used elsewhere once calm is restored. At present, however, cooperation can only be obtained in certain areas where rebel leaders are in control and sympathetic to such an approach, the official said. `` My sense is, the resistance leaders we work with are exceptionally sensitive to this, aware that it is a domestic issue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' added the official. He predicted that fundamentalist rebel leaders intend `` to apply the rigid tenets of Islam'' and police drug production if they gain control.

<HEAD>Nearly Half of Police Forces Have Fewer than 10 Officers</HEAD>

 Law enforcement is a lonesome job in nearly a thousand <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> communities with one-officer police departments, according to a government study. Although some big cities and counties boast thousands of officers, nearly half of all police and sheriff's departments have fewer than 10 officers, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> reported on Sunday. Law enforcement agencies ranged in size from 34 police departments and 12 sheriff's offices with more than 1,000 officers apiece to the 987 departments with just one, according to the study, the first detailed statistical analysis of local law enforcement staffing. All state police agencies, 99 percent of sheriff's offices and 97 percent of local police agencies with 135 or more officers require at least a high school diploma, the 1987 study found. A separate analysis of police standards in 1967 found only 70 percent required such a diploma. In fact, the new study found, about 10 percent of the larger police departments and 6 percent of sheriff's operations are now requiring prospective officers to have at least some college education. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said that overall the nation has 11,989 local police departments, 3,080 sheriff's departments and 49 state police agencies. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has no state police, even though such a department was once featured in the television show `` <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Five-0.'' Nationally, law enforcement agencies had 757,508 employees including 555,364 sworn officers. Of those agencies 52.6 percent of local police departments have fewer than 10 officers and 79 percent have under 25, the report found. Among sheriff's offices, 33.6 percent had under 10 deputies and 67.3 percent had fewer than 25. Thus, of the 15,057 local police and sheriff's agencies, 48.7 percent had fewer than 10 officers. Sheriff's departments led the way in employing women, at 12.5 percent of their sworn deputies, the report found. Women constituted 7.6 percent of local police officers and only 4.2 percent of state troopers. Blacks were more strongly represented on local police departments, making up 9.3 percent of the officers. Sheriff's offices reported 8.3 percent black deputies and state police lagged with 6.5 percent Average annual starting salaries for police officers ranged from $ 13,768 in the smallest departments to $ 23,000 in cities of a million people or more. Local police chiefs were paid salaries of between $ 18,503 and $ 87,044. Salaries and wages accounted for six of every seven dollars spent on police work by governments. Total police spending was $ 28.3 billion. Two-thirds of the departments that have 135 or more officers said they allow collective bargaining. Nationwide, 31.7 percent of police agencies and 28.3 percent of sheriff's departments said they participated in the 911 emergency telephone system. The highest rate was 88 percent for police in cities of between 250,000 and 500,000 people. Sheriff's offices serving communities of under 10,000 reported that only 15.7 percent had the 911 system in use. The responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies vary from place to place in addition to regular peacekeeping functions. Nearly half of the departments are also responsible for animal control in their communities, for example, and one in four handles emergency medical services. Other special functions include court security, handled by 22 percent of the departments; civil defense, 21 percent; civil process serving, 18 percent; jail operation, 12 percent; training academy, 6 percent; drug testing, 4 percent; and ballistics testing, 2 percent.

 The burgeoning homicide toll in the nation's capital is providing doctors with a new source of organs for transplant `` There's always going to be tragedy and there are going to be fatalities with young people,'' says Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>, medical director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Regional Transplant Consortium. `` And the one and only clear-cut benefit to society of that, which did n't exist until recently, is the fact that other lives can be saved as the result of these people that lose their lives prematurely.'' The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> George </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, each had record homicide rates in 1988. In the district alone, more than 90 people have been killed thus far this year. That is far above the 1988 rate. In the district and Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, many of the homicides are attributed to drugs. The record homicide rates are `` absolutely'' increasing the number of available organs and tissue for transplant, said <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>, who performs heart transplants at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the city's largest and most active trauma facility. `` I would say that probably about twice the number of donors are being procured this year as were being procured last year,'' he said. Last August, the consortium received 14 referrals for organ donations. Six months later, the number had risen to 27. In addition to the record homicide rates, the availability of organs for transplants also has been assisted by a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> law passed in January 1988 requiring that families be asked to donate organs. Victims felled by a single gunshot wound to the head are the most likely candidates for donation because their organs are n't damaged, said <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>. When they can, doctors keep gunshot victims alive on a ventilator. But if it's certain the person is brain-dead, hospital and consortium officials ask the bereaved family to donate the victim's organs. `` I'd say the families of drug victims are very supportive as a rule,'' he said. `` They want to donate the organs.'' `` It's solace,'' concurred <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardi </PERSON>, a consortium executive committee member and assistant administrator at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's the way they deal with their grief, to know the individual is alive in someone else, to know they've touched someone else. When dealing with homicide victims, hospital staff also must cooperate with homicide detectives and the medical examiner, and these delays sometimes make it impossible to perform transplants, said <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>. Tests are run to ensure that the potential donor meets rigid criteria. If there are signs of intravenous drug use or a history of promiscuous homosexuality, transplants are ruled out because of the AIDS risk to potential recipients, doctors said. When doctors are finished removing organs and tissue, the respirator which has kept the victim alive is quietly turned off. As many as 16 people can benefit from a single person's death, receiving the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and assorted tissue such as bones, eyes and skin, said <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>. Recipients for the various organs are chosen from waiting lists and summoned to the hospital within eight hours. About 20 people in this region are waiting for new hearts and are likely to die in less than a year without transplants, said <PERSON> Macoviak </PERSON>. Ninety percent of organs procured in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area are used for people on waiting lists here. Only those organs for which there's no local match are sent elsewhere. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Regional Transplant Consortium was created by six area hospitals in 1986 to pool resources for heart transplantation. It coordinates organ procurement in the metropolitan area and last year was authorized to perform liver transplants. `` It's unfortunate that someone has to die to save another life, but that's the way it is,'' said <PERSON> Bardi </PERSON>. `` It's a cycle.''

 A group has threatened to blow up a monument to <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Alighieri </PERSON> because the medieval poet's famed `` Divine Comedy'' places the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in hell, officials said Sunday. Mayor <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragone </PERSON> said he ordered increased security around the monument to the poet, who died in <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION> in 1321, after receiving a threatening letter from a group calling itself `` Guardians of the Revolution.'' `` It is an initiative taken in a prudent way because I am more inclined to think that the letter, which also was sent to a local newspaper, is a joke orchestrated in bad taste or a provocation,'' <PERSON> Dragone </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION>. However, the mayor said he warned police and demanded stepped up security because he believes the potential danger from such threats should not be underestimated. He said the letter also demanded that he repudiate `` the false poet <PERSON> Dante </PERSON>'' and declare publicly `` that <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> lied and that these verses can no longer be read or studied.'' The `` Divine Comedy'' is considered a literary masterpiece that established the Tuscan dialect as the literary language of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The work, a poem of more than 14,000 lines in 100 cantos, recounts a poet's journey through hell, purgatory and heaven. It places <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> in the ninth pit of hell. It comes in the midst of the controversy over `` The Satanic Verses'' by author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a native Indian now living in Briton. Iranian clerics have offered a $ 5.2 million reward for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death because they say the book blasphemes <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> by portraying <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, not God, was the source for the Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book.

<TEXT>
 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are voicing concern over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's delay in naming an official to head a newly reorganized drive to assist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry with high-technology innovation. In addition to the absence of a permanent appointee to the new post of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary for technology, the effort also is being hampered by lack of money for a key program at the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm deeply concerned about it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., who closely follows technology issues on Capitol Hill `` I would say that at this point the administration has not got their act together: first, in terms of making the key appointments that would be involved in policy in this area; and, of course, establishing the policy framework necessary to be able to go ahead.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science, research and technology subcommittee, which is set to hear testimony Tuesday by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambler </PERSON>, who last December was named acting undersecretary for technology but is planning to retire at the end of March. At his confirmation hearing in January, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said the role of the undersecretary for technology `` is an extremely high priority'' and that he was concerned about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capability in high technology. So far, however, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> has been unable find a willing candidate for the undersecretary job, which pays $ 82,500 a year. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said a number of people _ including <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> _ had been offered the post but had turned it down. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the failure to implement a pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the judiciary and top federal executives apparently figured in the decisions by several people who would have had to take a substantial cut from their private-sector incomes Under a reorganization plan approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> late last year, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> includes: _ The Office of Technology Policy, a policy analysis and development organization; _ The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which promote cooperative joint ventures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry in areas of research and technology development; _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION>, which works in areas ranging from automated manufacturing, electronics and materials research to computer science and technology, building and fire research, and biotechnology; _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for developing federal telecommunications technology policies; _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which disseminates the <PERSON> Ambler </PERSON> said in a speech last month that the office of the undersecretary for technology `` is a catalyst, a friend, a forum, a listening post and a voice in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for technology-based industry.'' At the same time, he emphasized that `` it is the job of the private sector to develop and sell goods and services. Government has never been successful in showing industry how to do its job, and there is absolutely no reason to think that will change in the future.'' Legislation passed last fall also established within <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> an Advanced Technology Program, intended to be a civilian counterpart of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s highly touted <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The program is designed to coordinate development of emerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; foster industry, government and university partnerships, and monitor cooperation between federal and regional agencies. However, so far the program has no funding either for this fiscal year or in the fiscal 1990 budget. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that in the absence of leadership by the administration on issues related to civilian technology, `` we may go ahead with proposed legislation which would compel them to start focusing on this.'' `` What we also need are some short-term decisions having to do with selecting targets of opportunity and providing some funding for civilian advanced technology projects this fiscal year,'' the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat said. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who serves along with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on the science, research and technology subcommittee, said that after a meeting last Wednesday with <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, he is optimistic about the longer-range prospects for developing the <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> into an effective agency. `` I think that given the feelings of the secretary of commerce, it's going to be an important new feature on the landscape,'' the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican said. `` I think he's committed to it. He just has to get people to work for him.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a test program ordered by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has begun reimbursing some of the expenses of active-duty servicemen who adopt children. The unusual program, which provides up to $ 2,000 to offset the expenses of legally adopting a child, is set to last through the end of the current fiscal year _ or until Sept. 30 _ unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> votes to make the benefit permanent. The adoption reimbursement program was formally launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel chief, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, last September and as of Dec. 31, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had processed 69 claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lagged behind the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in publishing their regulations and are only now handling claims. The test was ordered in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1988 budget bill and was championed by Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>. It was proposed not only as a morale-building benefit that might play a role in keeping men and women in the military, but also as a benefit for adoptive parents that parallels the cost of health care provided to women bearing babies in military hospitals. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nonetheless opposed the program, arguing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was n't providing any extra money for the payments and it could n't afford to tap other accounts. `` In the current fiscal climate, this program might negatively affect the other personnel and family initiatives that benefit a greater percentage of the military population,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> argued unsuccessfully. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not requested any funding for the program in the fiscal 1990 budget pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but promised it would `` look at the results of the test program to determine further action.'' The reimbursement payments are available to anyone on active duty `` who initiates adoption proceedings after Sept. 30, 1987, and before Oct. 1, 1989,'' the Pentagon regulation states. `` Benefits paid under the test program may be paid only after the adoption is final. The adoption of stepchildren does not qualify for reimbursement under this program.'' Service members who adopt more than one child can claim a maximum $ 5,000 per year, the regulation adds. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adoption </ORGANIZATION>, a group headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the average agency adoption fee was about $ 6,000 in 1987.

<TEXT>
 A wiry-haired socialist with free market notions has touched off a battle of ideas in the party that created <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s welfare state _ challenging some of its basic principles. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kjell-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>, a five-foot-six dynamo, is at the center of a reform movement in his <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed for all but six of the last 56 years. Since the Social Democrats were re-elected in September, they have loosened foreign currency exchange rules, outlined tax reforms, reduced farm subsidies and warned the troubled textile industry that government help is tapering off. By fighting entrenched interests in order to give socialism the new direction he thinks it requires, the 57-year-old <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> has alarmed party stalwarts and the unions. The internal debate he has set off is known as `` the war of the roses,'' after the party's red rose election symbol. `` We must stop slandering the market economy, defined as decentralized economic decision-making, competition on free markets and a free choice of consumer goods,'' <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> wrote in a recent edition of <LOCATION> Tiden </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` On the global level, it is known that market economy in this form has won a complete victory over its only known alternative, the planned economy.'' <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> said a tax policy which takes half the wages of the average worker _ as does <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s _ has made `` a historical contribution but should now come to an end.'' Although as finance minister he collects some of the highest taxes in the world _ 72 percent as a maximum on high incomes _ <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> consistently ranks near the top in popularity polls. A quarterly survey published by <ORGANIZATION> PK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banken </ORGANIZATION>, a state-owned bank, said <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s proposals amount to `` the introduction of a new economic policy regime in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.'' In the draft budget presented last month, <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> announced measures to cool the overheated economy by stimulating supply rather than lessening demand. Among the proposals were lowering trade barriers and taxes. The debate he is stirring comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in its 100th year, reviews its platform. A party committee charged with the task is to offer a new draft program by August. Although the Social Democrats espouse undiluted socialism, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is far from being socialist. About 90 percent of production is in private hands, and big businesses like <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ericsson </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications group play by capitalist rules. While a few big companies drive <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s economy, the government controls transportation, communications, health care and other services. Advocates say the system gives <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> one of the world's highest living standards, with basic necessities provided for everyone. Critics say that while the country may seem rich, the individual Swede, after paying taxes and high living costs, often has little money left over to spend as he chooses. <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> has said he wants to change the pervasiveness of the public sector, which employs about half the work force and which he says has grown fat and inefficient. An opening salvo in the ideological debate was fired in January by <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s treasury officials, who drafted a working paper for a closed meeting of the Scandinavian Labor Movement. It suggested citizens be allowed to choose private alternatives to public institutions such as day care centers and hospitals. The report met with such fierce opposition that the meeting tried to suppress it. When it leaked last month, it created a furor among traditionalists in the party. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sten </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> led a counterattack against what he saw as a threat to the party's underpinnings. He likened the reformists among his colleagues to rivals in the non-socialist opposition. `` That the Liberals and Conservatives want to undermine the general welfare is not so strange,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> wrote in the socialist daily Arbetet. `` But now this has gained a foothold within the workers' movement, disquieting me and others.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> was compelled to defend <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> and reassure his party. `` The general welfare policy will not move,'' <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said in a television interview. `` We managed to retain it during the difficult years, and we're not abandoning it now.'' He denied that a battle was being waged between <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s pragmatists and socialist orthodoxy `` In the government there is no right wing. There is just the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government, and that is to the left,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON>'s article attacked the argument that a free market inevitably leads to social gaps and impoverishment of the worker. `` It is definitely misleading to describe capitalism _ not to speak about the market economy _ as the source of all misery and injustice, whereas the public sector is described as a perfectly working idyll,'' he wrote in <LOCATION> Tiden </LOCATION>. The conservative newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> called the article `` one of the most remarkable political pieces of recent years'' and said <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> `` has decided to start the fight for a modernization of Swedish social democracy.'' Aftonbladet, the popular tabloid owned by the blue-collar union LO, accused <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> of trying to throw the `` basic ideals on the garbage heap of history and attack the soul of the party.''

 Once congressional pages together, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> both realized their dream of being elected to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. As if that were not unusual enough, both also were witnesses to the rarest of events: an attack by gunmen on the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., and <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, R-Mo., stood together on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor last Wednesday to mark the 35th anniversary of an event they said will always seem fresh in their The two were 16-year-old pages and roommates on March 1, 1954, the day that four neatly dressed Puerto Ricans walked into the public galleries, unfurled a flag, shouted `` Free Puerto Rico!'' and began shooting randomly from large automatic pistols. House Speaker <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ who had been counting heads in a quorum call on a bill dealing with migrant laborers _ banged the gavel. A few congressmen fell, bleeding. Some raced for the doors. Some hid under the tables. `` As one who has never been particularly age-conscious, I stand in awe of the fact that this event occurred 35 years ago, and I remember it as though it were yesterday,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> had just gotten out of his seat on the Democratic side in the rear of the chamber when the shooting started. `` When the shots started to be fired, they sounded like firecrackers going off,'' <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> said last week. `` There were a lot of them and they were different-sounding because there were several weapons that were being used. The only thing that made it clear they were n't firecrackers is that I got sprinkled with some of the marble that flaked off.'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> thought the noise was firecrackers, too, `` but when I looked up, I could see fire coming out of the end of the barrels of those guns.'' Wounded were Reps. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Mich.; <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, D-Md; <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, D-Ala.; and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, D-Tenn. All Before it was over, a photographer snapped a picture of <LOCATION> Kanjorski </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> carrying one of them off on a stretcher. As bad as the moment was, the news photo gave <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> temporary celebrity status among their peers, and linked them together in time. `` All through our lives we have been very close friends,'' <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> said. He classified the odds of both becoming congressmen as `` remote,'' even though he said both dreamed about the possibility. One of the attackers died in 1979, and the other three were given presidential clemency the same year after 25 years in prison. <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> four years later. `` I might say it was a great pleasure for me personally when my friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON> joined us here two terms ago,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said. `` He and I were roommates and colleagues of that era, and it was great to see an old buddy come back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have often thought it -LRB- the shooting -RRB- was a terrible thing to have happened, but since it did, I was glad I was here to observe that little anecdote in American history,'' <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> said.

 The White House struggle to save <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination has turned into the first major test of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political mettle and is being watched as a barometer of how he'll deal with a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> dominated Republican strategists say the stakes are high for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in office only six weeks. `` He's got to fight. To let the Democrats shove him around or to knuckle under to them this early in his presidency would only give them more feeling that they could go after him down the road,'' said <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who was the first political director for President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political director under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should make clear that there will be political consequences for anyone who opposes the administration. `` If he just sort of smiles and forgets it, I think it's the same as putting up a ` kick me' sign,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` He's got to put this in the memory bank and, as he has opportunities out of public view, he's got to get even'' as he makes decisions and doles out political favors over the next four years, said <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. While the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> still talked about victory, <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said there was virtually no chance Tower could win confirmation as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, with the Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Even among Republicans, there is a feeling that the White House has not done a good job with the Tower nomination. The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator has been buffeted by accusations of excessive drinking, womanizing and conflict of interest with defense contractors. `` Up until now, the Brits have had better scandals,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>. `` This one is understandable _ drinking and sex.'' The White House has not tried to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by drumming up a groundswell of public support for Tower. `` The public's uncomfortable with the rumors,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` There's no pro-drunkenness caucus out there.'' In a speech last week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> observed, `` This is a tough town _ a lot of rumors out there.'' He has spoken out on Tower's behalf numerous times, discounting the allegations against his nominee as mere innuendo. A White House official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not trying to mobilize a national campaign on Tower's behalf because it is not the kind of issue that can generate much public support. Instead, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is struggling to find a few votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a battle with an audience of about eight people,'' said the official, who declined to be identified by name. `` I do n't see any point in making this personal,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said recently. `` There's no point making this into a fight.'' Looking ahead to relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after the Tower affair, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We're going to have to work together on a lot of other issues.'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, a top lieutenant to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said the president `` understands politics and he knows that most people do n't hold grudges and can move from one issue to the next without a lot of bias.'' By the traditional rules of politics, Tower's nomination should have been safe. As a former senator, he was a member of the congressional club, the beneficiary of special courtesies and favors. However, the normal scenario turned into chaos for Tower when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, a conservative activist, testified publicly about Tower's drinking. `` What <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> did was to present an uneasy group of senators who really did n't like <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> anyway with a fig leaf,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> specialist on the presidency. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes ethics and personal conduct almost a hallmark of his administration and gets hoisted on his own petard,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. The White House has acknowledged shortcomings in handling Tower's nomination, blaming some of the problems on incompetence and inexperience among the new staff <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> traces the mishandling back to December, even before Tower was actually nominated. `` They let the naming of him dangle for two months. Secondly, after they named him they did n't do anything. They just let it sit there,'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> said. `` When the negative stuff came out they did n't seem to put together a campaign to support him,'' <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> added. `` The only support that I see is coming out of the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators. `` Just as this thing is beginning to heat up,'' he added, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> goes off to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and takes with him his chief of staff and half his staff, leaving nobody to stay behind and fight the good fight.'' It was on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first full day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted along party lines 11-9 against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and his formidable <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reputation are under siege in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but the once-pristine reputation of his principal opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, has been assailed in the battle as well. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, hailed for years as a principled, non-partisan, hard-working <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is now accused of making a purely partisan grab for power. `` There's a lot more going on here than meets the eye,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who characterizes allegations against Tower of excessive drinking and suspect ties to defense contractors as `` total character assassination.'' `` It's a power struggle,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s opponents are contending he is not the person to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> rather than admitting they disagree violently with his policies.'' Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> is `` obviously'' partisan. He has said Republicans intend to examine `` the allegation that <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has some motive'' in his conduct of the Tower affair. In <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s case, what is under attack is the reputation he has built as a highly regarded and respected architect of defense policy who puts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security interests ahead of other considerations. `` It is <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s unique qualities of intelligence, thoroughness and thoughtfulness that have, with good reason, made him one of the most respected members _ if not the most respected member _ of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said last week. Although many Republicans aim the `` power play'' charge against <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and the Democrats, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, walks a middle line On the one hand, he implies there are partisan motivations behind the assault on Tower. On the other, he absolves <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> from complicity. `` It's not a power grab of trying to run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' he says. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues are _ predictably _ even more emphatic. `` There has been no power grab by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> or anyone else; that's hogwash,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a Tower opponent who opened a counterattack of his own `` There is no question about the partisan nature of Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and his assault on this body,'' he said. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says developments have put him in a no-win situation. `` When you agree with them, they say, ` He's a statesman,''' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` If you disagree, they say, ` How can he be so partisan?' `` Either I would be a scapegoat because I was taking on a president, or I would be covering up the alleged transgressions of the nominee.'' Is he upset by the `` power play'' accusations? `` That's part of the process,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` They've got to find something to throw at me. The only way to handle a situation where you do n't have the evidence on your side is to go after the person who is making the case. The effort here is to basically destroy my credibility.'' Is he attempting to assert power over the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, to prevent a strong-willed leader like Tower from taking over? `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> knows better than that,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> says. `` It's preposterous to think that anyone can run the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. As the battle over the Tower nomination raged in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, The Wall Street Journal reprinted a December 1972 article from The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporting that <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had pleaded either guilty or no contest in 1964 _ when he was 26 _ to leaving the scene of an accident. The article implied <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> had been drinking at the time and the senator admits it. `` I pled guilty to leaving the scene, paid my fine, apologized to all concerned and, at age 26, learned a valuable lesson which I have not forgotten,'' he says. `` I do n't know that this is relevant ... but I guess when you're in this kind of fight everything is fair game. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> likes to point out that before the presidential election he and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, emphasizing the importance of high-quality nominees for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> posts. They said the letter was sent `` principally to avoid any suggestion of partisan motivation.'' It has n't worked out that way.

 <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who headed the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for 32 years until his ouster last year, will not attend Tuesday's meeting of the party's governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper reported.

The 76-year-old <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who now holds the newly created post of party president, also missed the committee's last meeting. In the last years of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rule, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economy fell into decline and independent groups agitating for multiparty democracy began to gain wide influence. Reformers who advocate allowing opposition candidates to compete in elections have now obtained a foothold in the heights of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The reformers include politicians thrown out of the leadership when <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> was installed as party chief in 1956, the year Soviet tanks quashed the Hungarian uprising.

 The dollar fell against the Japanese yen, while share prices also lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the trading day Monday. The dollar opened at 127.55 yen and moved higher to peak at 127.68 yen before closing the day slightly lower at 127.63 yen. It was down 0.49 yen from last Friday's 128.12-yen finish. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 73.63-point loser last week, also shed 123.24 points, or 0.38 percent, for 31,876.86 points by the end of the trading day. Dealers said trading was directionless in the absence of major market-affecting news, but concern over possible Japanese discount rates hikes was sending the dollar and <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> lower `` There is talk of rate hikes here and market participants are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese securities firm. `` Otherwise, trading is directionless.'' He added that the currency fluctuated in wide ranges last week because of technical adjustments and economic news, including a West German decision not to raise its interest rates. `` This week, people are waiting for a conference Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> and the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures due out Friday,'' the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Soviet Icebreaker Narrowly Averts Nuclear Disaster, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear-powered Soviet icebreaker came within 40 minutes of a meltdown last fall when an operator mistakenly drained cooling water from a reactor, according to a Soviet newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, a state-run newspaper that covers shipping, said the incident occurred Nov. 11 aboard the Rossiya while it was docked at <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles north of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. It was there for routine changing of a filter in a reactor, the newspaper said. The reactor was shut down, and cooling water was supposed to be drained before changing the filter, the newspaper explained. But a chief physicist aboard the ship gave incorrect instructions to an operator, who opened a drainage valve on the ship's other reactor, which was in operation, <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said in its Saturday editions. The main supply of cooling water was drained off mistakenly. Just 30 or 40 minutes' worth of backup water was left in a reservoir before the reactor would have melted down and released radiation, the newspaper said. It took four minutes to bring the problem under control, according to <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarakanov </PERSON>, the newspaper's <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> correspondent. He did not provide details of what action was taken. Radiation could have spread from the ship to the city of 440,000 people, <PERSON> Tarakanov </PERSON> indicated. <ORGANIZATION> Vodny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> comes out three times a week. There was no explanation for the four-month delay in reporting the incident. A meltdown, the worst possible nuclear accident, occurs when the reactor core overheats to such a degree that the fuel begins melting, as happened at <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in 1979. If the fuel penetrates its protective housing, radioactive materials are released into the environment. The Rossiya was launched from the <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in 1983 and went into operation in 1986, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships. It is one of five ships in the Arktika class run by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Two pressurized water reactors drive the Rossiya's steam turbines to generate a total 75,000 horsepower, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s. In January, the ship made headlines when it rescued Soviet researchers stranded on a drifting ice floe north of <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted a nuclear power official as saying there have been no accidents aboard the Rossiya or four other nuclear-powered icebreakers. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuravkov </PERSON> also said the reactors on board the ships are a different design from those at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, where a reactor exploded and caught fire April 26, 1986, killing at least 31 people and spewing radiation worldwide. `` An operator can not race it to a critical state, as happened at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> atomic power station,'' <PERSON> Zhuravkov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The article quoted <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabkanov </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> port in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, as saying safety of nuclear-powered vessels is `` very reliable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said people in <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> are alarmed that a nuclear-powered ship, a sister of the Rossiya called Sevmorput, was heading their way. Government authorities in another <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> port, <LOCATION> Nakhodka </LOCATION>, supported residents' calls to close the harbor to the Sevmorput. There was no indication the people quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> had heard about the reported incident on the Rossiya.

<HEAD>Mouse Experiments Point Way to Possible Muscular Dystrophy Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a finding hailed as an exciting step toward treating humans for the most common form of muscular dystrophy, scientists have corrected a muscle defect in mice by injecting immature muscle cells. Mice that could not make a protein called dystrophin in their muscles began to produce it after the injections, two teams of researchers report. In humans, lack of the protein causes <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON> muscular dystrophy, the most common and severe form of the disease. The research represents `` the most exciting approach for human therapy that, in my opinion, has ever come along,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Preliminary experiments in a limited number of <LOCATION> Duchenne </LOCATION> patients may begin this summer, after researchers from several nations meet in June to discuss the issues involved, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Those studies, focusing on single muscles or a few muscles, could lead to larger human studies. It is too early to say when the injection procedure could be made widely available, if it proves useful, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. One mouse study was performed by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Childrens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Partridge </PERSON> and others at the <ORGANIZATION> Charing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We basically have the first step toward a potential to do therapeutics. It looks promising,'' said <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Their study is `` extremely exciting work,'' said <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsat </PERSON>, professor of neurology and pharmacology at the <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and director of neuromuscular research at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The other mouse research was done by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Neuromuscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neurological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Both studies were presented at a recent meeting of muscular dystrophy researchers in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON> muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes boys almost exclusively, appearing in about one in every 3,500 male births in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It causes a progressive weakening and wasting of voluntary muscles. Most patients must use wheelchairs by age 12, and most die in their early 20s. The experiments tested an experimental therapy using immature muscle cells called myoblasts, which normally help repair muscle fibers that have broken because of injury or strenuous exercise. Researchers injected myoblasts into mice that lacked dystrophin and found that the myoblasts fused with muscle fibers. Once inside a fiber the myoblast nucleus provided a gene that allowed the fiber to begin producing dystrophin. The scientists could not demonstrate any impact on dystrophy symptoms because, for reasons not well understood, mice that lack dystrophin show no outward symptoms in the first place. <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON>'s team, which reported its results recently in the British journal <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>, found that mouse myoblasts fused to muscle fibers in 39 of 70 mice that received injections in a leg muscle Those fibers produced up to 30 percent to 40 percent of the normal amount of dystrophin, which probably would be enough to ease muscular dystrophy symptoms greatly in humans, <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON>'s experiment involved injecting human myoblasts into the thighs of about two dozen mice. Some dystrophin appeared in every mouse, <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said. Segments of muscle fiber that began generating dystrophin resisted degeneration, while other segments broke down, <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said. `` I'm very optimistic'' about possible use in humans, he said. Scientists still must determine whether the human body would reject transplanted myoblasts, which probably would be taken from a patient's brother or father, <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said. Injections would have to be spaced no more than about two-fifths of an inch apart. Treating every muscle would be impractical, so researchers would have to choose those that permit breathing, arm motion and other key functions, <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Kunkel </PERSON> also said the injections probably could not treat heart damage caused by <PERSON> Duchenne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> said the heart damage rarely kills or causes severe disability now, but if patients were allowed to live to ages 30 or 40, it may have to be addressed.

 A professor's widow is donating his scientific papers to the university that fired him in 1953 for refusing to say whether he had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s personal and scientific papers will be presented Tuesday to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> where the professor of biochemistry spent five years on the most important cancer research of his career. `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> did n't have any animosity about the people of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION>,'' said his widow, Dr. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> never lived in the past. If something happened, you just forget it and go on.'' Some are calling it a final act of forgiveness on behalf of the professor, one of many faculty members to be fired during that period in American history when the country was gripped by fear of communism. Mrs. <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> said her husband, who died in 1987 at age 73, would have wanted the papers where he began his most important work, including development of a model for studying cancerous liver tumors. Mrs. <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>, an associate professor at <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where her husband also worked, collaborated with him on many of the later papers. On Tuesday, she will begin delivering shopping bags full of manuscripts, photographs and personal correspondence dating to the early 1940s. Among the material are two films showing Nobel Prize-winning scientists repeating their most important experiments, movies that <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> made for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the papers belong there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, the university's curator of manuscripts, said <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s scientific papers will shed light on the development of the university's medical school. The personal and political papers also will document the events of the late 1940s and early 1950s, including <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s dismissal. `` These events should be studied by every generation of student so that they can ward against these kind of things happening in the future. That will be the lesson of the manuscripts,'' said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. As in many other cases during the anti-communist hearings of Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, many prominent people stood silent when <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> was called to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to testify before congressional committees. The hearings reached into campuses, with more than 100 faculty members like <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> being fired for refusing to snitch on colleagues, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> professor who wrote a recently published book on <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> and 25 of his colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s, when fascism was taking hold in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and `` it was a matter of pride to be a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The group focused on improving the working conditions at the school, said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, and by 1945, three years before he went to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> had left the party. But four years earlier, <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s friend, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Albaum </PERSON>, whom he had met at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, told a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state committee about <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>'s party membership. <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> was pegged as a security risk and was barred from service in World War II. Another colleague named him at a hearing in 1951, triggering the proceedings that led the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> to fire him two years later when he cited his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions about his political affiliation. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON>, approached about the book in the early 1980s, was still reluctant to reveal whether he had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was the fundamental point of principle. In 1953, he would n't answer the question when they asked, ` Are you a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>?''' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. `` He felt that was a question that was inappropriate.'' <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> returned to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> to address a conference at the medical school in 1973, the year <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> cites as the end of the `` inquisition'' for <PERSON> Novikoff </PERSON> because he was cleared of being a security risk. He returned again in 1983 to receive an honorary degree.

 Five years ago, young <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> penned a message of hope, stuffed it in a bottle and dropped it in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` My name is <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON>,'' wrote the then-9-year-old girl. `` If anybody finds this, please write me and let me know where and when you found it. Thank you.'' Last month, <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> got a pen pal beyond the reach of most childhood dreams. A Moroccan sailor named <PERSON> Elaroui </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdellatif </PERSON> found the aged bottle and tattered letter Feb. 2 on the shore of <LOCATION> Laayoune </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast in northwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I did n't think it would go to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON>, standing again at the shoreline where she launched her childhood wish March 12, 1984. `` I remember throwing it in. And I did n't think it would go too far.'' At first it did n't. On March 28, 1984, <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON>, back home in <LOCATION> Gradyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, received a letter from a <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> couple who had vacationed just up the shore from where the girl had stayed with her family.

She said they told her they had placed another note in the bottle, asking the finder to write `` the little girl.'' `` He said that he'd like to visit <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> recalled.

<HEAD>Blind Workers Demanding Equal Pay For Equal Work</HEAD>

 Blind employees at a workshop established to rehabilitate them say they're being exploited and are demanding the same wages their sighted counterparts get for comparable work. But the founder of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lighthouse </LOCATION> for the Blind says the workshop trains blind people for work in the private sector and is not required to pay the minimum wage. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the workshop's wages, and Lighthouse officials are to appear next month before an administrative law judge to defend the separate wage scales for blind and sighted employees. `` I think they're trying to have more of a factory out there than to do something for the blind,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON>, a former Lighthouse employee who led a workers' strike in August and was laid off in January. The dispute comes at a time when the blind are increasingly questioning their treatment at such organizations. About 100 similar workshops employ 6,000 visually impaired people nationwide. Employees at workshops in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> have formed unions in the wake of wage and labor disputes. Unionization efforts by workers in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, were denied by an appeals court. `` Blind people have been exploited in workshops since workshops came into being,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gashel </PERSON>, director of governmental affairs for the National Federation of the Blind in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` When you're paying $ 2.10 an hour you're going to have a lot of wage disputes,'' added the federation's president, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>. `` It's not enough money to live on.'' In <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, 14 blind workers, carrying canes and wearing signs reading `` Lighthouse wages are from the Dark Ages,'' walked off their jobs in August to protest the $ 2.05 hourly wage and their $ 65-a-month health insurance fee. They want the Lighthouse to pay them the same $ 3.35 minimum wage other employees receive. The workers returned to work two weeks later, union cards were distributed and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has since ordered a union election. Negotiations have begun with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. The issue stems in part from a clause in the Fair Labor Standards Act that allows sheltered workshops to pay subminimum wages. The provision bases a subminimum wage on how much the worker produces compared with an experienced, non-impaired worker in the same job. The national federation wants to change that provision. In the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case, blind workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blind </ORGANIZATION> sought to unionize in 1982 and went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The high court let stand a lower-court ruling ordering the workshop to recognize the workers as a bargaining unit. The workshop had contended the workers were clients receiving rehabilitation rather than private employees. Lighthouse officials used the same argument in a <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> hearing. `` We're a rehabilitative facility,'' said Lighthouse founder <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>. `` We like to take people, train them and place them in the private sector.'' He said, however, that most people who come to work at the Lighthouse remain there because they are n't capable of working elsewhere. The non-profit Lighthouse in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> started in a garage in 1955 and now employs 55 workers _ about 40 of whom are blind _ and five staff members, <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said. It is under contract to the federal government to produce military items such as helmet chin straps and pads, and supports itself with the government contracts and donations. <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> and Lighthouse worker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> dispute Crane's figures on the number of employees, saying only 25 are blind. `` There are more sighted people there than blind,'' said <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> would not comment further. <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON> said that despite the workshops' benevolent origins, the operators underestimate the capabilities of the blind. `` What they think is that if you're blind you ca n't really be expected to do anything much,'' he said. `` They think that if they're giving you $ 2 an hour they're being charitable to you. It's unreasonable to expect someone to produce and then not be paid for their production.

 A reseacher bitten by a deadly viper has stabilized and wo n't receive antivenins obtained from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with help from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> unless his condition worsens, doctors say. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, 78, remained in serious but stable condition today at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said Sunday <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> had been moved out of intensive care into a regular nursing unit. `` His condition has not changed,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. `` He's resting comfortably, and he's had lots of friends visiting him.'' <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> likely would remain hospitalized for at least two to three more weeks, <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. He checked into the hospital Wednesday. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serpentarium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at the university's Research Park, was bitten Tuesday on the left hand by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a saw-scaled viper. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the venom of dozens, but he had no immunity to the viper. It is one of 1,000 poisonous snakes kept at his lab, where venom is extracted for research and the manufacture of antivenins. The serpentologist's case drew the attention of <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, special assistant to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who coordinated the acquisition of antivenins from the three countries and expedited their shipment to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. All the shipments had arrived by Sunday. `` None have been used, because there are sometimes serious reactions to antivenins and -LRB- doctors -RRB- do n't want to give them to him unless they have to,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> explained. The reactions could include lung and kidney problems, he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said `` we want to express our appreciation to everyone who has worked so hard in obtaining the antivenins.'' The viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to produce fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation. A lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s fibrinogen level was near zero Wednesday. Doctors were replacing it with transfusions and it appeared <PERSON> Haast </PERSON>'s body had begun to produce the substance. His fibrinogen level improved to about one-third of normal by Sunday, still `` dangerously low,'' <PERSON> Dwan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haast </PERSON> had been treated earlier with antivenins from the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> and from a lab in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but they did not work as well as expected. <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has often called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the `` great Satan.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Soviet Pentecostals are leaving their country for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the guise of being Jewish emigres, a newspaper reported. The emigration of Pentecostals, who claim to suffer discrimination in their homeland, apparently has the blessing of government officials in several countries who are assisting their passage, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` We're not sure of the reason why the Soviets have allowed the Pentecostals to leave,'' said <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Duss </PERSON>, a refugee specialist with the World Relief agency in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets have turned a blind eye, the Israelis have turned a blind eye, but the important thing is they are getting out of the country.'' `` It's not a secret,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchuk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, himself a Soviet emigre. Refugee workers say Pentecostals renounce their Soviet citizenship in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, obtain visas from the Dutch or American embassy and come to refugee camps in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A spokesman at the Dutch embassy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> who spoke on condition he remain anonymous denied to The Associated Press his country was issuing visas identifying Pentecostals as Jews. Officials at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy did n't comment immediately. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s annual review of human rights last month found signs of significant reform in Soviet policies during the past year, including increased emigration for Pentecostals as well as Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans. <PERSON> Shevchuk </PERSON> has traveled throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> raising funds to support Pentecostals in Italian refugee camps. He led a contingent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostals </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in late Feburary to arrange sponsors for the refugees. One of the pastors accompanying him, Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schenck </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Covenent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Tonawanda </LOCATION>, said he hopes to sponsor 100 refugees. `` We want to literally sponsor a colony,'' <PERSON> Schenck </PERSON> said. `` We want to do for the Russian Pentecostals what <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> did for the Russian Jews,'' he said, referring to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood where many Jewish emigres have settled. Up to 300 other Pentecostals will be placed in other churches in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. About 120 Pentecostals are already living near <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, he said. Refugee workers say more than 2,000 Pentecostals left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year and up to 10,000 may emigrate this year. Soviet Pentecostals, who number about 700,000, believe in everyday manifestations of the Holy Spirit, speak in tongues and practice faith healing. They claim to have been forced into the Soviet countryside and denied good schooling and jobs. `` When we were singing Christmas carols, they caught us and put us in jail,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Malischuk </PERSON>, 27, an artist staying in the Italian town <PERSON> Olevano </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> with his wife and two children. `` Everyone was fined and laid off from work.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Povorzynk </PERSON>, 40, a furniture maker staying with his wife and three children in the village of <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION>, said he was drafted into the military and refused to take the military oath. `` They put me in a psychiatric hospital and then sentenced me to four years in jail,'' <PERSON> Povorzynk </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 300 for Smoking Violations In Ban's First Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said today that they had already hauled into jail about 300 violators of a tough anti-smoking law that took effect a day earlier. Those arrested were locked in holding cells until charges could be prepared against them. After a few hours, they were released pending trial. The dragnet snagged not only scofflaws, but unwitting violators as well. One 19-year-old youth arrived today at the police station, puffing on a cigarette, carrying food for a friend arrested earlier for unauthorized smoking. The teen-ager was thrown into the cell with his friend after police explained the smoking ban applies in police stations too. The new ordinance bans smoking in most public places, including buses, restaurants, government offices, hospitals and theaters in the city of about 1 million, part of metropolitan <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated for smoking face a $ 10 dollar fine, 10 days in jail, or both. `` No complaints so far,'' said Col. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, police station commander and a reformed smoker, speaking about the crackdown. `` The people -LRB- of the city -RRB- are even pleased because we are protecting them.'' City officials said they will put up signs along municipal boundaries warning people they are entering `` a non-smoking city.'' Vendors selling cigarettes to drivers and passengers of jeeps, the most common means of public transport, warned their customers to stash the cigarettes if their vehicles enter <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But several people complained that they were unaware of the ban until they were hauled off public transportation or detained in public buildings. `` I just arrived from <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and I did not know that there was an anti-smoking ordinance here in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' salesman <PERSON> Cesario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ong </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. He was among 13 people arrested Sunday during spot checks of passenger jeeps along the city's <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. The ordinance is part of a larger anti-smoking campaign which <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials say will include a $ 10,000 media campaign against cigarettes. A private health organization, the Tri-Chest Societies on Cigarette Smoking and Health, said smoking causes about 85 percent of lung cancer deaths in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. But some radio commentators complained that if city officials are worried about public health, they should first crack down on smoke-belching jeeps and buses which clog traffic in metropolitan <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The Philippine Daily Inquirer balked, wondering if police should not spend more time protecting Filipinos from more dangerous criminals in a country with one of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s highest crime rates. `` Residents may take comfort in the knowledge that while they may fall into the hands of lawless elements, at least they will not die of cancer,'' the paper said.

 A concert billed as an `` Aryan Woodstock'' for skinheads and white supremacists turned out to be `` boring and uncomfortable'' because of rain, a lack of food and a court-ordered ban on music. About 100 people representing half a dozen white supremacist groups gathered Saturday at a private ranch about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, but were far outnumbered by about 400 protesters and 500 police officers. `` They talked about girls. They gropingly discussed ` white power.' They pranced about with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> flags and insignia, but they never discussed the ideology of fascism or of anything else,'' wrote <PERSON> Cherie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, a former reporter who gained entrance to the event. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, who did not specify how she managed to attend the rally in the heart of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s wine country, described the event in an article in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was simply boring _ and uncomfortable,'' she said. `` The great majority had brought neither rain gear nor food. Morale hit bottom when police refused to let the daughter of white supremacist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzger </PERSON> return with $ 100 worth of pizzas.'' The event originally was touted as something to bring together thousands of white supremacist youths. The skinhead bands Midtown Boot Boys from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the Hammerheads from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> annd <PERSON> Kakenkreuz </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> were expected to perform. But <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Superior Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> ruled Friday that rally organizers could n't have music without a permit. So participants spent most of the day glaring at reporters and protesters from a hill. The gathering was held out of view of the public, which was not allowed entrance to the ranch. There were a few clashes between white supremacists and protesters but no arrests or major violence. `` What you find is that the people of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> rallied against this group that has no purpose other than hate. I was real proud of the way people stood up,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. Early Sunday, the last five white supremacists left the property. Sheriff <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> estimated the cost of law enforcement at about $ 400,000.

<HEAD>Greens Set Out On A New Course With New Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUISBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has overcome factional feuding, appears to have dislodged itself from the political periphery and is on a course aimed at attracting voters by projecting a more moderate image. During a weekend congress in <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> elected a new and diverse slate of leaders to replace a leadership long dominated by radicals. There were also signs of moves within the party to consider the prospects of a possible coalition government with the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> if Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lose next year's federal elections More than 600 Greens delegates came to <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION> to try to put the party of leftists, anti-nuclear activists, feminists and environmentalists back on its feet after its radical leadership was brought down in December. On Saturday night, the Greens elected new leaders who are less controversial and more moderate than their predecessors _ an important new change for parliament's most vocal party. But <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Schily </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> and a respected member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, says he fears the party that holds 41 of the 497 seats in parliament could still face problems in improving its voter appeal. `` There are still Greens who insist on holding onto their ideological and dogmatic ideas who could hinder our access to citizens whose support we really need,'' <PERSON> Schily </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. For the first time in recent years, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>' moderate `` realos'' -LRB- realists -RRB- faction was elected as one of the top three leaders _ <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerbacher </PERSON>, a state lawmaker from <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> The two others are also completely new to the leadership: <PERSON> Verena </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>, who comes from the party's radical ranks, and <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuecks </PERSON>, whose ideas fall somewhere between those of his two colleagues. The Greens tried to find a leadership that represents a wide range of party interests and to avoid giving all power to a single faction. <PERSON> Jutta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON>, one of the radical leaders ousted in December, stunned the congress by saying she plans to quit the party next year. She blamed moderate Greens for her decision. But in an unusual show of party unity, several other <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> rejected Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON>'s attacks. The 39,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which sprang from protest groups in the late 1970s, has long been divided by ideological disagreements between radical and moderate elements. The disputes have pitted party members willing to work within established political procedures against Ms. <PERSON> Ditfurth </PERSON>'s radical wing, the so-called `` fundis'' -LRB- fundamentalists -RRB-, who see little value in pursuing a pragmatic legislative course. After fundis took control of the party leadership in 1987, they began returning the party to its radical roots and a highly confrontational style of politics. That course stalled any effective action by the party in parliament. In December, however, moderate Greens forced the fundis' ouster from the party leadership with a no-confidence vote. <ORGANIZATION> Moderate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> have an added morale boost from the strong possibility that the Alternative List, the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>' sister party in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, will join with the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to run the city's government after the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> were ousted from power in last month's state elections

 Sixteen <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> members marched for `` white power'' and a Klan leader criticized the movie `` Mississippi Burning,'' about the slayings of three civil rights workers here in the 1960s. About 100 spectators watched the march and recruitment rally with a few people heckling the marchers. About 20 law enforcement officers also kept watch. No incidents were reported in the march or during another march by about 20 Klan members later Sunday in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, about 40 miles to the east. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollub </PERSON>, the Grand Dragon for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, said the march was held in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> because of the movie, which he said presented a `` negative, hateful image of the Klan. `` Hollywood is run by Jews and integrationists,'' said <PERSON> Gollub </PERSON>, a Jew by birth. The movie, which has received seven Oscar nominations, is loosely based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers whose bodies were found in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a town of about 7,500 in central <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, 21, who was black, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 24, who were white, were shot to death. The federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating the civil rights of the three men, but no one was ever charged with murder. The Klan marchers included 10 men and six women, with 10 wearing purple, green, gold and white robes. Police cars preceded and followed the marchers through <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s small downtown area and six patrolmen walked with the group. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said his entire 16-member police force was on duty along with <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, one deputy and two county constables. At least one <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent from <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> also was present. `` We knew we were probably one of the best known cities for our size in the country, and we did n't know what to expect,'' <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> said.

 The American Academy of Pediatrics today for the first time noted evidence of medical benefits of circumcisions for newborns, but the 37,000-member organization stopped short of an all-out endorsement. The academy said the decision is best made by parents in consultation with their physicians. `` In addition to the medical aspects, other factors will affect the parents' decisions, including esthetics, religion, cultural attitudes, social pressures and tradition,'' the group said in a statement. Circumcision, removal of a band of skin encircling the tip of the penis, is the nation's most commonly performed surgical procedure, but it appears to be on the decline. The practice is a controversial issue worldwide. The first International Symposium on Circumcision was held last week in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circumcision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> and the Institute for the Advancement of Human Behavior. The symposium concluded that the medical need for circumcision is very rare and that ordinarily it should not be done, said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, a participant and co-founder of The Victims Speak, a group working against circumcision. `` Parents do not have the right to consent to unnecessary medical procedures on their children,'' and physicians have an obligation to refuse to remove normal body parts, the symposium said in a policy statement presented to the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The right to an intact body supercedes religious or cultural practices that include circumcision, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Macris </PERSON>, vice president of the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Circumcision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1971, when the pediatrics academy first took a stand on the issue, it had maintained that no absolute medical necessity existed for routine circumcision of newborns. But in its statement today, it said the procedure `` has potential medical benefits and advantages.'' It recommended that physicians explain and discuss the benefits and risks of circumcision with parents. Informed consent should be obtained before the procedure is done, said the academy, based in suburban <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. The group said it was influenced partly by studies at <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hospitals in 1985 that concluded that among the 200,000 males studied, there was an 11-fold increase in urinary tract infections in uncircumcised as compared with circumcised infants. However, the academy said all-out endorsement was not merited, in part because the study may have been flawed, thus `` conclusions regarding the relationship of urinary tract infection to circumcision are tentative.'' The academy also addressed the issue of pain caused by circumcision. It said infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia appear to experience pain. But, the academy said, `` reported experience with local anesthesia in newborn circumcision is limited, and the procedure -LRB- anesthesia -RRB- is not without risk.'' More studies are needed before routine local anesthesia can be endorsed, the group said.

 Travelers snared in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike winced at the sour taste of labor wars _ no matter if it was a honeymooning couple trapped at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> or an unhappy mother leaving her marriage behind. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> severely underestimated the impact of organized labor's effort to bring business to a halt and thousands of travelers paid the price, acknowledged Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, whose apologies were little consolation on those caught in the labor unrest. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fairlawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, got married Saturday night and had planned to take a Sunday morning flight to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. They spent the first day of their honeymoon in the <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> terminal because there were no pilots to fly the plane. `` This is ridiculous,'' said an angry <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` I'm very disappointed and disgusted with the whole ordeal.'' Amid the chaos of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alana </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> sat disconsolately on the carpet as her 3-year-old son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, played nearby. She said she was in the process of moving from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I picked a hell of a time to move,'' she said. `` I'm divorcing on top of it all. It's just real hectic to be traveling with a 3-year-old.'' The frustration and confusion was replayed at airports around the country on the second day of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike, supported by nearly 95 percent of pilots. A few kept their sense of humor. <PERSON> Salomeja </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was trying to depart <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and came to the airport despite warnings it would be bad. `` What can I do?'' she wondered. `` There are worse things in life. I went through the war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Garber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his agency had rerouted hundreds in recent days. `` It's becoming increasingly difficult to find alternative routings, but we've been working on it for days and are accomplishing the task,'' he said. Most airlines offered varying degrees of help, except for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> is not helping at all; <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> takes passengers on standby; <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> takes passengers on standby; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> has been helping depending on availability of space, either booking them on or placing them on standby; <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> ... <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> have the same policy,'' he said. Eastern targeted some of its high-profile routes, but was unable to muster the pilots to fly many planes. Continental planes made special trips to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> to pick up stranded cruise tourists. `` We are placing the emphasis on protecting the cruise passengers, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> routes and the Northeast Shuttle,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. He admitted the airline was not finding lodging for all those left behind. `` We've been able to put many in hotels, but this is Grand Prix weekend and the hotels are totally booked,'' said <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Other events this weekend during a peak of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tourist activity were the Honda Classic PGA event in neighboring <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> and baseball spring training. At <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the strike advanced the confusion to a new dimension, with anxious travelers peppering harried Eastern employees in Spanish, French, English and Haitian Creole. `` Nobody knows nothing,'' complained 33-year-old <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rink </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` There's nobody walking around, talking to people to explain things. They need a trouble shooter.'' Bakes apologized at a news conference Sunday. `` We want to apologize for the inconvenience you've experienced,'' he said `` It's been a mess.'' Nobody had to tell <PERSON> Alana </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, plopped on the floor at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, her efforts to move far away from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> quite stymied. `` I feel for the employees at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` But I've not cared for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' service for the last two years.''

 Afghan guerrillas attacked a Kabul-bound emergency convoy and set fire to 15 vehicles, but the rest of the trucks arrived safely in the Afghan capital over the weekend, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> said. The more than 550 trucks with 6,000 tons of food and fuel from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were hit as they traveled south on the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hairatan </LOCATION>, a village on the Soviet border, the state-run radio Sunday. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said 13 tank trucks and two trucks carrying wheat were set on fire by attacking rebels. `` The opposition continued to launch attacks on convoys of food and fuel, snatching the bread from the table of our innocent people,'' Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said. `` Heavy losses and casualties were inflicted on the criminals,'' the radio broadcast said without elaborating.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Release of 188 Sikhs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge today ordered the release of 188 Sikhs jailed in a northern city since a 1984 army raid on the holiest Sikh shrine during which 1,200 people were killed, a senior government official said. Among those to be freed is <PERSON> Gurcharan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tohra </PERSON>, head of the Sikh temple management committee. The body, which controls most Sikh shrines and temple funds, is considered the most powerful Sikh organization. The prisoners' release is part of a package announced last week by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to try to end ethnic violence that has wracked the northwestern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> for seven years. Militants are fighting for an independent homeland. In June 1984, then Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered the army to raid the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> to rout Sikh militants inside. Four months later, she was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for the raid. Most of those killed in the raise were Sikhs and authorities arrested about 300 people, many of them pilgrims held for questioning but never charged. <LOCATION> Jodhpur </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Khemchandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, acting on a request by prosecutors, today ordered the release of 188 of the prisoners jailed in <LOCATION> Jodhpur </LOCATION>, said a Home Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The prisoners will be taken back to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the official said. <LOCATION> Jodhpur </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION> state, southwest of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Authorities had already released 118 prisoners, the official said. At least 2,400 people were killed by Sikh militants last year, more than double the number in 1987. More than 340 people have died this year. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population, but they are a slight majority in the northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state.

<HEAD>Gov't Orders Schools To Reopen, Sporadic Gunfire Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government declared it has regained control after the country's bloodiest riots in decades and ordered elementary schools to reopen today. It also gave a new, lower death toll. A nighttime curfew remained in effect in the capital and the country was still under martial law, which allows soldiers to search houses without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely without charge. Isolated gunfire was heard in the capital early Sunday, but there have been no significant disturbances since Friday. The rioting, which began Feb. 27, was sparked by increases in bus fares and other price increases mandated under an austerity plan demanded by foreign creditors. In a nationwide television broadcast, an aide to President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> revised downward the government's tally of the number of dead and wounded from the rioting, which began Feb. 27. He said 246 people were killed _ down from <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s previous estimate of at least 300. <PERSON> Figueredo </PERSON> said 1,800 people were injured, compared to earlier reports of at least 2,000. No explanation was given for the new figures, which were much lower than newspaper reports putting the death toll as high as 600 and the number of wounded at several thousand. Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating 2,300. <PERSON> Figueredo </PERSON> said during Saturday night's broadcast that the government was starting to reopen schools because unrest has `` been controlled and the situation ... has returned to complete normality.'' He said classes would resume today for kindergarten through sixth grade and begin later in the week for older students. It was unclear when universities would reopen. Universities have traditionally been centers of protest of government economic policies. The riots and looting broke out after sharp rises in bus fares, gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services. With its oil-based economy, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> enjoyed prosperity during the 1970s but saw its fortunes sharply decline with the price of oil in 1981. The country's $ 33 billion foreign debt makes it <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest debtor nation behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> People filed into the <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> central morgue Sunday trying to find missing relatives. <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, spokeswoman for a newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Missing, said her group had a list of hundreds of people who could not be located. She said many were assumed to be in military custody, and she accused authorities of holding back information. `` We've gone to the interior minister, we've gone to the police, but so far nothing,'' she said. `` We even have the names of children, some under the age of 7, who have n't been seen in their homes since the violence began,'' Ms. <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> added. The auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, Monsignor <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Uroza </PERSON> said Sunday that the riots were a product of poverty and frustration, and said powerful business interests and government leaders shared the blame. Celebrating Mass at <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>' Central Cathedral, <PERSON> Uroza </PERSON> said `` there are those that sacked stores, and they should seek pardon; but there are also those, especially economic and political sectors, that have sacked the country for years. They should also seek pardon.''

 Tuskegee Mayor <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> enters Tuesday's Democratic primary runoff with a historic bid: to become the state's first black congressman this century, and in a district that is three-fourths white. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is considered the underdog in seeking to become the 25th black in the 435-member <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the first from a <LOCATION> Deep </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> district where whites are in the vast majority. `` The members are watching it very closely,'' said <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> victory, she said, `` would be an extraordinary message at this point in the history of our country. Despite the symbolism, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and his opponent, Secretary of State <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, have sought to keep race out of the campaign for the 3rd Congressional District seat in mostly rural east <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The runoff winner will face state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Opelika </LOCATION>, who was a Democrat until he switched to Republican ranks last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, 46, worked for <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s ill-fated 1968 presidential campaign, but he later formed political ties to then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, supporting <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> in his 1974 gubernatorial bid. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has enlisted the aid of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in seeking a strong black voter turnout, but has said repeatedly that race is not an issue. `` I am very confident we will win support from people of both races who are interested in the best qualified candidate regardless of the color of the candidate's skin,'' he said. <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>, also 46, a former professor who narrowly led <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in a splintered Democratic field Feb. 14, is considered the frontrunner. He has the support of organized labor and has gained recognition for advocating campaign finance reform. He has not targeted Ford or made race a factor in the three-week campaign. `` Both candidates realize that going into such a short time-frame there is no advantage in going after your opponent,'' said <PERSON> Browder </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> `` Race is certainly not an issue in our campaign.'' `` Race is not as much an issue as it has been in the past,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Preuitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, a conservative who ran a close third in the primary and has since blasted <PERSON> Browder </PERSON> as a liberal who `` sold his soul to big labor bosses.'' `` He does n't want to be known as just a black candidate,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a white high school principal from <LOCATION> Notasulga </LOCATION> who is co-chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign. `` But he understood that just to make the runoff was historic.'' The last time a black reached a Democratic runoff for a congressional seat in the state was in 1978, but <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> lost to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> in west <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 7th District. <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> now sits in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Reps. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., are the only blacks to represent districts with majority white populations on the scale of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 3rd In the Deep South, Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> won a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> district that was about evenly split racially in 1986 and won re-election easily last year with strong white support. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Espy </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> entered the race with `` a proven track record with white politicians that <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> did n't have.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been mayor of Tuskegee since 1972 and helped found state and national conferences of black mayors as well as a multi-racial organization called the World Conference of Mayors. The 3rd District seat was vacated by the death in December of Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. He had kept the seat Democratic for 22 years with generally conservative, defense-oriented politics. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 37, is expected to get support from white conservative voters who backed <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, but he is a relative newcomer in state politics.

<HEAD>Arafat Offers Truce With Israel In South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has offered to revive a 1981 cease-fire with the Israelis in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments approve, newspapers said today. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a halt to guerrilla operations from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the papers reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said it will not talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted as saying that reviving the short-lived 1981 cease-fire, which was mediated by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers, `` should only take place according to our conditions.'' In an interview with editors of several <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> dailies, he stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would agree to a truce only if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` stops its raids in the region, ends its deportation of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and stops using arms against the uprising'' in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Under the 1981 accord, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> suspended operations across the Lebanese border as diplomatic efforts were made to resolve the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. The truce fell apart when the Israelis invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s reported offer came after <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> claims that recent guerrilla operations in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> violated the renunciation of terrorism <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made last December, when he also recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> lifted a 13-year-old ban on direct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> following <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration and has said guerrilla raids on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could have a negative effect on the U.S.-PLO dialogue that began three months ago. The Israelis regularly retaliate for the cross-border raids from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with air strikes and ground assaults. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was quoted today as saying: `` I can go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> only if my trip is endorsed by all Arabs.'' He was also quoted as predicting that `` an independent Palestinian state will be set up within two years.'' During the 15-month rebellion against Palestinian rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities have shot to death more the 380 Palestinians and deported dozens. More than 15 Israelis have died. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> Saturday, presided over the annual meeting of the Palestinian National Fund.

<HEAD>NATO Urges Moscow To Cut Tanks, Artillery By Two-Thirds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> today urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to cut its tanks and artillery in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by two-thirds to give impetus to new talks aimed at reducing congressional forces on the world's most heavily armed continent. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> countered with demands for percentage reductions by East and West of troops, tactical nuclear weapons and combat aircraft as well. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and `` the main categories of arms'' by 10 to 15 percent over the next two to three years. In a second phase of two to three years, further cuts of about 25 percent, or half a million men, should be made by each side, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will enter the negotiations, which formally open Thursday, with a call for lopsided <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> reductions of weaponry excluding missiles and combat aircraft. The Western military alliance maintains the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has almost a 2-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery. Along the East-West divide in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, the two blocs should agree on areas where they would reduce, limit or withdraw `` the most dangerous, destabilizing kinds of arms.'' `` Tactical nuclear arms would also be withdrawn from those zones,'' he told foreign ministers gathered in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s historic <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> palace for a three-day, 35-nation meeting preceding the opening of negotiations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also proposed separate talks on `` reducing and completely eliminating tactical nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' as soon as possible. His speech ran counter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aims to keep short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has asked <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to delay any decision on modernizing such forces for at least two years. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, speaking after <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and outlining <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s proposals for the new talks, stressed the need to maintain a nuclear presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s proposals, while differing from the West's, were worthy of serious study. `` The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations must not become a competition for who can put forward the more radical proposals,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` They are a serious quest for stability and security and not a competitive striptease.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> proposed an overall ceiling of 40,000 tanks, 33,000 artillery and 56,000 armored personnel carriers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Those totals should be equally divided on each side _ the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. He also proposed a limit of 3,200 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troop carriers stationed outside national borders on each side. That would significantly slice the Soviet armored presence in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced in December a unilateral withdrawal of six tanks divisions and 50,000 men from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the next two years. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> currently has some 10,000 tanks stationed outside its borders, meaning further cuts would be needed to meet the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a two-thirds reduction `` in the massed ranks of Soviet tanks and artillery in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and by well over half in armored troop carriers.'' This would not threaten Soviet security, he stressed, because `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will still have more tanks within the area than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> combined.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, by contrast, said he was not proposing any concrete numbers, arguing that the fixing of such ceilings should be left to experts. The 35 foreign ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> are from the nations that signed the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act _ the superpowers, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations bar <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Those 35 nations agreed in mid-January to launch two sets of arms control negotiations to enhance security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact will discuss how to reduce the conventional forces and weapons massed from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains deep inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. All 35 nations will also hold separate talks on measures to build confidence and security across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would propose at that second forum an annual exchange of information about the size, location and equipment of armed forces and urge `` random checking'' to verify that data. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the new <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks should not become bogged down in sterile arguments about data _ a key factor in the failure of 15 years of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on reducing troops and tanks in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Officials investigating computer spies who passed information from Western computers to the Soviets believe the hackers did not make a major security breach, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor said today. Interior Minister <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> called last week's breakup of the spy ring a `` major blow'' to the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. He said Friday the hackers were `` an extremely dangerous new threat'' to security but that further inquiry would be needed to determine the extent of the damage. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for chief federal prosecutor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>, said today: `` The information obtained by the hackers does not appear to be that sensitive.'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> made the comment when asked about news reports saying the hackers had mainly obtained access codewords for the computers. He said eight West Germans are still under investigation. Three men were arrested last week. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network said the hackers tapped into information from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and computers handling sensitive research on nuclear weapons. It said the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s general databank, and a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and `` Star Wars'' research computer. The television report said three hackers handed over information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at a 1985 meeting with two <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The report said authorities believe West German hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and `` were paid with cash and drugs.''

<TEXT>
 Fifty-two illegal immigrants, many of them holding plane tickets, were arrested at a suspected `` drop house'' where they apparently were waiting out a crackdown on immigrant smuggling, authorities said. The action Sunday night brought the number of undocumented aliens arrested over the weekend to 89. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been concentrating its efforts for the past week on stopping the use of commercial airlines for smuggling illegal aliens to destinations nationwide. Officers discovered the immigrants after receiving an anonymous tip from a caller who alleged a diabetic woman was being kept at the house against her will, Lt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. The report turned out to be false, but police discovered the group of adult aliens, mostly from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and notified the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. The aliens were holding airline tickets for destinations including <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. The aliens were taken to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention facilities downtown, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. Authorities estimated there are between 30 and 40 `` drop houses'' where paid smugglers keep illegal aliens in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area before sending them on to residences elsewhere. `` We're looking for all the drop houses in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, so we can put the local end of the operation out of business,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brechtel </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director for investigations.

<HEAD>Murder Charge Dropped Because Police Can't Produce Informant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The man that detectives most want to bring to trial for allegedly killing one of their colleagues is free because police played fast and loose in getting a search warrant for a drug raid, prosecutors say. Three detectives have been suspended while perjury charges are considered. The case has focused attention on how easy, and tempting, it is for police officers to obtain search warrants by citing fictitious informants. Defense lawyers contend the practice, though illegal, is routine in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and many other cities across the nation. But prosecutors and police say if the use of confidential informants is curbed, they will lose a key weapon in the war against drugs. Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, who has spent 22 years on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bench in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said judges have little choice but to trust police when they say they have an informant. `` Assuming that they were trying to trick me, how would I know it?'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. `` The informant is n't subject to cross examination, I do n't even see the informant. I have to rely on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and the law enforcement agencies. If they wanted to deceive me, it would be easy to do so.'' In the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> case, a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge dismissed all charges against <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> two weeks ago after police failed to produce a mysterious informant _ identified only as <PERSON> John </PERSON> _ who supposedly tipped them off to a cocaine dealer in the city's <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section. On Feb. 17, 1988, as four detectives prepared to break into the dealer's apartment, two shots were fired from inside the apartment. One pierced the door and felled 36-year-old detective <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, a veteran member of the elite anti-drug task force. When the detectives finally knocked down the steel-reinforced door, the apartment was empty. They rushed down a back staircase and arrested <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> and three other people on a lower floor. Prosecutors later dropped charges against the other three in return for testimony against the 33-year-old <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, who maintains he is innocent. From the outset, a weakness in the prosecution's case was that <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> did not match the informant's description of the crack dealer who occupied the apartment and presumably fired the fatal shot. According to the affidavit police submitted to obtain the search warrant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> said the dealer was Hispanic and about 5-foot-6. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> is a 6-foot Jamaican. In pretrial hearings last month, <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s attorney said <PERSON> John </PERSON> was a vital defense witness, and Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> ordered detectives <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amate </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> to bring him into court. When the detectives said they were unable to find the informant, <PERSON> Grabau </PERSON> threw out the charges and lambasted the detectives, saying he believed they had willfully disobeyed his orders. Last week, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>, assistant district attorney for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> went back into court to make an extraordinary accusation. He said the detectives had lied to him and the court about the informant, either to strengthen the case against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> or to protect the search warrant. And <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> contended the charges against <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> should not be dropped. He said the actual informant was not <PERSON> John </PERSON> _ who may or may not exist _ but another man, identified in court as `` Y.'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>'s lawyer maintains that `` Y'' is still not the right man. The judge is scheduled to consider reinstating the charges this week. In the interim, the state attorney general is considering perjury charges against the suspended detectives. None of the three officers could be reached for comment. One is on vacation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the other two did not respond to repeated messages asking them to call. Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, supervisor of the three, has repeatedly said he accepts full responsibility for the actions of the team.

<HEAD>Teen Scholarship Winner Awaits Trial for Husband's Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was praised as a model student last December whose perserverance over inner-city hardship won her a free college education that was to make her a teacher. But police allege the 18-year-old senior lived a secret life that came to a head just weeks before when she secretly married and then conspired to murder a man more than 20 years her elder. `` She seemed to be the kind of kid we were meant to help,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Raispis </PERSON>, a fellow of the Foundation for Excellence in Teaching, a private <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> institution that awarded Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and 14 other teen-agers college scholarships. `` She was overcoming all this adversity and putting on a bright face. ... We said if we could only help one kid, this has to be the one.'' Now, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, facing charges of conspiracy and murder and a possible death sentence. The young woman burst into tears last November when she learned she was named one of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholars </ORGANIZATION>, whose members get a free college education, good summer jobs and up to $ 10,000 after college in exchange for returning to teach in inner-city schools. But police suspect they were tears of frustration over her secret marriage just days earlier to 41-year-old <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. Police say Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> feared her marriage was an impossible hurdle to her future as a scholarship student and teacher. They say Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> also had a 19-year-old boyfriend in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> she was considering marrying. Police say the young woman and her husband, with whom she had never lived, went to dinner on Nov. 26. Then, investigators believe, she suggested a walk in a park on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s South Side. Minutes later, they say, two men appeared. One of them raised a handgun, fired once and killed <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> with a shot in the head, police say. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubalcava </PERSON>, 25, have been charged with conspiracy and murder along with Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Police allege that the young woman offered <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> $ 1,000 to kill <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> hired <PERSON> Rubalcava </PERSON> as the triggerman. `` These people looked like they were in love,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Colhane </PERSON>, 37, a friend of <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s. `` I'll never figure it out. I ca n't see a person being married this short amount of time and this happening. I mean, there's always divorce. This is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Despite her secret marriage, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had continued to live at home with her strict great-aunt and great-uncle. Her mother as a teen-ager handed <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> over to the relatives to raise, friends say. She never met her father. Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> always did well in school, getting mostly A's and B's, despite her fractured home life. Then she met <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a self-employed truck driver, in November 1987. In order to carry on the secret romance, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> began to skip classes, missing 50 days in one semester. To explain her absences, Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> told one teacher her father had been murdered in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and she had flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the burial, and that her great-aunt later died of an illness so she had to stay home to care for her great-uncle. The teacher later cited to the scholarship committee these family deaths as examples of the adversity Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had to overcome. Ms. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> gave up her scholarship after her arrest Jan. 21.

<HEAD>Group To Import Unapproved Drugs For AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An AIDS patient-advocacy group plans to import prescription drugs that have not been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for treatment of AIDS patients, according to a report published today. The New York-based People with <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> plans to get the drugs from sympathetic doctors in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to the report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The group will then distribute the drugs to any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome who has a note or a prescription for the drug from a doctor in this country, the newspaper said. Patients' costs would be limited to the cost of the drug. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, executive director of People with AIDS, estimated that hundreds of thousands of AIDS patients may take advantage of the program. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> announced a policy that allows people with life-threatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved drugs. Until now, those taking advantage of the policy had to find doctors in other countries to prescribe the drugs or else import only over-the-counter remedies, the Times said. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he could not say whether the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> would try to stop the People with AIDS effort. AIDS patient advocates have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, saying it has been overly cautious about approving AIDS drugs. AIDS patients say they do not have time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed controversial by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, but the federal agency says it has a responsibility to protect Americans from drugs that could be useless or harmful. The health group said the drug that is most important to them is fluconazole, a product of <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that is used to treat cryptococcal meningitis afflicting about 10 percent to 15 percent of AIDS patients. The company is seeking <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of the drug, which has been approved for sale in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 More than 20,000 Sudanese refugees have crossed into <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> recently, driven south by fierce fighting between rebel and government troops, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> official said today. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> decided Sunday to bow to pressure from politicians and army officers, and declared he will form a new government to negotiate an end to the nearly 6-year-old war in the south. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for refugees in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, said that by Sunday 17,000 refugees had arrived at <LOCATION> Bibia </LOCATION> and another 6,000 at <LOCATION> Kitgum </LOCATION>, communities just south of the Ugandan border. `` The refugees, who include a small number of soldiers, abandoned the border town of <LOCATION> Nimule </LOCATION> on Friday after learning that -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s forces were about to storm the town,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> is leader of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which wants greater autonomy for southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s Christians and animists. They are a majority in the south but are far outnumbered by the dominant Moslems of the north who control the government and economy. The clandestine rebel radio Saturday said its fighters overran <LOCATION> Nimule </LOCATION> Friday. Early last week, the rebels appealed to government troops in <LOCATION> Nimule </LOCATION> and other southern towns to evacuate or join the rebels. <LOCATION> Nimule </LOCATION> straddles the Ugandan border and controls the main road leading north to <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, besieged capital of the southernmost Sudanese province of <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION>. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugees' organization completed evacuating 3,000 Sudanese refugees who had been camping at <LOCATION> Kitgum </LOCATION> since October. The earlier arrivals were transferred to <LOCATION> Adjumani </LOCATION>, 300 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Kampala </LOCATION>, because of fighting between <LOCATION> Ugandan </LOCATION> rebels and government forces. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said his organization is meeting <LOCATION> Ugandan </LOCATION> officials this week to determine whether the new arrivals also should be transferred to a safer location. Sudanese soldiers among the new refugees were taken to a separate camp, he said. He declined to say how many military personnel were among the refugees. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the new refugees will need 10 tons of food a day. The French government has chartered a plane to bring in food, he said.

Costello said the governor has talked with his wife every night during her stay at <LOCATION> Edgehill </LOCATION>. He has visited her every weekend. Exhaustion, stress and the letdown of the campaign loss caused Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' underlying chemical dependency to flare into episodes of excessive drinking, the governor has said.

The other reports were being checked, the army said. The army also confirmed the <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> raid but said it was investigating the circumstances. Ten Palestinians aged 15 to 30 were wounded in the legs during stoning riots that erupted in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> and four other places in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the Arab reports said. The clashes came as Palestinians shut shops, stayed home from jobs and halted public transportation in a strike called by underground leaders of the Palestinian revolt. A small bomb exploded at a soldiers' post north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. No one was injured and 20 Arabs in the area were detained for questioning, the radio said.

<HEAD>Court Turns Down Appeal by Northeastern States on Air Pollution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned away an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack downn on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states. The court, without comment, refused to order the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to limit interstate air pollution. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here said last July 22 that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> acted properly in dismissing bids by <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> officials to force federal action against pollution originating in other states. The appeals court ordered the federal agency to restudy a petition by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials in light of newly available data. Officials from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> joined those from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in asking the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn the appeals court ruling. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials did not join the appeal to the high court. The case acted on today stems from petitions filed with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1981 by <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> claiming that soot, smoke and sulfur dioxide were blowing in from hundreds of miles away. They argued that pollutants from coal-burning utility plants and factories in seven other states made it impossible for them to meet federal air quality standards. The seven states complained about are <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The northeastern states said federal law requires the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to force the other states to revise their air pollution control plans. Federal clean air laws give the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> broad power to enforce state air quality programs. If a state's program is inadequate, federal officials can order industries to clean up or face stiff fines or closing down operations. But in the case acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said there was insufficient evidence to prove that air pollution in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> originated hundreds of miles away. The agency also argued that federal law is not designed to cover such long-range pollution. The appeals court here gave deference to the agency's expertise. `` This court is being asked to second-guess the scientific judgments of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the appeals court said. `` We can not say that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assessment of the scientific evidence was unreasonable.'' The case is <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, 88-684.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left unresolved whether public school students enjoy any constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal punishment by teachers and administrators. The justices, without comment, let stand a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that allows the use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force, in the state's public schools. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law in dismissing a lawsuit filed in behalf of two kindergarten girls paddled severely for `` snickering.'' Other federal appeals courts have made it easier to win such suits. For example, the 10th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has ruled in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> case that, `` at some degree of excessiveness or cruelty,'' such punishment violates constitutional rights. The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary measures involving physical force never can amount to the `` cruel and unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment. The decision barred students from suing teachers and school administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment violations, but left them free to sue in state courts under state laws. In the 1977 decision, however, the court said it was leaving undecided whether corporal punishment ever may violate `` substantive rights under the -LRB- 14th Amendment's -RRB- due process clause.'' The case acted on today came from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where on May 6, 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cunningham </ORGANIZATION>, 5, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 6, were paddled twice _ once by their school principal and once by their teacher. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, the principal at <ORGANIZATION> Westside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kindergarten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, saw the two girls snickering in the hall, and gave each child two swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle. When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> saw them still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gave each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle. Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in their behalf said the reason for their absence was `` severe pain'' and fear over returning to school. According to court documents, both girls were taken to a child welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse. The federal lawsuit, seeking monetary damages, alleged that Ms. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and other school officials violated the girls' constitutional rights with conduct `` excessive, brutal, disproportionate to the circumstances -LRB- and -RRB- shocking to the conscience. The suit said the paddlings violated the girls' due-process and equal-protection rights. A federal trial judge threw out the suit, relying on past 5th Circuit court rulings that corporal punishment generally does not violate any constitutional rights. The 5th Circuit upheld the dismissal last Oct. 26. In seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, lawyers for the girls cited <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> studies indicating that 30,000 American schoolchildren are physically injured each year `` because of the infliction of corporal punishment to a degree that requires medical treatment.'' The appeal said those studies estimate at `` at least 100,000 children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive and inappropriate school punishment each year.'' The girls' appeal was supported in a `` friend-of-the-court'' brief submitted jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> vs. Beavers, 88-1181.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Inmate Rights on Anti-Psychotic Drugs in Washington
State Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a court hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July that convicted robber <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> must be given a court hearing before he is forced to take anti-psychotic drugs. The state court also said that prison officials must show a compelling state interest for giving <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> the medication, and show the drugs will be effective. The state's compelling interest can be demonstrated by a need to preserve life, to protect other individuals who might be harmed by <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, to prevent his suicide and to maintain `` the ethical integrity of the medical profession,'' the state court said. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was imprisoned in 1976, and for the next four years was incarcerated primarily in a mental health unit where he agreed to take anti-psychotic drugs. He was paroled in 1980 on condition he agree to receive psychiatric treatment. His parole was revoked after he attacked two nurses at <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabrini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Back in prison, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was placed in a unit for offenders with serious behavioral or mental disorders. He agreed to take anti-psychotic drugs until November 1982, when he refused to take the medication any longer. A committee of prison officials decided <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> should be given the drugs against his will, and that decision was upheld by the prison superintendent. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> filed a civil rights suit in 1985, seeking to block officials from giving him the medication and to win monetary damages for violations of his rights. A state judge dismissed the suit. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> revived it, ruling that `` competent adults have a right to determine what shall be done to their bodies.'' The state court said treatment with anti-psychotic drugs is no less intrusive than electro-shock therapy. While the drugs are beneficial to acutely ill patients, they also can have serious side effects _ ranging from involuntary spasms to permanent brain damage, the state court said. It noted that a court hearing will ensure the prisoner the right to be represented by a lawyer, to cross-examine witnesses and to examine the state's files. Such a hearing also will guarantee other due-process protections, the state court said. State officials said the state court's ruling improperly will `` insert the state and federal judicial systems into medical and institutional administrative decisions.'' The case is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, 88-599.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Demonstration in Latvia; 30 Arrests Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of police today broke up a demonstration for greater access to state-run media in the Baltic capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, tearing down banners and arresting 30 people, an activist said. Dozens of protesters gathered in front of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> to protest restrictions on Latvian state television, said <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an independent political party. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had spoken out against allowing the free access of informal groups to the television,'' <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>. Access to television is considered especially important because of the nationwide campaign before March 26 elections to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a new national assembly that is to chose the country's president and Supreme Soviet parliament. One group, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, is seeking greater autonomy for the republic. Some of its members are candidates in the election, and the group is supporting other candidates. <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body, was scheduled to meet today to discuss who should be allowed to go on television He said demonstrators had assembled outside party headquarters for a half hour before `` several hundred officers and men from the police went into the crowd. They ripped down banners and confiscated cameras. At least 30 people were arrested.'' Banners destroyed by police called for `` freedom of the press'' and `` a press without censorship,'' he said. The protesters screamed at police that they were violating the Soviet Constitution by breaking up a legal demonstration, <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> said. He said the police's action `` was unprecedented in recent months.'' In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON>, expressed alarm over rising tension in the republic, saying even the party was feeling the effects of `` ethnic stratification.'' Of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are Latvians, and 33 percent ethnic Russians. On Jan. 7, a group was formed to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists and nationalists said the new group was Russian-dominated. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the other Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> were absorbed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940, one year after the Hitler-Stalin pact consigned the area to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s sphere of influence. Political ferment has increased in the Baltic states under the liberalized atmosphere fostered by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Some residents say they want to regain their homelands' independence.

 Authorities said today at least 130 people died and 151 were critically ill after hundreds of laborers drank an illegal home-made liquor in the only Indian state where the sale of alcohol is banned. Doctors said hospitals were unable to cope with the rush of victims, and that there was little chance the most seriously injured of the 251 hospitalized victims would survive. At least 25 people were blinded by the tainted The local government announced police arrested three people who supplied the liquor. Several policemen were suspended for failing to avert the tragedy, the government said. Baroda is a major industrial center in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>, the only Indian state where it is illegal to sell alcohol. The city, 560 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, is home to 2.5 million people. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, the son of one supplier and the son of a prominent local politician were among those killed by the moonshine. The boot-leg liquor is normally a mixture of ethyl alcohol, alum and natured spirits. But this time, industrial methyl alcohol was mixed to the brew known locally as `` lattha,'' which is sold in plastic sacks for the equivalent of 10 cents. Methyl alcohol paralyzes the central nervous system. Most survivors were too ill to speak, but one told the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency the only difference he noticed was that the liquor was `` sweeter than normal.'' Press Trust said many of the victims became dizzy and complained of nausea and stomach aches before losing consciousness. A doctor at the state-run Sir <ORGANIZATION> Siyaji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which was treating most of the victims, said conditions at the facility were precarious, with groaning victims crowded against each other on the floor, on stretchers, and occasionally three to a bed. `` We do not have enough bottles of glucose to even administer first aid to the victims,'' the doctor said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There are no free stretchers to bring in more patients, because people are already sleeping on them.'' <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>'s chief minister, <PERSON> Amarsinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhary </PERSON>, ordered an investigation and promised action against the police officials who failed to avert the disaster, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The newspaper said most of the victims were poor laborers who bought the liquor Saturday morning after receiving their monthly wages. The first deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it said. As news of the deaths emerged, police fanned out across <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION> with loudspeakers blaring warnings about the liquor. About 300 people have died in seven illicit liquor cases in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> during the last decade, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. Two of the previous cases occurred in <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION>, with others reported in <LOCATION> Ahmedabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Surat </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Will Review Housing Desegregation Fines Imposed Against Yonkers
Councilmen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan. The justices said they will study arguments that the judge exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines. The case attracted national attention last summer as the defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as fines and the city faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>'s order. Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council voted last Sept. 10 to comply with Sand's order to build 1,000 low-cost homes to desegregate middle-class areas of the city. But <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, located just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had to pay $ 819,000 in fines. Each of the four councilmen was ordered to pay $ 3,500 for being in contempt of a desegregation order issued the previous Aug. 2. The case stemmed from a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit begun in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration's waning days in 1980. Sand in 1985 ruled that <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> officials intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial segregation through the city's housing and school policies. He ordered the city to desegregate the school system and build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city. City officials agreed in January 1988 to build 200 units and make plans for 600 more. They later sought to back out of the agreement. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last August said Sand acted properly in holding the city and the four councilmen in contempt after the council voted 4-3 against a package of financial incentives designed to attract development of 800 low - and moderate-income homes Sand imposed fines against the city starting at $ 100 a day and doubling daily until officials lived up to their desegregation The appeals court put a cap of $ 1 million a day on the fines, and upheld the judge's $ 500-a-day fine for each councilman. The councilmen's jail terms were blocked temporarily by a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> order last September, and the threat of imprisonment was lifted after the council relented and adopted the desegregation plan. The four councilmen are <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> and Vice Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON>. The appeals court said the four are not protected by legislative immunity against the contempt order and fines because the city government previously consented to abide by a court-approved agreement to desegregate. `` No litigant, least of all public officials sworn to uphold the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, may be permitted to avoid compliance with solemn commitments they have made in a consent judgment entered by a federal district court to remedy constitutional violations,'' the appeals court said. The 2nd Circuit court also rejected arguments that the free-speech rights of the councilmen were violated. They `` remain free to express their views on all aspects of housing in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>'' but not to violate lawful court orders, the appeals court said. The appeals court also turned back the city's argument _ in effect, one made in behalf of the city treasury and the taxpayers _ that it was powerless to compel the council members to adopt the housing desegregation plan. `` The city can not view itself as an entity separate from the city council for purposes of complying with the consent judgment'' to build the homes, the appeals court said. The justices today granted the appeals of the four councilmen but rejected an appeal filed in behalf of the city. The cases are <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-854; <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-855; <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-856; and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-870.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor who refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she could testify. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> along with three <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> employees who tried to come to her aid. Former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON> was sued by the family of <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>. She was abducted from a rooftop parking area in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on April 12, 1982, and later was shot to death along with the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Candor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was convicted of murder along with the hit man, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. The government had been investigating alleged fraud in <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON>' business Ms. <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>, an accountant there, agreed to cooperate in the investigation. Prosecutors agreed to allow her to plead guilty to one count of fraud and recommend she not serve any jail sentence. In December 1981, <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON> allegedly told <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostericher </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> and another unnamed woman working at Candor were cooperating with the government. Court papers suggested <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON> was trying to put pressure on <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON> to confess to fraud. Soon after the Schlessinger-Ostericher conversation, another former Candor employee, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Soo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, disappeared. Ms. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, a close friend of Ms. <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>, apparently was suspected by <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON> of being the other witness cooperating with prosecutors. Ms. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>'s body never was found but there was testimony that <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> displayed a photograph of her corpse to <PERSON> Margolies </PERSON> as proof he had killed her. Ms. <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> then requested police protection for herself for the second time, and <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON> again denied it. The suit against <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON> accused him of violating her rights by negligetly and recklessly denying her protection that could have saved her life. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> threw out the suit in December 1987. The appeals court said prosecutors have qualified immunity from suit when their conduct does not violate clearly established rights of individuals. `` We can not say that it was clearly established that the government had created or assumed a special relationship with <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>,'' the appeals court said. `` It would have been speculative at best to conclude that <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> was entitled to police protection or that the government was otherwise obliged to safeguard her from those against whom she was going to testify.'' Just last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> case that the government has no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private violence or abuse. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case is <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON>, 87-2034.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today left intact a $ 90,000 libel award won against six American newspapers serving Korean-American readers. The justices, without comment, turned away arguments that the newspapers should not have been legally liable for accurately reporting an announcement made by a South Korean government agency. At issue was the scope of the legal immunity a news organization enjoys when accurately and fairly reporting about government reports or public proceedings despite their defamatory nature. In the case acted on today, the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the so-called fair report privilege does not apply to reporting about acts by foreign governments. Two intelligence agencies of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government issued a 62-page `` press release'' on Sept. 9, 1985, announcing the disruption of two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> spy rings operating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The government agencies said one of the spy rings was run by students at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and identified <PERSON> Chang-Sin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as one North Korean agent. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who emigrated to this country from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in 1975 and graduated from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in 1984, now lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He recently became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> sued six newspapers and a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> television station in federal court in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, alleging that their reports libeled him by reiterating the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government's announcement. A federal trial judge threw out the suit, noting that <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law includes a fair report privilege. The judge said that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> could not win his libel suit because he could not prove the newspapers and television station acted with malice. The 4th Circuit court reinstated <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s suit last June 20, ruling that the fair report privilege should not have been invoked. The appeals court, by a 2-1 vote, said the privilege never should apply to a news organization's reporting on information received from foreign governments. `` Because we find that foreign governments are not necessarily more reliable than domestic non-official sources, we are not willing to enlarge the scope of the -LRB- fair report -RRB- privilege to include information from such governments,'' the appeals court said. It added, `` Some countries may take advantage of our liberal First Amendment rights in order maliciously to defame or, carelessly and without adequate inquiry, excoriate private parties.'' The ruling meant <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> could win his libel suit against the news organizations by proving the government report about him was false and made negligently. The ruling also cleared the way for a libel trial, in which a jury earlier this year awarded a total of $ 90,000 against the six newspapers. The television station, WNVC-TV, was found not to have libeled <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the six newspapers argued that the fair report privilege for reporting on foreign goverments sometimes should be available. The newspapers are The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, The Dong-A Iblo, <ORGANIZATION> Joong-Ang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The Sae Gae Shinbo. The case is The <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> v. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 88-1145.

<HEAD>Court Orders More Hearings in Pennsylvania Sexual Abuse Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered more hearings in the case of three <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> school officials sued by a former student who says she was sexually abused by her high school band instructor. The justices said a federal appeals court should review its ruling that the school officials sued by <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneking </PERSON>, a former student at <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, are not entitled to qualified legal immunity. The justices said the appeals court ruling should be restudied in light of their Feb. 22 decision in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> case that government has no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private abuse or violence. Whether that decision controls the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> case is not clear, however, since the lawsuit alleges that a state employee _ not a private citizen _ administered the abuse. Ms. <PERSON> Stoneking </PERSON> was graduated from high school in 1983. Her 1987 lawsuit contends that school principal <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, assistant principal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and school district superintendent <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuey </PERSON> violated her rights by failing to protect her. The suit alleges that beginning in Ms. <PERSON> Stoneking </PERSON>'s sophomore year, band instructor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sexually harassed and abused her, and forced her to engage in various sex acts with him. The suit alleges that the school officials named as defendants knew of complaints against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> involving other female students. It states that the school officials either knew or recklessly failed to discover that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was sexually abusing female band members. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was suspended in 1986, and later resigned. He pleaded guilty to criminal charges, including indecent assault, that same year. The three officials sued by Ms. <PERSON> Stoneking </PERSON> sought to have the case thrown out before reaching a trial. They said they were entitled to qualified immunity _ a legal doctrine shielding public officials from liability when their conduct `` does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'' A federal judge refused to throw out the case, and that ruling was upheld on a 2-1 vote by the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last Sept. 12. The school officials then sought help from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Stoneking </PERSON>, 88-802.

 Police opened fire today on Tibetan pro-independence protesters and reportedly killed at least four in the second day of violence in the Tibetan capital, foreign travelers said. The sound of automatic weapons fire and exploding tear gas canisters could be heard over the telephone late in the night. The reports from <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> were not immediately confirmed by official media, which reported 11 people killed in street clashes and more than 100 wounded in the Tibetan capital Sunday. Efforts to reach government officials in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> were unsuccessful. An American traveler said Tibetans put Sunday's death toll at closer to 30, but that could not be confirmed. The fighting was the fourth violent clash between Tibetans and Chinese in 18 months, and occurred on the first anniversary Sunday of one of the previous clashes. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> remains largely closed to journalists and the only independent reports came from travelers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of police reprisals. Police stationed on rooftops in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s main square fired down into crowds of Tibetans at about 5 p.m., a traveler from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview. He said he arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and was told by Tibetans that at least two people were killed. Other travelers confirmed hearing gunshots and seeing police on the roof. Another American, also speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of police reprisal, said he saw police open fire several hours later on about 40 Tibetans who were marching toward the main square. He said he did not see marchers fall, but said Tibetans told him two were killed. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that one policeman and 10 Tibetans were killed Sunday in clashes in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, while 40 police and more than 60 Tibetans were injured. Earlier today, foreign travelers in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> said police showed restraint as thousands of Tibetans marched through the streets chanting pro-independence slogans and hurling goods looted from Chinese-owned stores onto bonfires. Protesters today stoned any Chinese who tried to bicycle through the area and dragged some from their bikes, the witnesses said. At about 7 p.m., hundreds of police moved from the Chinese sector into the Tibetan part of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> on foot and in jeeps, firing occasionally, the witnesses said. About 40 stone-throwing protesters shouting `` Free Tibet!'' marched toward the city's central market soon afterward and were met by police gunfire, said one American witness. The American, coughing from tear gas, said he saw about 10 police beating three Tibetans nearby. Sunday's protest was begun by <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns who apparently were marking the anniversary of a daylong battle in which 24 people were killed. At least 40 were killed in the earlier clashes in the remote southern region. They paraded illegally through the market and were joined by several hundred people, who stoned a nearby police station. A Swedish traveler, who gave his name only as Pontus, said he ran to the roof of the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> for a better view. `` There were six people to the left of us taking pictures of the crowd ... Then they dropped their cameras and started firing with handguns into the crowd,'' Pontus said. He said no warning was given. He said he and four companions, some of whom took pictures of the shooting, had their cameras and passports confiscated. At about 3 p.m., a group of Tibetan youths carrying the banned pre-Communist Tibetan flag began north of the market, said travelers who watched from a hotel on the street. Hundreds of Tibetans joined them, but police fired tear gas and bullets, the travelers said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the protesters fired at police, and that police `` were forced to fire as no other means could stop the rioters.'' It did not make clear which side began shooting first. However, none of the nearly one dozen travelers interviewed reported seeing Tibetans with guns. `` Old people were picking up stones to give to the young people to throw,'' said one of the Americans. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims its sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> dates to the 13th century. However, many Tibetans dispute the claim and demand independence under their former spiritual and temporal leader, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. He fled to exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during a failed uprising in 1959, nine years after the region came under communist control.

<HEAD>Residents Outraged By Lenient Sentence For Convicted Rapist</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge who gave a rapist a lenient sentence because he said he did n't want to keep him from his goal of becoming a police officer has provoked outrage in this normally peaceful <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> community. Two weeks ago, Visiting Alger County Circuit Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> set aside his original verdict in the rape case and instead convicted <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> under a youthful offenders act for attacking a fellow college student. The move spared <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> jail time. He was ordered to spend three years on probation and pay $ 975 in court costs and $ 200 compensation to the victim. If he complies with the terms, his record will be expunged. His court file has been suppressed. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said he took the action partly because <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, 21, was a criminal justice major and the conviction would have prevented him from achieving his goal of becoming a police officer. The judge issued the original rape conviction Jan. 10, after a bench trial. If the judge had not revised it, <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> would have faced a minimum five-year prison sentence for two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said he will appeal the sentence. Stark's action has prompted more irate calls to the <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. Marie Evening News editorial offices than any story in recent memory, said the newspaper's editor, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazzari </PERSON>. `` I think they would lynch the judge if they had him right here,'' <PERSON> Fazzari </PERSON> said. The victim was hospitalized for emotional stress after the incident and transferred from <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to a college out of state. She said she was devastated by the lenient sentence. The state Holmes Youthful Trainee Act allows for special treatment of a defendant whose crime occurred before age 20. Stark convicted <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> Jan. 10 of two counts of rape in the Dec. 18, 1987, attack. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said he could n't convince prosecutors to consider a lesser charge that would have allowed for reduced jail time. He invoked the youthful offenders act even though <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> already was 20 years old when the rape occurred. `` This was a very unhappy choice for us,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> has left <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and is studying criminal justice at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, said his attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldenberg </PERSON>. The victim said <PERSON> Caballer </PERSON> followed her around at a small campus party and insisted on walking her back to her dormitory room at 3 a.m. When they arrived, <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> placed himself `` so that as soon as I unlocked and opened the door, he could get in.'' `` I said, ` I appreciate your walking me back here, but you're not allowed in here,''' the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted her as saying. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> then followed her into the room, forced her onto her bed and tore off her clothing, she said.

 City officials hope to close a pornographic movie house and six other theaters along a sleazy strip of West 42nd Street around the corner from Times Square by buying out their leases, according to a report published today. The conversion is part of the long-delayed plan by the city and state to clean up the crime-ridden block with office towers, arts facilities and a merchandise mart. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> said it learned that the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote March 22 on a tentative agreement in which the city would pay about $ 2 million for leases on the theaters. The city had planned to seek control of the property through condemnation proceedings because the leases have 71 years to run. But officials said that by buying out the leases, the city will get control of the theaters sooner and be able to convert them to such uses as drama and dance rehearsal halls.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today ordered a federal appeals court to consider freeing a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> city and one of its police officers from paying a $ 66,000 award over a 1981 beating death. The justices said the appeals court should restudy the case in light of their Feb. 22 decision in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> case. In that ruling, the high court said government officials have no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private violence or abuse. In the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> case, a federal jury awarded $ 66,000 to <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, whose son <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> was beaten to death at the <ORGANIZATION> Cash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on Nov. 10, 1981. The jury found that the city and Police Sergeant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> violated <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON>'s right by failing to protect him. The <ORGANIZATION> Cash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a private social club, was managed by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Pope'' Flenory, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> policeman and a friend of <LOCATION> Dlubak </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Flenory </PERSON> allegedly summoned <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> to the club to frighten <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> into confessing that <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> stole some records from the club's disc jockey. <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> tearfully pleaded with <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> to take him out of the club but the officer refused, according to court records. <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> allegedly told <PERSON> Flenory </PERSON>, `` I guess you can take care of this yourself.'' After <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> left, <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, who also was suspected in the theft of the records, were beaten severely by club employees. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> survived but <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> died. While the beatings were going on, friends of <LOCATION> Powdrill </LOCATION> arrived at the club and then went to the police station a block away to ask for help. The two officers who arrived at the club to investigate left within a few minutes, after talking to <PERSON> Flenory </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> alleged that the police department for years had failed to investigate beatings and other criminal activities at Flenory's club. She sued the city and <LOCATION> Dlubak </LOCATION> under a federal civil rights law, and the jury awarded $ 65,899 to Mrs. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which upheld the award last August, noted that <PERSON> New </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensington </PERSON> had a `` hands-off'' policy toward complaints of drunkenness at the city's private clubs. The policy said, `` When a call is received from a private club, where the complaint is intoxication, the club should be tactfully encouraged to handle its own problem. Such a club is not a public place and arrests are invalid.'' The 3rd Circuit court said <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON>'s handling of the case was in line with that policy, and therefore the city can be held liable for violating <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON>'s rights. The appeals court said city officials argued that `` although <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> could reasonably foresee serious harm befalling <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON>, he owed <PERSON> Powdrill </PERSON> no duty. We disagree.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that cities may be sued successfully in such cases when someone's rights are violated in accord with a municipal policy or custom. In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> `` did not create or exacerbate the allegedly dangerous condition. At most he can be charged with failing to exercise due care in investigating a crime, the burglary at the Cash Club.'' The city's appeal said there was no evidence <PERSON> Dlubak </PERSON> relied on the so-called hands-off policy toward private clubs when he left the matter in <LOCATION> Flenory </LOCATION>'s control. In a criminal case stemming from the incident, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVaughn </PERSON>, a disc jockey at the club, pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison. The case is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, 88-816.

 The trial of a retired librarian will hinge on whether a jury believes he was temporarily insane when he fired on children, shoppers and police officers during a seven-hour siege, killing six people. Lawyers for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, 61, planned to argue that alcohol and psychiatric problems caused him to open fire with a semiautomatic rifle, a shotgun and a revolver outside his home in the coastal community of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and at two adjacent shopping centers. Jury selection began today, with Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> convening a pool of more than 100 people from which to select a 12-member jury and several alternates. The shooting spree April 23, 1987, led to 36 felony charges that could send <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> to the electric chair: six counts of first-degree murder, 28 of attempted murder and two of kidnapping. The trial was moved 75 miles west to <LOCATION> Bartow </LOCATION> after a telephone survey suggested that many people in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> believed <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> guilty. In a videotaped interview after his arrest, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> calmly told police he believed neighbors, strangers and supermarket employees were constantly spreading rumors that he was homosexual. He said he had to stop it. `` I just wanted people to leave me alone,'' he said in the tape shown publicly for the first time Thursday during a hearing. `` I had to do something to stop them. I know I'm not queer.'' But he added, `` I was drunk and crazy and I just do n't remember hurting anyone.'' Seemingly meek, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> has a reputation as an arrogant demanding prisoner at <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, where he has been held without bond since his arrest. He quit eating at one point, claiming that jailers were trying to poison him, and he had to be force-fed through a tube in his nose for several days. Most of the time, he was kept in the jail's medical unit, not ill or suicidal, but because officers feared he might be killed by other inmates. `` He is not a very likable person,'' said Sheriff <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. A court-appointed attorney announced an insanity defense early on, and lawyers for the public defender's office now handling the case have been proceeding along those lines. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> was found competent to stand trial. Under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law, a person can be found innocent by reason of insanity if they are unaware of their actions or unable to distinguish between right and wrong at the time. Investigators have said <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> confessed shortly after his arrest. In the videotape of his interrogation, <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> acknowledged firing his guns, which he seaid he took to the shopping centers to make people stop talking about him. `` I just suppose I wanted to scare some people,'' he said. `` I hope I made an impression on them.'' Prosecutors say that after cooking dinner for his wife, <PERSON> Malahat </PERSON>, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, he left their modest home and fired on neighborhood children, wounding a teen-age boy playing basketball. As investigators later reconstructed the crime, the gunman then drove to the nearby <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> Shopping Center and opened fire, first with one weapon and then another, leaving the parking lot of a supermarket littered with bodies. Three shoppers were killed and others wounded in the first outburst. The gunman then drove across a busy highway to the <LOCATION> Sabal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> shopping center, left his car and killed the first police officer to arrive. He wounded a second policeman, reloaded his revolver and fatally shot that officer between the eyes. The gunman then moved to the another supermarket, blasted out the storefront glass and burst in, spraying the store with bullets as some 100 customers and employees ran from the store or hid. One customer was killed. He found a clerk hiding in a store restroom and took her hostage. Police closed in and tried to persuade him to surrender. After the clerk escaped, police fired tear gas and stormed the store. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> stumbled out and was captured as he tried to flee, authorities said.

 A fierce winter storm spread up to 16 inches of snow and ice from the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to the Northeast today, stranding travelers along highways and in airports. Damaging tornadoes struck in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Schools were closed by snow in six states. The weekend snowstorm developed from a cold front out of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and sent heavy snow to the southern Plains. Today, the wintry weather stretched from eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to southeastern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Severe thunderstorms along a cold front raked the Southeast with rain and golf ball-size hail and produced tornadoes that destroyed a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> motel and killed one person in a mobile home Sunday night. The bad weather also was blamed for 11 other deaths, including two children killed in an house fire in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> ignited by lighting. Heavy rain caused flooding in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The heaviest snowfall was in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where 16 inches fell in the <LOCATION> Pauls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area south of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pauls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> police chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the snow had `` drifted halfway up the door.'' Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow, the heaviest snow since a 10-inch snowfall in 1958 and the fourth heaviest on record. The Missouri State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> canceled today's session, motorists were stranded and the roofs of four businesses collapsed in <LOCATION> Noel </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>.

 A state senator vowed to have a museum official arrested and 600 people marched on the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> to protest an exhibit featuring an American flag spread on the floor. Republican Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said he will go to <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to press charges of desecrating the flag against <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, director of exhibitions and events at the art institute. <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courts were closed today for a state holiday. Veterans and relatives from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> sang patriotic songs and carried signs with such messages as `` Freedom of speech does not include desecration of the American flag'' during the demonstration Sunday. Officials closed the exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s school early, the second time in a week the controversy has closed it down. A man who tried to return to the exhibit a second time to pick up the flag and refused to leave and a woman who would not come down from a police barricade were arrested for disorderly conduct, police said. Neither <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> officials could be reached by telephone at the institute's school today. The flag is part of a work by art student `` Dread'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag?'' Besides the flag on the floor where viewers might step on it, it features photos of flag-draped coffins and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> burning the flag, and a book inviting viewer comment. The exhibit was closed to the public Feb. 24 after veterans groups complained that it was an insult and sued. The show reopened Thursday after a circuit judge ruled the exhibit is `` as much an invitation to think about the flag as it is an invitation to step on it.'' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Republican mayoral candidate <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> also attended Sunday's rally, and pledged to lobby the corporations that support the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> to reduce their financial support if the flag is not removed. <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON> and Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> want to try to cut off state funds. On Saturday, a tourist from <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, art teacher <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Willhoft </PERSON>, was arrested on a felony flag desecration charge after she stepped on the flag. Her lawyers said it was an accident. She was released Sunday on bond.

 <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON>, a Lebanese international banker, has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom, an associate reported today. However, some <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers say the 48-year-old <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> fled after a run on his bank and amid accusations he embezzled $ 200 million. Police said they know nothing about his reported disappearance. <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON>'s spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> could not be contacted by telephone. Until recently, <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> was chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s second largest bank, which is involved in a liquidity crisis with several subsidiaries, including banks in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> The associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he believes the kidnappers are acting for an individual or individuals who lost money when <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION> collapsed in December. He said he was not sure of their identities. The associate said <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> was kidnapped Feb. 19 when he went to attend a meeting in <LOCATION> Chtaura </LOCATION>, a town in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. He said a $ 1.5 million ransom was paid several days later after <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> contacted family and friends by telephone. The banker was not released, and kidnappers now have asked for $ 1.5 million more to secure his freedom, the associate said. <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> is the son of a Maronite Catholic Lebanese businessman and was educated at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He worked for a period in the 1960s for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In 1974 he set up his own investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to invest the money of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> clients. Among his better-known business moves were a bid to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was vetoed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and the successful purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>. In 1983 President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Intra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in which the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> state is a large shareholder and which, in turn, owns a large share in <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION>. Trouble started after <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired last September with no successor elected because right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies boycotted parliament. A run on Al-Mashrek deposits began in December. <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> was arrested in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> pending an investigation, but fled to Moslem-controlled west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January, where he lived in a seaside hotel until shortly before his reported kidnapping. The hotel said he checked out to stay with a friend. <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> has been feuding with central bank governor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, whom he accused of undermining <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION> to get rid of him. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> has not replied publicly. But <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahdah </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION> chairman, accused <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> of improperly transferring $ 200 million from the bank to his own companies.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remains opposed to intervening in the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, his spokesman said today as a congressional committee made plans to hold a hearing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to head off the walkout White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked by reporters whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had second thoughts about refusing to invoke the Railway Labor Act to stop the strike, said: `` We have no indication of any change.'' But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was receiving `` daily briefings'' on the situation and said <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> had met with the president on the situation Sunday night. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said today that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were pleased that the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union had not spread to other airlines and to railroads. The union called off plans for secondary picketing after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal judge ordered employees of other airlines not to honor any Machinists picket lines. `` We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has occurred,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` That's an act of responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are very appreciative.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still firmly believes that the labor dispute can best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations, rather than through direct government intervention. But the Eastern strike looms as the second major confrontation this week between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already battling over <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>'s nomination as defense secretary. The aviation subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will hold a hearing Tuesday on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s refusal to intervene hours before 8,500 striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members with support from pilots and flight attendants virtually shut down the nation's seventh largest airline <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board and order a 60-day cooling-off period that would have forestalled the strike. Administration officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not allow unions to wage `` economic blackmail.'' That decision _ which had been sought by the management of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the head of its parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> _ was the first time in the 63-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that a president has rejected its advice. Anticipating <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision, Reps. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., respectively chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its aviation subcommittee, introduced a bill last Thursday directing the president to empanel an emergency board and order the strikers back to `` I think the president got bad advice and his organization just misjudged the circumstances,'' <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said Sunday. `` Some outside force needs to be brought to bear to resolve this. The Machinists would be constrained to accept the recommendation of even a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> board.'' Instead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the administration would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw secondary boycotts in the transportation industry if Machinists put up picket lines at other airlines and railroads to cripple them as well. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the administration is opposed to congressionally imposed contract settlements. The last time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did was two years ago when track maintenance workers threatened to expand a strike against the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> railroad into a nationwide walkout. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> twice asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to outlaw secondary labor boycotts at airlines and railroads _ they already are illegal in other industries under the 1947 Taft-Hartley law _ but on both occasions, the legislation was never even considered by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Buoyed by their success in allowing fewer than 100 of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,000 scheduled flights to take place on the first day of the strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> said they would not try to spread the walkout to railroads and other airlines on Monday But they did not rule out secondary boycotts later. Meanwhile, more than 37,000 union pilots at other airlines have vowed to launch a work-to-the-rule slowdown on Tuesday in support of the Eastern Machinists. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that could `` inconvenience millions and millions of people.'' <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said Democratic congressional leaders have decided to let the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> take the lead in opposing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stance in the Eastern strike while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> maintains a second battle front on Tower. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is really waiting to see what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does; they're waiting for us to move,'' he said. Tower on Sunday repeated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as secretary of defense but said he saw no reason to do so otherwise and accused his detractors of `` hypocrisy.'' He also said he would relish a chance to appear on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor this week to defend himself, as suggested by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has not responded to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s suggestion. Appearing Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> promised `` a lot more debate,'' indicating a final confirmation vote might not come for another week. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will continue hearings Tuesday through Friday on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to bail out depositors in savings and loan associations who sought federally insured high interest rates under deregulation from now insolvent S & amp; Ls The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> last week put the 10-year cost to taxpayers of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L plan at $ 84 billion to $ 110 billion, compared to the $ 1.5 billion government stake in bailing out the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. However, unlike the federal loan guarantees that were repaid by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> when it again turned profitable, no one ever expects the government to recoup the money that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is asking taxpayers to shell out for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L depositors. Another skirmish between the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will occur Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to write a new bill to raise the minimum wage from its current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.65 over three years. The bill is identical to one proposed last year by the committee's chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., that failed last summer in the face of a Republican filibuster Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ the wife of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader _ said Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would support annual raises of 30 cents an hour to a $ 4.25 minimum wage in three years, but only if employers can keep paying new hires a sub-minimum $ 3.35 the first six months they are on their payrolls.

 People accused of driving under the influence of alcohol generally are not entitled to jury trials, a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The court, in a case from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said states are not required to hold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms are six months and other penalties are not particularly severe. The court left open the possibility the Constitution might require a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could be sentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of driving under the influence more than once. In another case, the court turned down an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states. The court, without comment, refused to order the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to limit interstate air pollution. The justices rejected an appeal by two <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> men, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON>, who said the penalties for being convicted of driving under the influence -LRB- DUI -RRB- are serious enough to warrant jury trials. Lawyers for the two said <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is one of only five states that do not permit jury trials in such cases. They listed the other states as <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. While there is mounting national concern over the seriousness of drunken driving, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said for the court Monday that <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> classifies driving under the influence as a petty crime. The demarcation line for petty crimes is a maximum sentence of six month in jail, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The fact that <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> prescribes other penalties does not raise the offense to a serious crime, he said. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> law provides that a first-time DUI offender can be sentenced to 48 hours of community work rather than jail. The offender must be dressed as a DUI offender while doing the work. The state law also imposes a maximum fine of $ 1,000, requires offenders to attend alcohol abuse edcuation courses and suspends their drivers' licenses for 90 days. Also, first-time offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in jail. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said, `` Primary emphasis must be placed on the maximum authorized period of incarceration.'' Generally, he said, `` a defendant is entitled to a jury trial whenever the offense for which he is charged carries a maximum authorized prison term of greater than six months.'' <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on July 18, 1986, and <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON> was arrested in the same town on June 29, 1986. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> has not been tried. <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON> was convicted and was sentenced to two days in jail and fined $ 310. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1987 that they were not entitled to jury trials. The state court said jury trials would place an expensive burden on the municipal court system. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan. The justices said they will study arguments that the judge exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines. _ Said federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair treatment. The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. _ Agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a court hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors. _ Barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor who refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she could testify. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> along with three <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> employees who tried to come to her aid. _ Turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities law. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> to tell readers whether companies featured in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for other services. _ Said a contract dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a computer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration. The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and a setback for <ORGANIZATION> Volt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had asked the justices to compel arbitration. The drunken-driving case is <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 87-1437.

<TEXT>
 Channel One, the widely criticized commercial television news program aimed at teen-agers in schools, debuted today in several high schools complete with ads for candy bars, dandruff shampoo and blue jeans. The 12-minute daily program is being produced by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, a Knoxville-based media company, and is being tested over the next two months in six schools around the country. The first program included coverage of the show itself and the controversy surrounding it. Before the first show was even aired a number of education groups objected to the idea of allowing advertisers to pitch their products to students in the classroom. Central High School on the north side of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> is one of the test schools and the 20 students in <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>' homeroom appeared to pay close attention to the program. The program featured stories on students' reaction to the continuing death threats against author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and life for a teen-ager in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in addition to the one on the controversy involving the launch of Channel One. Also included in the program were 30-second television ads for Snickers candy bars, Head and Shoulders shampoo, and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s 501 jeans. If the test proves successful and advertisers can be persuaded to make a long-term commitment, <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> hopes to make the program available to 8,000 or more schools in fall 1990. The program is being produced by <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, a fast-growing company that has specialized in creating magazines and sponsored posters that enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences. The audiences for its magazines, for instance, range from new mothers in doctor's waiting rooms to travel agents to high school students. Its advertiser-sponsored posters hang in offices and school lobbies. The Channel One test is expected to cost about $ 5 million. Whittle estimates the hardware alone required to take the program nationwide will cost more than $ 100 million. Each of the test schools was given about $ 50,000 worth of television monitors, video recording equipment and a satellite dish that Whittle promises to maintain. The system will be used to receive and record the show, which Whittle is producing in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and to televise it once during the school day. Included in each show are up to four 30-second commercials. In exchange for the equipment and the programming, the schools agreed to run the show once each school day in every classroom. The launching of Channel One came amid growing criticism by children's advocates and educators, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. They say such programs inappropriately thrust paid advertising messages at a captive audience in the classroom. But <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, who heads the company bearing his name, argued that someone has to pay the bill for the topical daily news program and the equipment needed to show it. He said since most schools can not afford to pick up the tab, it is reasonable to get advertisers to pay it in exchange for two minutes of commercials each day. <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said that as of late last week, eight advertisers had signed up for 80 percent of the available commercial time in the test. One of the sponsors is jeans maker <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Marketing manager <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON> said <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> was monitoring the debate about advertising and would decide after the test whether to stay with it Officials of the test schools said critics should wait until after the test is completed in late April. `` This is a program that appears to have merit and absolutely should get a chance to be seen before people make up their minds about it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsoulis </PERSON>, an assistant school superintendent in <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION> Memorial High is one of the six test schools. The others are <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Withrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gahr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kanasa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, one of the most vocal conservative voices in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said today he will not seek a third term. `` I'm here today to announce that two terms is plenty. Twelve years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seems like a good place to round it off,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said at a crowded news conference at his office in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, 48, sat on the edge of his desk and held up a large No. 2 as he announced that he will return to private life at the end of his second term in January 1991. `` I do not want to spend 18 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Republican said. `` It becomes a career at that point and I do n't believe people should make a career in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Joking, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> suggested a half-mile line of politicians would queue up at the secretary of state's office to file candidacy papers for his job. His wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, who attended the news conference with the couple's two young sons, said she had mixed feelings about the announcement. `` I'll be glad to have him home, but I think he should have run again,'' she said. `` I think he was just hitting his stride.'' Before making the announcement, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> phoned his supporters to confirm early signs that pointed to a retirement message. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> had scheduled his announcement at his office, not at a public rally where a re-election bid surely would have drawn a cheering crowd. And his campaign coffers are fairly bare, containing but $ 4,108, according to the secretary of state's office. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has maintained that no single reform would do more good than limiting senators and representatives to 12 years in either body, but he said because that is not the rule now, it was not reason enough to retire. An outspoken conservative voice in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since upsetting Democrat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> in 1978, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> has been a leader in the fights to aid Afghan guerrillas fighting Soviet troops and outlaw abortion. At last summer's Republican national convention, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> orchestrated a campaign to pressure then-nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to name a conservative running mate.

<HEAD>Will European `Pure Beef' Movement Spread to US?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A temporary truce has been declared in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade war with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but there is a gnawing worry for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef industry that all is not quiet on the home front. The question is whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers will alter their tastes as a result of the highly publicized dispute over the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on imports of hormone-treated beef. Several consumer groups suggest that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s demand for beef free of growth hormones could give a greater sense of urgency to a similar movement in this country. `` There has been a kind of slow-moving trend to meat that is free of any kind of chemical residues. But it had kind of died down as a major national issue. I think all this does is sort of add some momentum,'' says <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. A similar view is held by <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it coincides with growing concern among consumers in the way that our food is produced,'' she says. The beef industry and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government maintain there are no health or safety risks for humans from the hormones used on beef to make them gain weight quickly at a lower cost to producers. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has approved the use of growth hormones in cattle. The government tests and inspects meat and poultry for a variety of drugs, including certain hormones. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also establishes standards requiring producers to stop administering drugs to animals for a specified period before slaughter. However, industry officials are keeping a close watch on the reaction of American consumers. So far, they see no signs that the European ban has planted seeds of anxiety among red meat eaters in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I really think that by and large the focus has been on the trade aspects of it. There have been panels certifying to the safety of the hormones in question. So I do n't see that broad-based concern across the country,'' says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Copps </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, the industry was relieved when the trade dispute moved out of the headlines. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> negotiators agreed to a 75-day cooling off period to study the issue of hormone use and conduct more talks to find a permanent solution to the ban. `` We are concerned that this <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> directive and the hormone issue is somewhat of a complex trade issue that when you talk about it in simplistic terms it could be a problem and consumers could be concerned,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're very conscious of that possibility.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends the Europeans have offered no scientific evidence casting doubt on the safety of growth hormones and have implemented the beef ban as a political tactic to protect their own livestock industry and appease vocal environmental movements in their countries. `` We have the healthiest beef in the world,'' says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. `` We can not let countries impose bans that have an exclusionary effect without a medical or scientific basis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> represents a $ 100 million market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef, mostly cuts such as heart, tongue and kidneys which are not favored by American consumers. But far more is at stake in the dispute. Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, in a recent interview, expressed concern that the European beef ban could encourage a new round of global protectionism. Nations could erect new barriers to their markets by imposing restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products for alleged health reasons, such as pesticides on grain. Such actions abroad, she concedes, also could alarm American consumers. `` You can drum up an awful lot of emotion among the consumers on those sorts of ground,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. As <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> point out, there has been a simmering debate about the safety of residues in food from pesticides and from drugs administered to livestock to promote weight gain and treat disease. For example, antibiotics have been widely used as a food supplement for hogs to help them gain weight and prevent infections. Consumer demand for `` natural'' or organically grown products has already led some supermarkets to offer hormone-free beef as well as fruits and vegetables certified to be free of chemicals. <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> notes that the beef industry has responded to health concerns about fat and cholesterol by promoting lean cuts of meat. She and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> suggest that as a matter of `` consumer choice,'' hormone-free beef could find its way on more shopping lists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is a much greater public sensitivity to health. People are looking more carefully at their diet than they did 10 years ago or 20 years ago,'' says <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>. `` These questions of what we add to foods and the reason we need to add chemicals to foods need to be re-evaluated and I think that's what is happening.

 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will begin regular airline service between their countries for the first time since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was founded, a spokesman for the Polish airline LOT said Monday. LOT this month starts once-a-week flights to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, while the Israeli carrier <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> will expand from charters to scheduled service, said LOT spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojdyllo </PERSON>.

 An Army warrant officer admitted at the opening of his court-martial today that he was involved in a five-year conspiracy to provide classified military information to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to all 10 counts of espionage, attempted espionage and failing to obey Army regulations that were lodged against him after his arrest last December in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, the military judge presiding at the court martial at <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> here, did not immediately accept <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s guilty plea Under Army regulations, he will hear the prosecution's case against <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and defense witnesses before deciding <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s guilt and punishment Court officials said <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>' final verdict and sentence probably will not come before Friday. Under a defense-initiated pre-trial agreement disclosed during the court martial today, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> pleaded guilty to all charges against him in exchange for the government agreeing not to seek the death penalty. The rest of the government's agreement on a sentence for <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was not disclosed, including the maximum sentence Hall will receive. Under Army procedures, <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> will not see the sentencing agreement until after he pronounces sentence on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, and if his sentence is more severe than the agreement, the agreement will prevail. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s civilian attorney, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> would not `` comment at any time now or in the future.'' `` He has authorized me to inform you that he is truly sorry for whatever damage he may have done to national security and to tell you that he has taken every imaginable step to now minimize thgat damage,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in a statement. `` His family was totally uninvolved and unaware of his activities and Hall will spend the remainder of his life working to prove that he eventually deserves to be reunited with his wife and children,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> intends to tell <ORGANIZATION> Eggers </ORGANIZATION>, during the closed portion of his court-martial, `` all the actions he has taken to neutralize this situatiuon and then throw himself on the mercy of the military judge.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said through a military spokesman that the defense would have no comment on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s motivation for passing classified information to representatives of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> until after he is questioned by <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>.

 Two commuter trains collided today outside <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION> said two people were killed and 44 injured. It was the second rail collision in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 48 hours. A crash Saturday on the outskirts of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> killed five people and injured 94. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a spokesman for state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION>, said one person was believed trapped in the wreckage two hours after the accident, and most injuries were believed minor. <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION> said the two trains were traveling in opposite directions between the <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Springburn </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milngavie </PERSON> when they collided just before 1 p.m. outside <LOCATION> Bellgrove </LOCATION> station, two miles from the center of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>. `` We were all sitting down in the train, and suddenly there was a large bang. People were thrown about all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a student who was on one train. `` I helped drag one old woman out. She was covered in blood and eventually taken to hospital,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> McVey </PERSON>, who had been walking his dog near the tracks. The two trains, carrying about 70 passengers, were going less than 30 mph, <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION> said. At least two cars derailed. Firefighters swarmed over the wreckage to free trapped passengers, while ambulances stood by to evacuate casualties. <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION> is a branch of state-owned <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>, whose safety procedures are under severe criticism following two serious accidents in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> area in less than three months. The Scottish crash `` confirms ... that we have been putting insufficient resources into preventing these accidents,'' said legislator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman. `` The government's policy is clearly on trial,'' he said. Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> denied that government budget-cutting was a factor, but told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>: `` The fact that there have been two serious accidents on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and now a third within three months is naturally a cause for concern.'' After Saturday's crash outside <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, investigators found signs the driver of one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal before his train struck another London-bound train. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday that driver <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> made `` a severe brake application'' long before his train passed the red signal. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was one of 94 people injured when his train, traveling from <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, hit a train traveling from <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION> to the capital. Police said today that 31 people remained hospitalized, 10 in serious condition. Six cars rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash, and several came to rest in the yards of homes. Authorities said the <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION> train was crossing from a slow track onto the main line when it was struck from behind near <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> `` has told us that the signal at the end of the platform at <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> was red, yet he went through it,'' <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said. `` He has not been able to offer any explanation for that.'' <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> was hospitalized with two broken legs, <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said. `` The safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on drivers stopping at red lights,'' he said. `` We have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application was made prior to the collision and long before the signal,'' <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said. He did not detail the evidence. The possibility of driver error `` is not uppermost in my mind at the moment, though it is obviously a main area of inquiry,'' he said. <PERSON> Pettitt </PERSON> said the train's braking system was being examined. He said there was no evidence of sabotage and the signaling equipment at <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> appeared to be working properly. Three trains crashed near a busy south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> junction during rush hour Dec. 12, killing 35 people. Railway officials believe a malfunctioning signal caused that crash.

An attempt to ease tensions by telephoning <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> on the air foundered embarrassingly when the connection was lost, and <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> and co-host <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> were forced to ad-lib through the show's final moments. `` A very unusual Monday _ in many ways best forgot,'' said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. It all started last week, when someone leaked to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> a memo <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> had written to `` Today'' producer <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>.

The harshest words were reserved for <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s hokey, homey shtick, including his endless recitations of centenarians' birthdays. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> at first made light of the memo, but later said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s comments were hurtful and hinted he might leave `` If it's not real, and if there is n't an honest, genuine reconciliation, I do n't think I belong there,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Exit <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shalit </PERSON>, on vacation. Enter <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. `` Good to be back after what should have been a quiet vacation,'' said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> at the top of Monday's show. `` The fact that it was n't is something we'll get into a little bit later, but first things first. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> welcomed him back. `` You were never far from our thoughts,'' she said wryly. Later on, <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> thanked callers for expressions of support, saying `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> and I are very grateful.'' `` We do appreciate your concern, and despite what you may have heard or read in recent days, we are together and hopefully we're going to be with you for many years to come,'' said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> `` Now that may come as sad news for those who have tried to capitalize on our differences, but rest assured, that ` Today' family is intact and still smiling, albeit through some pain,'' he continued. `` ` We'll still be here long after the recent headlines are forgotten. Enough said.'' Of course, it is not possible to say enough about the `` Today'' imbroglio. Midway through the show, <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> managed a crack after a news story about secret government documents found in discarded safe. `` You've got to be careful where you put documents these days,'' said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, to peals of laughter. Then, at the show's end, came the phone-call fiasco. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> said he intended to talk with <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> `` about vacation plans and onto some other things.'' He said he had talked to Scott several times since Saturday and before the show. `` This was going to be our little surprise before going off,'' <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> said, and he wished <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> happy birthday. Tuesday is <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s birthday. His 55th, not his 100th.

 Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> suspended a state prison-release program after an inmate who was in prison for beating his ex-wife was charged with killing her while on an eight-hour pass. `` Clearly, mistakes were made, there's no doubt about that, and I'm good and mad about it,'' <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said. `` I understand proper procedures were not followed, and we're going to find out why that happened, discipline those who were involved, re-evaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense,'' <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nation </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>'s press secretary, said no inmate involved in the furlough program will receive a pass for the next four weeks while corrections officials review the policy and report to the governor. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, was charged with murdering his ex-wife, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, 29, on Saturday in this town near the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state line, authorities said. He was being held Sunday at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, who was serving an eight-year sentence for beating <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> two years ago, had been in a work-release prisoner at the camplike Correctional Industrial Complex. Prison officials said he was released into his mother's custody Saturday morning. The pass was supposed to limit his travel to the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area, 40 miles southwest of the prison, but <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> instead went to <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, authorities said. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was arrested Saturday afternoon after neighbors reported seeing <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> bludgeoned in the head with the butt of a shotgun, police Capt. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Deal </PERSON> said. `` There were several witnesses,'' said police Cpl. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>. `` It's kind of the low-rent district, so nobody probably wanted to get involved ... There's a lot of elderly people.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, superintendent of the light-medium-security correctional complex, said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was eligible for a 48-hour pass. Correction officials made his first pass shorter to gradually expose him to freedom and to ensure he could handle it, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said that as he understood the situation, `` if proper procedures had been followed, the victim would have been notified, and in this particular instance that was not done.'' State policy requires such notification only if the crime victims request it, said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON>, supervisor of work-release services for the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>. He said he did not know if <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> had made such a request. Nation said the furlough program, one of three in which inmates are allowed limited freedom, was in effect when <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, a Democrat, took office earlier this year. Inmates also can receive work release and `` special assignment'' to interfaith housing. `` We are going to re-evaluate this program because we're not convinced that it is a program that serves the best interests of the department or the people of the state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>,'' Nation said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made prison furloughs allowed by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the focus of a soft-on-crime attack on his Democratic rival in the 1988 campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited the case of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisoner who bludgeoned a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> couple, raping the woman, after escaping during a weekend furlough. The federal government has a prison furlough program, also, but only for prisoners within two years of their release date.

<HEAD>Private Group Urges More Federal Money for Climate Research</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of scientists concerned about threatened changes in the Earth's climate called Monday for more federal spending on research. `` Given the enormous momentum in the Earth's climate system, we delay response actions at our peril,'' said the report from the <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private group which seeks to coordinate interests of public and private researchers and officials. A committee convened by the institute recommended approval of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed $ 190.5 million request for global change research, plus federal support totaling about $ 170 million for a series of additional efforts. The panel cited the recent series of unusually warm years, which some believe are a result of a greenhouse effect on Earth's environment `` If this strong warming trend is, as some very credible scientists believe, the beginning of a significant and rapid greenhouse warming, humanity may soon be faced with some vexing challenges,'' the committee concluded. The greenhouse theory contends that increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are causing the planet's climate to warm up, by trapping the sun's heat in somewhat the way a greenhouse traps heat inside Scientists disagree over whether the recent warm years are the result of normal variations in climate or the first signs of a greenhouse effect. If the warming turns out to be a trend, it could pose such problems as changes in the regions where agriculture succeeds, relocation of forests, melting of polar ice and raising sea levels, stronger hurricanes and other weather and climate changes. `` Unfortunately, the nations of the world are woefully short of a clear understanding of fundamental processes at work in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere,'' reported the committee headed by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mitre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Among the projects that the committee urged, in addition to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget recommendations for climate research, were: _ A $ 14 million program to accelerate the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals blamed for damaging the protective ozone layer and which also add to the greenhouse warming _ Studies of the impact of sea-level rise, totaling $ 25 million _ Some $ 1.5 million for health impact studies _ Upgrading the volunteer weather network and setting up regional climate centers, $ 12.2 million _ A $ 14 million national greenhouse gas monitoring system _ <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> research on global change totaling $ 17 million _ Some $ 21 million for international studies of climate warming impact _ A $ 20 million <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> program for climate research in the Third World

 Four-time Iditarod champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> was the first sled-dog racer to reach the highest checkpoint in the grueling race as leading mushers made their way through the rugged <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION> early today. <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, driving 18 dogs through the darkness, arrived at <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> checkpoint at 5 a.m. He was followed four minutes later by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nenana </LOCATION>. Three-time champion <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> arrived at 5:22, and <PERSON> DeeDee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonrow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> arrived four minutes later. The weather plagued mushers early today. In some spots, wind had blown the trail clean of snow and the ice underneath was wearing the dogs' feet. None of the four leaders has taken the 24-hour layover required during the race. Three other mushers were on the trail from <LOCATION> Finger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rainy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, which is 226 miles into the race and at 3,400 feet elevation. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buser </PERSON>, who was out front when the first mushers pulled into Finger Lake late Sunday, declared his 24-hour layover and had not moved by early today. Under the rules of the race, mushers are required to make a 24-hour stop at one of the race's 24 checkpoints; at the others, they take whatever length of rest they believe they and the dogs need. However, mushers are allowed to use the strategy of declaring a 24-hour layover, then leaving after a couple of hours, in hopes of getting a jump on their competitors. The 1,168-mile race began Saturday when 49 mushers left <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> amid 46 mph gusts and a wind-chill reading of 22 degrees below zero. Two mushers, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Masek </PERSON>, dropped out 151 miles into the race. From Rainy Pass, the mushers have 942 miles to go before reaching the finish on <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>'s historic Front Street. The trail out of Rainy Pass contains dangerous dogleg descents on icy trails clinging to steep embankments. Several mushers complained that parts of trail were difficult to navigate. <PERSON> Reddington </PERSON> said getting over a bluff past the <LOCATION> Yentna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was virtually impossible. `` You need an elevator to get over that one,'' said <PERSON> Reddington </PERSON>, who injured his two rear dogs Sunday when his sled crashed into them and opted to take a 24-hour layover at <LOCATION> Finger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. Inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> for a diphtheria outbreak in 1925, the Iditarod was founded in 1973. The winner this year is to get $ 50,000 of the $ 250,000 purse. The remainder is shared by the next 19 finishers. Most of the Iditarod mushers are from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Others are from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Newcomers Want Town Clock Silenced At Night</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HATFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The clock in the <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has sounded the hours, day and night, for most of two centuries. Now, a couple new in town has asked selectmen to turn it off at night so they can sleep. This little farming town of 3,000 people is not so sure it wants to give up the tradition. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON> said Monday that he and his wife moved from <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> to a home next door to the church this summer while the clock was broken and the chimes did n't sound. `` It's not just loud. At midnight it rings 12 times and at five in the morning it rings five times,'' <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON> said. `` We're about 40 feet away and it's as loud as a car pulling into the driveway.'' But <PERSON> Carnall </PERSON> said before a Monday night public hearing that he has gotten mixed reactions to his proposal to silence the bells between midnight and 6 a.m. `` Those bells have been ringing for about 200 years and I do n't think too many people want them changed,'' said <PERSON> Selectman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, adding that town officials got an earful from residents during the months the bells did n't ring Although the clock is in the church, built in 1668, the town has been maintaining it for more than a century. `` You get used to it,'' said <PERSON> Selectman </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zgrodnik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has lived across the street from the clock for most of his 47 years. For years, he said, it was the only way his father and other farmers had of knowing the time when they were working in the fields. `` I remember my folks would tell me to be home at a certain time and, like most kids, running like hell when I heard the clock in hopes I'd get home before the chimes stopped,'' <PERSON> Zgrodnik </PERSON> said. `` It's sort of comforting to hear,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>. `` Most people in town that I've talked to feel its no different from moving in next door to <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and asking that it be shut off at night. And they do n't much like people coming in and upsetting their applecart,'' <PERSON> Zgrodnik </PERSON> said. `` One fellow told me that if we do agree to shut down the clock, we'd better be prepared to move the town dump, because he does n't like having that near his house.''

<HEAD>Oil Transfer Halted Amid Rough Seas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rough seas forced crews to suspend work early today on removing the remainder of the 90,000 barrels of crude oil left aboard a damaged tanker that spilled 33,000 gallons of oil last week. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said crews stopped work shortly after midnight, and would decide later today when to resume pumping what is left of the 3.7 million gallons of oil from the 800-foot <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> to its sister ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorktown </ORGANIZATION>, in waters 14 miles off <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Less than 10 percent of the oil remained aboard the damaged ship when the transfer was suspended, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said. Once the oil is abord the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorktown </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> can decide what to do with the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, which was torn from its offshore mooring buoy in rough seas and high winds Thursday while unloading crude oil, said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chassin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The stormy weather drove the ship aground on a coral reef about 1,500 yards off a little-used shoreline about 15 miles from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and its famed <LOCATION> Waikiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Cleanup crews spent their third day removing oil from a two-mile stretch of coastline Sunday. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said there were no reports of birds or marine life being harmed by the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said the company will spend whatever is needed to clean the beaches and ocean Despite the wind and seas, the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> was within safety standards for unloading its cargo of <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slope </ORGANIZATION> crude oil at the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaiian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refinery </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said. About 25,200 gallons of crude oil spilled when floating hoses at the mooring buoy separated, and about 8,400 gallons of fuel oil spilled from a ruptured tank when the ship ran aground, according to revised estimates Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials. Earlier estimates were that 117,000 gallons of oil had spilled. The tanker floated free of the reef on the rising tide Friday night after its ballast water was pumped out.

 Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions taken Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. DRUNKEN DRIVING People accused of driving under the influence of alcohol generally are not entitled to jury trials, a unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The court, in a case from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, said states are not required to hold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms are six months and other penalties are not particularly severe. The court left open the possibility the Constitution might require a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could be sentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of driving under the influence more than once. The case is <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 87-1437. ACID RAIN The court turned down an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states. The court, without comment, refused to order the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to take steps to limit interstate air pollution. The case is <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, 88-684. <LOCATION> YONKERS </LOCATION> DESEGREGATION The court agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan. The justices said they will study arguments that the judge exceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines. The cases are <PERSON> Spallone </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-854; <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-855; <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-856; and <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-870. FEDERAL WORKERS The court said federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair treatment. The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, 87-636. PRISON INMATES The court agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a court hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors. The case is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, 88-599. POLICE PROTECTION The court barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor who refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she could testify. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> along with three <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> employees who tried to come to her aid. The case is <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Schlessinger </PERSON>, 87-2034. FREE SPEECH The court turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities law. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> to tell readers whether companies featured in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for other services. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-982. ARBITRATION The court said a contract dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a computer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration. The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and a setback for <ORGANIZATION> Volt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had asked the justices to compel arbitration. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Volt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Informational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1318. MINORITIES The court today reinstated a challenge to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> affirmative action plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned by women or minorities in building a rail transit system. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ordered a lower court to reconsider its dismissal of the challenge in light of their Jan. 23 decision striking down a similar affirmative action `` set aside'' program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The case is <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> vs. Metropolitan <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 87-1001. AGE BIAS The court, in a case stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, today refused to let <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over 60. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is bound by an age bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against Western. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Criswell </PERSON>, 88-1138. CORPORAL PUNISHMENT The court left unresolved whether public school students enjoy any constitutional protection against paddling or other corporal punishment by teachers and administrators. The justices, without comment, let stand a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that allows the use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force, in the state's public schools. The case is <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> vs. Beavers, 88-1181.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crocodile </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION> was promoted Monday to three-star status in the <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> guide, giving owner-chef <PERSON> Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jung </PERSON> the ultimate accolade in French gastronomy. His was the only restaurant to be raised to the highest level in the Michelin galaxy, which this year lists only 19 three-star restaurants in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The red <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION>, known to gourmets the world over as the `` bible of gastronomy,'' awards three stars only to those restaurants with `` exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey.'' Four two-star restaurants lost one or both stars this time, including the <LOCATION> Beau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rivage </LOCATION> in Condrieu near <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, which went from two stars to one; the Chantecler at the <ORGANIZATION> Negresco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped a star; the Cote d'Or at <ORGANIZATION> Nuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burgundy </LOCATION> which lost both its stars and Point in <LOCATION> Vienne </LOCATION> which disappeared from the guidebook. Twelve famous <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> restaurants lost their sole star, including <ORGANIZATION> Chez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anges </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamberge </PERSON> and Olympe. `` I was suprised and thrilled,'' said <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocodile </PERSON>'s 47-year-old chef in a telephone interview from his restaurant in <LOCATION> Alsace </LOCATION>. `` Of course, I've been aiming for the highest quality for years. I'm constantly giving myself grades, not always awfully high. `` His food is superbly creative, with a strong basis in the local produce and traditions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Naegellen </PERSON>. Outstanding dishes include fresh `` sandre,'' a kind of pike cooked with juniper berries, with a delicate stuffing of sauerkraut, an Alsatian specialty. The first course jellied consomme with foie gras dice, another Alsatian specialty, is presented in a crown shape with a puree of leeks and potatoes in the center. `` <PERSON> Jung </PERSON>'s cellar is fabulous, not only in Alsatian wines but in wines from all over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the whole world, which is very rare,'' said <PERSON> Naegellen </PERSON>. Celebrating its 80th anniversary _ it did not publish for nine years during the two world wars _ the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> guide is accompanied by a quaint facsimile of the original 1900 little red book. In those days, the book was aimed not at gastronomes but at pioneers whose `` tin lizzies'' were subject to frequent breakdowns. Today, the guide bases its choices on good food on the many visits by anonymous inspectors, and it is considered the most serious hotel and restaurant guide in a country obsessed with food and wine. Last year, 720,000 copies were snapped up by drivers and epicures. `` The little free booklet was offered to buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> tires and was aimed at helping drivers change a tire, repair their cars or find garages,'' said <PERSON> Naegellen </PERSON>. There were no restaurants listed then, only hotels with restaurants in cities other than <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` The guide was aimed at drivers going from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the provinces,'' said <PERSON> Naegellen </PERSON>. The top grade of three stars signaled the most expensive hotels offering rooms with relative luxury, such as electricity, including all meals with wine. It also indicated the eventual presence of a doctor or pharmacy in every town, no matter how small. This information was vital in days when drivers needed more than a week to get from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to the south of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The legendary <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> stars, which look like rosettes, were first awarded for gastronomy in 1926. They now are the ultimate in prestige for restaurants, and the 1989 guide lists 619 starred establishments. Among this year's demotions, Olympe's fall from one-star grace is particularly disappointing to those who root for women chefs.

<HEAD>Pravda Attacks Superministry of Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda Monday joined other Soviets criticizing the ministry in charge of agriculture, reprinting citizen comment that it is ineffective and useless. Commonly known as `` Gosagroprom,'' the governmental committee that oversees the agencies that run the nation's state-owned and collective farms has recently been broadly criticized in the press. Rumors swept <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership is planning to abolish the committee, which was formed under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985 when five agricultural ministries and some other state agencies were merged. The party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet this month and is expected to make reforms in agriculture to remedy chronic food shortages. An article published in Pravda on Monday said the paperwork produced by <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON> indicates the ministry is n't overlooking serious problems, but that a closer look reveals `` it's possible to say it did not solve any big problems.'' People attending a party conference in <LOCATION> Kharkov </LOCATION>, a Ukrainian city 400 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, wrote a letter to the Supreme Soviet parliament calling for the dismantling of `` this monopolistic, ineffective, bureaucratic organization'' that hinders effective forms of farming, the article said. Pravda said <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON> has made certain the farmer's dream of living as well as non-farmers who work in food processing remains just a dream. The most common words to Gosagroprom from farmers are: `` Give us resourses, and do n't bother our work,'' Pravda said. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> also printed an article Monday by a doctor of economic sciences, <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzdalov </PERSON>, that indicated there is consensus at least on the need to drastically cut back the size of <LOCATION> Gosagroprom </LOCATION>, starting with the regional organizations responsible for agriculture, known to the Soviets by the Russian-language acronym of RAPOs. `` The judgment on whether <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON>, starting with <ORGANIZATION> RAPO </ORGANIZATION>, is necessary in its present form is no longer subject to debate, it seems,'' the economist wrote. The Politburo published a report Saturday saying it supported the creation of various types of farms to help alleviate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s food shortage. The 12-member ruling body made no direct reference to abolishing <PERSON> Gosagroprom </PERSON>, but said new forms and methods of management were needed in the country's agricultural management. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has announced it will hold a plenum March 15-16.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> retiree who helped fly weapons to the Contras described today how an associate of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s pulled him into the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms initiative North co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> `` asked me to assist in the transportation of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. In January 1986, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, `` I was told they desired to move classified cargo from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, he said, `` asked if I could arrange that.'' `` You must figure this out,'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told him. `` You must convince <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> to do the job. This could lead to the release of the hostages.'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> handled the covert program to ship arms to the Contras in early 1986, when that was illegal, and ran flights with humanitarian aid when that became legal. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> also testified how <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> decided that one of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s companies should get title to the aircraft being used to secretly supply the Contras. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that `` I objected somewhat strenuously'' when <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s co-defendants in the Iran-Contra case, summoned him to a meeting in January 1986 at a <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, restaurant. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> announced that he had `` changed his mind'' and that one of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s companies would get title to the aircraft rather than a company <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> controlled. After <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> complained, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> called North aside, the two spoke briefly, returned to the table and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> `` told me that is how it would be. Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> seemed to agree,'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified. The C-7 Caribou aircraft had been purchased with funds generated by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s secret resupply operation to the Contras. Eventually, the Contra leadership `` felt the planes belonged to them,'' related <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, who described how <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> held another discussion about ownership during a plane trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` North agreed'' once again that the planes belonged to one of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s companies, <ORGANIZATION> Udall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and that the `` Contras did not exercise total control,'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 as a lieutenant colonel, also described <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s involvement in other details of the Contra resuply operation. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said a crewmen, <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, described `` what went wrong and what went right'' with an airdrop of military supplies to the Contras in southern Nicaraguan near the Costa Rican border in April 1986. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> also said that he billed one of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s companies, <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, $ 392,000 for construction of an airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> that was designed to help supply the Contras on the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> enlisted him to help build the airstrip for secret military supply missions to the Nicaraguan Contras while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels. Among the 12 criminal charges against North are four counts of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying his involvement in the Contra resupply operation. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified Thursday that <PERSON> North </PERSON> enlisted him to help build a secret airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to support a `` southern front'' for the Contras in their guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> described how he was summoned on a Sunday by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide, who pointed on a map to a remote section of the country's west coast. `` <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> asked if I could build'' the airstrip, recalled <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>. `` Not being in the business of building airfields,'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, he retained some consultants and eventually the runway was built. North at one point accompanied <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> to a meeting with Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duemling </PERSON> and urged him to award <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> an air delivery contract to help distribute $ 27 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Duemling </PERSON> agreed to the request. One of the government's key witnesses against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, was sentenced Friday for his role in the Iran-Contra affair and is to be called later by the prosecution.

<HEAD>Pro-Government Newspaper Calls for Botha to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pro-government newspaper known for its staunch support of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> joined other leading publications that called Monday for the resignation of the ailing leader. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, is recovering from a stroke suffered Jan. 18, but he announced last week that he will return to office in April and plans to remain at least until his term expires in September. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who has been head of government for more than 10 years, left open the possibility he may seek another five-year term as president. `` There is a time to come and there is a time to go,'' said the pro-government daily <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> in an editorial, quoting the words of D.F. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a prime minister in the 1940s and 1950s and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s political mentor `` May we suggest that -LRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> -RRB- again reads these words attentively,'' the editorial said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>'s -RRB- voice from the far past still has much to say to us all.'' There had been speculation <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would return to office only long enough to step down with dignity and ceremony, making way for Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the heir apparent as president. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was elected leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last month after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned from that post. Traditionally, the party leader has been head of government, and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has found himself in an awkward position because he has no formal power over government decision-making. The government-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the country had been `` reinvigorated'' by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s initial speeches since becoming head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The lengthy editorial made no mention of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s calls for race reform had drawn an `` enthusiastic response'' from opposition groups that have refused previously to negotiate with the government. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has yet to declare any major policy differences with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic, and thus more capable of breaking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political stalemate. He has made vague proposals to soften the impact of existing segregation laws. Several leading newspaper in recent days have predicted a power struggle in the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> if <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> attempts to remain in charge. `` There is now a strong possibility that after the meetings of ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- organizations this week, a delegation could be sent to Mr. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to ask him to stand down,'' the independent Star newspaper, the country's largest selling daily, said in a front-page story. Calls from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s resignation have come from liberal and far-right opposition parties, as well as from some <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. `` <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, unable to relinquish high office gracefully, has put himself into an untenable position,'' said Business Day, the leading financial daily. `` Nobody in his personal entourage is likely to tell him ... he is the most disliked leader the -LRB- National -RRB- Party has ever had.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting president, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 An attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that bank law-enforcement efforts could suffer because a federal appeals court vacated a board order that had barred a former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from the banking business. `` It creates a certain problem when someone can resign and therefore elude jurisdiction,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, an attorney for the board. In January 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> removed <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> as officer and director of the Detroit-area bank-holding company and barred him from engaging in banking activities. However, in July 1984, <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON> had resigned as head of the bank, leaving the company nearly a year before the comptroller of the currency began steps toward removing him. The comptroller, recommending action against <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, said the bank officer used some of the institution's funds for improper purposes. Saying `` one can not remove what is n't there,'' a federal appeals court here, in a ruling Friday, vacated the board's order and agreed to review the case. The board had argued that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the removal provision as a way of barring people who engaged in midconduct from returning to the banking business. `` It is not an uncommon occurrence for someone who has been suspected or accused of misconduct to resign voluntarily or to resign as a result of pressure from his institution,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, said his client `` seriously wants to get back into the banking business.'' `` In the current climate of troubled institutions all over the country, someone of his enormous experience and talents would be quite useful to any number of institutions,'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> today called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to abandon the so-called <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> <PERSON> Doctrine </PERSON> used to justify military intervention to block reforms in communist countries. In his first speech to an international forum, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also announced that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is exploring ways to accelerate the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had enormous stocks of such weapons threatening <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and called on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in mutual destruction of `` these frightening weapons.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> Sunday night to advise him of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plans on chemical weapons, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decided to withdraw the weapons ahead of the 1992 deadline agreed to previously, but <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made no mention of such a reported decision in a later statement. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> applauded what he called a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pledge to explore possibilities for the early removal of chemical weapons from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the government press office said the discrepancy between <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s and Ost's statements could not be immediately explained. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke at a meeting of 35 foreign ministers gathered in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hofburg </LOCATION> palace to launch talks on reducing conventional weapons across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a largely conciliatory speech, he urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to put into practical use the `` new thinking'' guiding Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s foreign and domestic policies. `` New thinking and the <LOCATION> Brezhnev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doctrine </LOCATION> are in fundamental conflict,'' he said. `` We call today upon General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to renounce the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> _ beyond any shadow of a doubt,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told his fellow ministers that all Europeans should have the freedom `` to have a say in decisions which affect their lives'' and to express their political differences, as well as the freedom `` to be safe from military intimidation or attack.'' `` Those in the East,'' he said, `` should be free of the fear that armed Soviet intervention, justified by the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, would be used again to deny them choice.'' The doctrine, named for the late Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, was invoked by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to justify the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to crush the liberal communist reforms of then party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s speech made favorable references to the change <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has instituted. `` The rhetoric of Soviet foreign policy is being reshaped with less emphasis on the use of force,'' he said. At another point, he said that as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> approaches the end of the decade, `` new horizons are beckoning'' and that `` realism has begun to triumph in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> began his three-day visit to the Austrian capital on Sunday with meetings with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, setting a signal that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to encourage those countries' increasing political and economic reform. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in his speech that `` people want freedom, freedom of the mind, freedom in the home'' behind what has become `` a rusting Iron Curtain.'' He said while the East should be free of the prospect of Soviet intervention, those in the West should be free of the fear of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces pointed in their direction. `` We shall never be able to set <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> relations on an irreversible course toward enduring improvement unless we deal with the huge conventional military imbalance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer in December to withdraw six tank divisions and 50,000 men from eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` a very good start.'' But even after such a pullout, he said, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would retain a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> would propose once the negotiations begin Thursday an overall limit of 40,000 tanks among the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. However, he said, `` change in the military balance is only one part of the process. Only when the causes of the historic division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have been removed ... will it be possible to eliminate the military confrontation.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared today that he is `` sick and tired of the rumors and innuendos'' blocking <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as defense secretary Using the beginning of a speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience to get something `` off my chest,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demanded that members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` put aside partisanship'' and approve Tower's nomination `` I've asked them to use their own experience with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as an expert on defense issues, as a former colleague and as a tough hard-nosed negotiator to guide them as they move towards a vote on this nomination,'' the president said. With the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> preparing to resume debate at midday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator `` a fellow veteran, a lifelong public servant'' and `` a fighter.'' Tower was not present for the speech, although the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had said he would be. Officials said later that Tower had had a previous commitment. `` I stand by this man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his wildly cheering audience today. `` I stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the right man to take charge of the Pentagon. ... `` `` Enough for that now,'' the president said. `` Going to get it off my chest. I'm getting sick and tired of some of the rumors and the innuendo that are used against this decent man.'' As debate resumed on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, Republican Whip Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> labeled the accusations against Tower as `` so obviously flimsy,'' and urged his colleagues not to base their decision on such information. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is a scrapper,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` I would never walk away from innuendo and petty people and goofy witnesses trying to bring me down.'' Earlier today, White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reiterated that administration officials are not searching for a substitute nominee and plan to carry the Tower fight all the way to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor vote. `` We are n't thinking of fallback positions,'' he told reporters. `` We're supporting the candidacy of Senator Tower.'' Tower said Sunday that his `` excessive drinking'' in the past does not indicate any long-term problem and he would welcome the chance to defend his nomination on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. Appearing on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Face the Nation,'' <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he would not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn, arguing that the dispute over his selection has escalated beyond consideration of his qualifications. The former senator repeated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmed as defense secretary, and he accused his detractors of hypocrisy. Tower sought to deflect the most common criticism against him by drawing a distinction between the past heavy drinking he has acknowledged and an alcohol `` abuse'' problem that would disqualify him from sensitive military positions. `` I still have sip of wine now and again,'' Tower responded when asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to do so if confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once confirmed, I will give it up altogether.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., has said Tower would fail to qualify for a sensitive military position because of his history of drinking Tower denied that, and said `` I would be disqualified if you could prove alcohol dependency or chronic alcoholism. ... In the final analysis, it is a decision to be made by the commanding officer that should be based on hard evidence. In my particular instance, the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the commanding officer. `` The fact is I am not alcohol-dependent,'' Tower said. `` There is no conclusive proof to the effect. As a matter of fact, the weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise. `` I've admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s,'' Tower said. `` I've said excessive drinking, not alcohol abuse. ... There's a difference.'' Tower said he would relish a chance to appear on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to defend himself, as suggested by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. The full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must approve before a non-member can address the chamber. Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has not said how he would react to such a move. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, appearing on the ABCTV program, `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' vowed `` to fight this to the end.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the best-suited man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said so, and he has the right to make the nomination because he won the election,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. The Tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the outset of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-9 against Tower on Feb. 23, splitting on partisan lines with Democrats in favor and Republicans against. Democrats, led by <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, say they are troubled by reports of Tower's excessive drinking, extramarital affairs and his ties to defense and aerospace contractors. One Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said on CNN that although many of the accusations against Tower had proved untrue, he decided to vote against the nomination because `` it's risky to have someone with his background and the problems he has had in that office.'' Tower said that the real issue is politics, not his personalit. `` Senators are quite capable of changing their minds. I think there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be more thin,'' said <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, who served 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including a 1981-84 stint as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Tower discounted the results of a public opinion poll released Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, showing that 44 percent thought the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should reject Tower, 35 percent thought he should be confirmed and 21 percent were unsure. The survey of 1,046 adults last Wednesday and Thursday had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. A Time magazine-CNN poll released Sunday found similarly weak public support for Tower, with just 31 percent favoring confirmation. The poll of 504 adults on Thursday had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is publicly refusing to discuss possible successors should Tower be rejected, administration aides and congressional sources said the president was mindful of the odds against the nomination. They said some Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been pressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to give the job to his national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. Others mentioned as possible successors have included Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustine </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Martin-Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> TOKYO </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Authorities on Monday arrested two former senior officials of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest corporation on suspicion of bribery in a spreading stock scandal that has prompted calls for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign. Prosecutors said they arrested <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and a senior aide, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>. Investigators alleged the two officals were bribed with 10,000 shares of unlisted stock that <PERSON> Murata </PERSON> was offered by <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate. <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, 63, reportedly made $ 170,000 in profits when the stock was publicly traded and rose quickly in value. Shinto, 78, was known as an advocate of clean government and business until he resigned from <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> in December after acknowledging that $ 70,000 of the profits had ended up in his personal bank account. The remaining $ 100,000 allegedly was used for illegal political lobbying. The arrests followed the bribery indictments Saturday of four other businessmen _ the founder of Recruit, <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, another Recruit executive and two former <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said prosecutors added another count Monday to the charges against <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON> _ offering bribes to Shinto and <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>. Ten people have been arrested in the scandal, of whom five have been indicted. Three Cabinet members also have resigned because of Recruit links. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who acknowledged an aide bought 2,000 shares of Recruit stock, has denied any personal involvement and pledged Sunday to restore public confidence in his government by pursuing political reform. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Monday he was willing to turn over documents related to his aide's purchase of the shares, `` but it affects third parties and banks used by my secretary, so I feel I need to consult with them.'' Opposition parties have demanded officials implicated in the scandal testify in Parliament under oath. The three largest opposition parties have united in demanding a full parliamentary investigation into the scandal. The opposition Socialists and Communists have demanded that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign or dissolve the lower house. Newspapers reported members of the governing party have begun considering a caretaker government should additional arrests or public pressure force <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign. Some party leaders also are discussing the possibility of a dissolution of the lower house, requiring new elections, if <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> does not resign soon, news reports said. Public support for the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> has dropped steadily in the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government plans to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in commercial transactions, according to media polls. Party members want to hold off elections as long as possible, said <PERSON> Seisaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, professor of politics at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. An election loss for the party could force <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to step down as governing party president and prime minister before his two-year term ends this fall. <PERSON> Rei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiratori </PERSON>, dean of the department of political science and economics at <ORGANIZATION> Tokai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` If you look at opinions of voters, things are changing, but that only has an effect if there's an election So if <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is able to hold off having an election, there wo n't be much direct effect on politics.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and Western aid donors will seek an April truce in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil war to distribute food and medicine that could save hundreds of thousands of lives, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. They said about 625,000 of the 2 million to 3 million people displaced by the six-year war in the south may die of startvation during the April-December rainy season unles something is done. The pledge of a `` month of tranquility'' will be sought during a two-day conference that begins Wednesday in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Relief workers would use the cease-fire to send food and medicine south by plane, train and <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barge to create stockpiles against famine and disease, said the officials, all of whom demanded anonymity under orders from their agencies. `` We want to pre-position food and medicine and clothes so people wo n't be caught between the conflict and the famine,'' one official said. `` They need a massive operation.'' Both the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of former army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> have used food as a weapon. Western relief officials estimate that in 1988 alone, more than 560,000 people died of starvation or while fleeing the fighting. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and aid officials said they would use the conference to pressure both sides to accept the temporary cease-fire, but rebel claims of victory and political uncertanity in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> could upset their plans. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said the conference would set goals and initiate plans for stockpiling food and medicine. It is to be attended by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives, Western donors and the government. Rebel radio, broadcasting from neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s forces had overrun two garrison towns, <LOCATION> Nimule </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Parajok </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Equatoria </LOCATION> region along the border with <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. It warned foreigners to leave <LOCATION> Juba </LOCATION>, the regional capita., where 15,000 rebels have 5,000 Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees office said 20,000 civilians and army soldiers fled into northern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> in the past two days and emergency help was being flown to them. Up to 5,000 other Sudanese have crossed into <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s rebel army began fighting in 1983 for autonomy and more favorable economic treatment in the south, whose people are predominantly black Christians and animists. The government is dominated by the northern Sudanese, most of whom are Moslem Arabs. Several rebel military victories have been reported in the past few months. Western military sources say the insurgents have better arms than government troops and now have about 55,000-57 ,000 fighters facing a Sudanese army of 65,000 men The Western sources said the army's situation could grow worse in the rainy season, when the rebels usually have the battlefield advantage. Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, whose 3-year-old regime just survived a crisis caused by pressure from the military, politicians and the public to end the war, consulted with other parties Monday about forming a broad-based government. Government sources said privately <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on Tuesday despite the delicate political situation. The Western military sources said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had offered its southern neighbor $ 280 million worth of weapons. Sources close to the aid conference, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the intention was to send up to 100,000 tons of supplies to the three southern regions of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest country. `` There is no problem with the food; we have it,'' one source said. `` It is transportion which is a problem. `` Ideally we would have liked both the government and the rebels to be at this conference, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the donors are holding contacts with <ORGANIZATION> SPLA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- rebels -RRB- and hope to put enough pressure on it and the government to reach an agreement,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has put pressure on <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s government for peace talks and has urged other doners to do the same.

<HEAD>President of Uzbekistan Fired on Corruption Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The parliament of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> fired the Central Asian republic's president after charges surfaced that he promoted relatives of former government and party leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It was the latest blow against officials accused of corruption in the republic, which has been the focus of sensational articles in the Soviet press. The Uzbek Supreme Soviet, meeting in the capital of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> in an emergency session, relieved <PERSON> Pulat </PERSON> <PERSON> Khabibullaev </PERSON> from his duties as chairman of the parliament's executive body, the presidium, the official news agency said. <PERSON> Khabibullaev </PERSON> had been in his post for less than a year but recently new information was revealed about previous jobs he held, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` When occupying executive posts at the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Khabibullaev promoted by illegal means the careers of relatives of the former <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and government leaders who have compromised themselves.'' The dispatch did not say whether <PERSON> Khabibullaev </PERSON> faces criminal charges. The news agency listed the former leaders with ties to <PERSON> Khabibullaev </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Inamzhon </PERSON> <PERSON> Usmankhodzhaev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Normakhamandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khudaiberdyev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION> party chief for 22 years, died in 1983 and has been criticized harshly for allowing rampant corruption. <PERSON> Usmankhodzhaev </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON> and carried out an extensive anti-corruption campaign but was retired ostensibly for health reasons in January 1988. No identification was available for Kudaiberdyev. At Monday's Supreme Soviet meeting, deputies chose as the republic's new president <PERSON> Mirzaolim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibragimov </PERSON>, a 61-year-old teacher who represented <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Right to Jury Trial in Drunken Driving Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday that people accused of drunken driving usually have no right to a jury trial if they face a jail term of no more than six months. Despite mounting national concern over the seriousness of intoxicated motorists, the court said unanimously in a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> case that states do not violate fair-trial rights by treating drunken driving as a petty offense not warranting trial by jury. The court said imposing other penalties _ such as suspending driving privileges or requiring community service _ generally does not require a jury trial as long as six months remains the maximum jail term. In other action, the court: _ Left intact a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that allows public school officials to use all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force The court turned down the appeal of two kindergarten girls who were severely paddled for `` snickering.'' _ Rejected an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states _ Agreed to review the fines imposed against four <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan In its drunken-driving decision, the court left open the possibility it might be unconstitutional to deny jury trials if a repeat offender could be sentenced to more than six months in jail when convicted more than once. The justices rejected an appeal by two <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> men, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON>, who said the penalties for being convicted of driving under the influence are serious enough to warrant jury trials. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> on July 18, 1986, and <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON> was arrested in the same town on June 29, 1986. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> has not been tried. <PERSON> Fraley </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to two days in jail and fined $ 310. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> is believed to be one of five states that do not permit jury trials in such cases. The others are <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> classifies first-time drunken drivers as petty offenders by limiting the jail term to six months. Other possible penalties do not raise the offense to a serious crime, he said. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> law provides that a first-time offender can be sentenced to 48 hours of community work rather than jail. While doing the work, the offender must wear a black and white striped shirt that has the word `` offender'' written on it along with a picture of a liquor bottle bearing a skull and crossbones on the label. `` Even assuming the outfit is the source of some embarrassment ... such a penalty will be less embarrassing and less onerous than six months in jail,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The state law also imposes a maximum fine of $ 1,000, requires offenders to attend alcohol abuse education courses and suspends their drivers' licenses for 90 days. First-time offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in jail. State officials said jury trials in all drunken-driving cases would place an expensive burden on the municipal court system. In other action, the court: _ Ruled unanimously in a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> case that states may regulate natural gas production by imposing `` use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production _ Took steps against two affirmative action programs, citing its ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in the award of public works contracts in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system. And the court declared unconstitutional a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law requiring that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minority-owned businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women. _ Agreed to decide in a case from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state whether a prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other constitutional safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic drugs _ Left intact a $ 90,000 libel award against six <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> newspapers serving Korean-American readers for accurately reporting an announcement made by a South Korean government agency

 No elk showed up, but it was n't for lack of trying as 43 contestants growled, grunted, chirped and squealed through what was billed as the world elk-calling championship. The contestants each had one minute to give their best rendition of bull and cow elk calls, while a panel of seven judges listened intently behind a wooden partition at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> State Convention and Trade Center. About 1,000 people attended Sunday's finals of the contest, officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wapiti </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Elk -RRB- Calling Championships. Many of the callers, or `` buglers,'' heaved their shoulders and gyrated as they blew through two-foot long sections of rubber pipe that directed their screeching calls to all parts of the room in the convention center. One bugler brought a small tree and an armful of brush that he ripped apart to simulate the sound of an animal tramping through the woods. All but two of the callers had small rubber diaphragms in their mouths that they blew on to create the wide range of noises an elk makes. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, who has 25 years experience calling everything from alligators to turkeys, said most of the people who call elk do it so they can hunt them, but others are photographers or those who want excitement, he said. `` Imagine standing by a tree or just being out in the woods and if you can imitate that, out walks a 700-800 pound bull elk looking for you to run you away,'' he said. `` The excitement builds up when you see the antlers walking through the trees at you.''

<HEAD>Death Penalty, Land Preservation Tops Issues for Town Meeting Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> voters on Tuesday will replace socialist Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who is stepping down after eight years in hopes of seeing his movement broadened with the election of a like-minded candidate. `` I'm no <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, has said. `` Our backgrounds are different, our styles are different, but our political visions are the same.'' Mayoral elections in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> cities are part of the yearly Town Meeting Day, when residents of all 247 municipalities debate civic issues and have their say about how their towns and schools will run. In at least 35 towns, residents will be voting on a non-binding resolution asking the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the death penalty. The mayor's race is expected to draw a large number of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s 25,000 registered voters to the polls. `` I think -LRB- turnout -RRB- is going to be high, higher than normal,'' <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamarche </PERSON>, secretary to City Clerk <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>, said Monday. She said her office has already received more than the usual amount of absentee ballots for a mayor's race. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, 39, is the former community development director in this city of 38,000 people and a former city manager in nearby <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION>. He lacks <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' rhetorical flair and national reputation for bashing corporate capitalism, but has support from the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>'s main competition is Alderman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>, 46, a Democrat and clothing store owner who has support from both Democrats and Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> did n't field a candidate. An anti-development candidate, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, 48, is running on the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> ticket, claiming <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON> both have `` sold out'' to business interests. The move to put the death penalty question to voters came from four Republican legislators who say there is strong support for putting capital punishment back on the books for the first time since the 1960s. Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and two-thirds voted for reinstatement, Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheltra </PERSON> said. At least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental conservation commissions. Nine communities already have such boards, which are volunteer groups created to protect a town's natural resources. Proponents say the commissions help towns preserve and protect wetlands, streams and other natural resources at a time when overburdened town planning commissions are struggling to manage growth. `` It makes people aware of what's going on in their town. They begin to spark each other. It's amazing what an educational process it is,'' said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brande </PERSON>, the first executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. In several other communities, voters may authorize selectmen to create funds with local taxes to protect land resources, such as farmland, waterfront property and scenic areas.

 Two more men have been arrested in connection with the death of one of <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s bodyguards, police said Monday. The arrests bring to at least five the number of suspects held for the stabbing death of <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Madondo </PERSON>, 19, whose body was found last month in the sprawling <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Madondo </PERSON> was a member of a group of youths who served as unofficial bodyguards for the wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>.

<HEAD>104 Sikhs Freed, Arrive in Amritsar</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge freed 188 Sikh political detainees Monday, but police immediately rearrested 84 of them to face charges related to militancy that prompted a 1984 army raid on the holiest Sikh shrine. Witnesses said those released from more than four years' jail without trial arrived under heavy guard Monday at the scene of their arrests _ northern <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> city and its Golden Temple. Their freedom is part of a reconciliation drive Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced last week to try to end ethnic violence that has wracked the prosperous northwestern state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> for seven years. `` The 104 men are free to go where they want,'' Punjabi police chief K.P.S. <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> as 300 police guards released the detainees. Some of those freed shouted radical Sikh slogans demanding an independent homeland, witnesses said. They were among about 300 men and women arrested in June 1984 when former Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ordered the army to raid the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and rout Sikh militants who had taken sanctuary inside. At least 1,200 people died in the operation. Many of those arrested in the temple complex were pilgrims who were held for questioning but never charged. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards four months later in retaliation for the raid. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population but are a slight majority in the rich farming state of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Militants claim Sikhs are discriminated against by the Hindu majority who comprise 82 percent of the population. They have waged a bloody secessionist insurgency since 1982. In May 1987 the federal government dismissed the state government and brought <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> under direct federal rule in an effort to curb the violence. But killings of Hindus and moderate Sikhs escalated. At least 2,400 were killed by Sikh militants last year, more than double the number killed in 1987. More than 340 people have died this year. On Friday, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced a peace initiative. In addition to the release of political detainees, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said foreigners now can travel to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> without special government permission. He also said elections will be held, starting May, for village committees to supervise development work and law and order.

<TEXT>
 Jury selection began slowly Monday in the murder trial of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON>, who contends he was `` drunk and crazy'' during a 1987 shooting rampage that killed six people and wounded 12 in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The trial was moved from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> town to central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after a court-ordered survey indicated that mostresidents of the county where the shootings occurred believe <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> is guilty. The first prospective juror called for questioning on pretrial publicity offered a similar assessment when asked if she believed she could deliver an impartial verdict. `` I truthfully do not think so,'' she responded. She said she had a `` firm belief'' about the defendant's guilt, based on newspaper stories and television news reports, which she did not think she could put aside. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> dismissed her. Another of the six potential jurors questioned by noon Monday was former Sheriff <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mims </PERSON>, who said he had formed an opinion about the case but could put it aside to consider the facts as presented in court. State Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> and Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said they hoped to seat a jury by the end of Tuesday. The long-haired and bearded defendant is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 28 counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping. Public defenders for the 61-year-old former librarian are prepared to argue that he was temporarily insane when he shot students, shoppers, motorists and two police officers in two shopping centers on April 23, 1987. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> kept his eyes closed much of the time. The gaunt-looking former librarian sat quietly at the defense table. At times, he seemed to doze. <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> told police shortly after his capture _ following a seven-hour standoff in a supermarket _ that he believed neighbors, store employees and strangers were spreading rumors that he was homosexual. `` I just wanted people to leave me alone,'' he told investigators the morning after the shootout. `` I had to do something to stop them.'' However, he said he did n't remember hurting anyone.

<HEAD>Government May Help Pay for Efforts to Assist Its Workers to Quit
Smoking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government is considering helping pay the costs of programs that assist government workers in their efforts to quit smoking, officials said Monday. If the rule takes effect, the government will be following in the footsteps of many businesses, which have combined anti-smoking programs with workplace rules banning tobacco, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> is circulating the proposal, which would allow agencies use available funds for such programs, officials announced. `` Smoking cessation programs, particularly for federal employees, are long overdue. This is a positive step,'' <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said in a statement. Ms. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> is a former smoker. The plan would require that employees get advance approval for reimbursement in the anti-smoking programs. The regulation is being prepared in the wake of a ruling by the comptroller general that funding could be approved because smoking is a major contributing cause of illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and emphysema. The growth of both government and business rules banning smoking in many workplaces has spurred many companies to contribute to programs to help workers quit, said <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schellenbech </PERSON>, assistant vice president for media relations at the Cancer Society in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We think it's an excellent idea. Our surveys show that most smokers want to quit and need something to help them do that. The incentive of having program paid for may make a difference,'' she said. Costs for the programs range widely, she said, from free clinics conducted by non-profit groups to $ 200 and more for more-structured systems. The expense of the anti-smoking efforts can be justified by the savings in insurance costs, cuts in sick time and reductions in lost productivity, she said. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that organization would have no immediate comment on the proposal.

<HEAD>Supreme Court to Decide Case of Man Held Without Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to decide whether state officials can be sued for damages in federal court by people involuntarily held at state mental hospitals without hearings required by state law. The justices voted to review a ruling that would allow such a federal lawsuit by a man held in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state hospital for five months without a hearing that state law said he should have had within 48 hours. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities contend the man should be limited to suing in state court. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> was found wandering along a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> highway on Dec. 7, 1981. He was taken to a <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> community health services center where he was held for three days. During that time, <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> was hallucinating. He said he believed he was in heaven. After his stay at the center, <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> was transferred to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he remained until May 7, 1982. Despite a state law that entitled him to a hearing within 48 hours to challenge his detention and treatment, <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> did not receive a hearing. His federal suit alleged that various officials and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> acted `` with willful, wanton and reckless disregard of and indifference to'' his due-process rights. The suit invoked a much-used federal civil rights law. A federal judge threw out the suit, ruling that <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> was barred from filing it because he could win adequate relief _ including monetary damages _ by suing under personal-injury law in state court. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the dismissal, but the entire appeals court voted 8-5 last March 18 to reinstate the suit. The trial judge and three-judge appellate panel had relied on a 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in which the justices limited federal civil rights lawsuits when certain state court remedies exist. But the full 11th Circuit court ruled that the 1981 decision `` does not apply to procedural due-process violations when the state is in the position to provide pre-deprivation process.'' Because <PERSON> Burch </PERSON> could have been given a hearing before his right to liberty was deprived, the appeals court said, `` post-deprivation remedies can not provide due process.'' The 1981 ruling also dealt with prison inmates who alleged they wrongly had been deprived of their property rights, not their right of liberty. The case is <PERSON> Zinmermon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Burch </PERSON>, 87-1965.

 FCC Commissioner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> on Monday said `` exorbitantly paid'' television journalists and entertainers carried out an unconscionable campaign against the recent attempt in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise the pay of high-level federal officials by 51 percent. <PERSON> Quello </PERSON>, who as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would have gotten the pay hike had it cleared <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` the ultimate in unconscionable self-appreciation for TV and cable personalities, news anchors and talk show hosts, many of whom make 10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman, to indulge in a Messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep pace with inflation for congressmen, key government officials and judges.'' `` Are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest for ratings, money and power really performing more valuable service than those that grant and manage communications licenses, pass laws and govern the nation? I think not,'' <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said in a speech for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. A copy of the speech was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said the pay plan, which would have raised congressional salaries to $ 135,000, had been proposed by `` an impartial, well-qualified, non-political commission of civic leaders'' and had been supported by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the news media `` failed to emphasize enough that this was a catch-up increment'' recommended by the panel `` to keep government pay abreast of inflation.'' <PERSON> Quello </PERSON>'s salary is $ 80,700 and he said that `` with a moderate lifestyle, I have no problem living well on my government salary. ... But the salary level simply does not reflect the complexity or importance of commission responsibilities.'' He said that killing the salary proposal did not serve the public interest `` because it doomed much-needed reforms on eliminating congressional honoraria, limiting outside income and changing campaign fund laws.'' On another issue, <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> also repeated his view that it is essential that free, over-the-air television survive in any future scenario in which telephone companies are allowed to carry TV signals on fiber-optic networks. `` Only broadcasting, not cable or phone fiber, has a government licensed obligation to provide TV service to the public,'' <PERSON> Quello </PERSON> said, adding that broadcasting is the `` principal source of local news and government affairs, of vital local services like traffic, road, weather, school closing reports and emergency bulletins. And only broadcasting has a program-issues public file requirement for license renewal and for public inspection.'' He said it may be necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to require telephone companies to provide a basic antenna service to transmit local broadcast signals at no charge. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> is considering proposing that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> lift cross-ownership restrictions that prevent telephone companies from competing with cable TV systems in the phone company service area.

 Roman Catholics responding to a statewide newspaper poll gave Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> a favorable rating, but disagreed with a papal warning that dissenters should not be considered `` good Catholics.'' Sixty-one percent of the respondents to a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> poll of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Catholics held a favorable opinion of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> archbishop, who supports the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s position on social and moral issues. But 71 percent of the poll respondents said they should be able to dissent from official teachings and be considered good Catholics, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. Twenty percent disagreed, and 9 percent said they did not know whether dissent meant one could not be a good <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. During the pope's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit in 1987, he told the nation's bishops, `` It is sometimes claimed that dissent from the Magisterium is totally compatible with being a ` good Catholic' and poses no obstacle to the reception of the sacraments This is a grave error.'' Archbishop <PERSON> Rembert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weakland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> warned the pope then that an authoritarian style is counterproductive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The faithful are more inclined to look at the intrinsic worth of an argument proposed by the teachers in the church than to accept it on the basis of the authority itself,'' he said. The poll of 302 Catholics around the state was conducted Thursday and Friday for the paper by <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said it had a margin of error of 5.6 percent. `` Nothing is going to change because of a poll,'' Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> said Friday. `` His -LRB- the pope's -RRB- teaching authority does n't rest on whether or not people agree with him.

<HEAD>Bootleg Liquor Kills 130 in India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARODA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three people were arrested for supplying home-brewed liquor that killed at least 130 people and left 251 ill in the only Indian state that bans alcohol, authorities said Monday. Doctors said 151 of those 251 hospitalized were critically ill and probably would die. At least 25 people have been blinded by the lethal moonshine. In addition to the three arrested, several policemen have been suspended for failing to avert the tragedy in the city of <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION>, the local government said. Baroda is a major industrial center in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>, the only Indian state where alcohol is banned. The city 560 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> is home to 2.5 million people. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said the son of one supplier and the son of a prominent local politician are among those killed. The liquor normally is brewed from ethyl alcohol, alum and matured spirits. But this time, industrial methyl alcohol was mixed to the brew called `` lattha,'' which is sold in plastic sacks for 10 cents. Methyl alcohol paralyzes the central nervous system. Press Trust said many victims became dizzy and complained of nausea and stomach aches before losing consciousness. Most survivors were too ill to speak, but one told the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency the only difference he noticed was the liquor was `` sweeter than normal.'' A doctor at state-run Sir <ORGANIZATION> Siyaji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said groaning victims crowded against each other on the floor, on stretchers, and occasionally three to a bed. `` We do not have enough bottles of glucose to even administer first aid to the victims,'' the doctor said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION>'s chief minister, <PERSON> Amarsinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaudhary </PERSON>, ordered an investigation and promised action against the police officials who failed to avert the disaster, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. It said most victims were poor laborers who bought the liquor Saturday morning after receiving their monthly wages. The first deaths were reported about midnight Saturday, it said. As news of the deaths emerged, police fanned out across <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION> with loudspeakers blaring warnings about the liquor. About 300 people have died in seven illicit liquor cases in <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> in the last decade, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. Two previous cases occurred in <LOCATION> Baroda </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a court arraigned two alleged moonshiners Monday after police raided the largest illegal still ever found in the country. Police discovered a modern facility capable of producing 1,000 liters of high-grade alcohol a day hidden in stalls on a horse farm in eastern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Small-scale bootlegging is not uncommon in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, where the government has imposed a high alcohol tax to discourage drinking. A fifth of the cheapest scotch costs $ 32 and gin $ 27.60 at state stores which have a monopoly on alcohol sales. The moonshine sells for about a third of the state price.

 A Palestinian prisoner died in an interrogation room of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> security service, and two other Arabs were killed in a bloody day of clashes in the occupied lands Monday, authorities said. Soldiers reportedly shot and wounded 17 other Palestinians as residents of the occupied territories staged a general strike, closing shops and staying home from work. Monday's death toll was the highest in nearly a month in the 15-month Palestinian uprising, bringing the total of Arabs killed in the rebellion to 399. Seventeen Israelis have also died. Police launched an investigation into the death of <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Masri </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, arrested several days ago, had been kept in the Shin Bet interrogation room of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> prison since the arrest, a Prison Authority official said. The official said <PERSON> Masri </PERSON>, 32, suffered an ulcer attack in prison and was given medical help shortly before he died early Monday. `` We do n't know what caused the death,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. `` He was both very sick and also under intensive interrogation.'' Leftist legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> demanded a `` full and thorough'' investigation. He said authorities told him that the prisoner died of an ulcer, but `` these circumstances are very worrying. He was undergoing interrogation. <PERSON> Sadrid </PERSON> said the prisoner may have suffered from an ulcer, `` but I have to be convinced'' that he died of it. National police spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Yishayahu </PERSON> said police launched an investigation into the death, and the <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> official said his organization was conducting a similar inquiry. In 1984, two Palestinian bus hijackers were beaten to death during a Shin Bet interrogation. The former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Shin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, resigned two years later over the resulting scandal. A 1987 judicial commission report prompted by the incident concluded the <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> was allowed to use `` some means of physical pressure'' during interrogations. In other developments in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Monday, a small bomb exploded at a stop near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. No injuries were reported, and no group claimed responsibility for the attack. Police detained 20 Arabs for questioning. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops conducting a search-and-arrest raid fatally shot 24-year-old <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Hospital officials in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said he was shot three times in the face. The army confirmed <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>'s death and the raid, but said it was investigating the circumstances. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahiya </LOCATION>, soldiers killed <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> <PERSON> Azani </PERSON>, 19, during `` a gathering and a riot,'' an army spokesman said. The army spokesman said two other people were wounded in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lahiya </LOCATION> and the army placed a curfew on the village of 7,000. Fifteen other Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army command confirmed one injury and said it was checking further. The army said it freed 130 <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> detainees from the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> prison in southern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to mark this week's Moslem holiday of <PERSON> Isra </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Meraj </PERSON>. It marks prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s pilgrimage from <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where Moslems believe he ascended to heaven. The army also told four <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> families that their relatives are to be deported and offered the families a last meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> prison, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The four _ <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Karsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamous </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Muduh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wajih </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ajour </LOCATION> _ are likely to be deported on Thursday or Sunday, the reports said. Their deportation was ordered in August for alleged anti-Israeli activities. The army declined comment on the report. The deportations, if carried out, would bring to 53 the number of Palestinians expelled since December 1987. The policy has been condemned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations.

 A conservative group is mounting a last-ditch effort to drum up support for Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> with a public relations campaign in several states, a spokesman said Monday. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization raised $ 100,000 from supporters to take out newspaper advertisements and conduct television interviews by satellite. <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said the group's lobbying campaign came after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week urged conservatives to generate political heat for Tower, whose nomination has so far failed to garner much enthusiasm around the nation. `` The momentum has clearly swung,'' <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, said Monday he was `` sick and tired of the rumors and innuendos'' blocking Tower's confirmation. <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said his group plans to take out advertisements in newspapers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. It will also arrange for Tower's daughter, <ORGANIZATION> Penny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION>, to appear on televised question-and-answer sessions with reporters in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Those are states with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators who conservatives think might be persuaded to vote for Tower on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said. One conservative who has criticized Tower, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, says he thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not treated Tower fairly in not allowing him to confront his accusers. <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, has publicly criticized Tower's drinking habits and personal conduct. `` As much as I want to see him defeated, I do n't want to see him ruined,'' <PERSON> Weyrich </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview over the weekend. As for support for the nomination, a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll taken last Wednesday and Thursday said 44 percent of those questioned said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should reject Tower, 35 percent thought he should be confirmed and 21 percent were unsure. The survey of 1,046 adults had a margin of error of 4 percentage points. But <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> said he believed `` there is a growing disgust with Sen. -LRB- <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s shenanigans.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has spearheaded the campaign against Tower in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority A vote could come this week.

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Measure Down in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An index measuring the ability of a typical American family to buy a home dropped in January, reflecting increases in housing prices and mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said its affordability index was at 108 in January, down from 111.2 in December. It was the largest month-to-month drop since a similar decline in January 1988. The new January number means that a family earning the median income of $ 32,207 annually had 8 percent more income than needed to qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of a median-priced home. The median price for an existing home in January was $ 91,500, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. January's median was up $ 2,800 from the previous month The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 9.61 percent in January from 9.59 percent, representing a composite of fixed and adjustable rates. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the real estate group, said rising interest rates are likely to dampen home buying for much of the spring, particularly for first-time buyers. `` When rates are up, the first people shut out are borderline buyers,'' said the group's president, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>. `` Having to spend even a few dollars more a month for mortgage payments can keep them out of the market altogether.'' The affordability index has been above 100 since June 1986.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Calls for Seizing Vessels Owned by Convicted Ocean Dumpers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Taking a page from the `` zero tolerance'' policy of seizing boats from drug possessors, a congressman on Monday called for seizure of vessels owned by convicted ocean dumpers. `` Under current law, it is almost worth the risk to dump illegally because the fines and penalties are small compared to the cost of compliance,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. The ocean dumping of municipal solid waste or hazardous waste carries a maximum $ 50,000 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted legislation last year that makes the dumping of medical waste a felony with fines up to $ 250,000. <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said his legislation, introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, would give the federal government `` additional muscle'' by allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to recommend permanent seizure of vessels used to illegally dump waste in the oceans or the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Sound. Under the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> would seize the ship if the dumper is convicted and the judge in the case approves seizure as a sentencing option. Unlike the controversial `` zero tolerance'' policy, a dumping-connected seizure could only take place following a conviction, <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said. The administration's anti-drug policy allows the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to seize most recreational vessels immediately if any amount of drugs is found on board. `` This bill would protect the rights of boaters while sending a strong message to illegal dumpers that their actions will no longer be tolerated,'' <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> said. The Connecticut Democrat said while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> beach closures triggered by the illegal dumping of medical waste captured the public's attention last summer, ocean dumping has much broader economic and environmental effects. He pointed to the impact on shellfish and commercial fishing. The administration has not announced a position on the legislation, although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed during the campaign to push for stronger anti-dumping measures.

<HEAD>Second Train Accident in Two Months Raises Safety Concerns</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two commuter trains collided Monday and killed two people in the second British Rail accident in 48 hours, and the government came under pressure to investigate safety on its state-owned tracks. More than 40 people suffered mostly minor injuries in the 1 p.m. accident when the two trains drove into each other two miles east of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> center, said <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION>. The last two injured _ a train driver and a passenger _ were taken from the wreckage about four hours after the accident, said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state-owned company. Killed were the other driver and a passenger. The 44 injured were taken to hospitals, where five were admitted for the night, <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured in a collision of two British Rail trains near <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts. The `` preliminary conclusion'' of an investigation into that crash said human error was the cause, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION> is a division of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>, whose safety records have been under assault since December when a three-train crash killed 35 people at <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman and other lawmakers attacked the government Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> on the railroad's safety record. The Scottish crash `` confirms ... that we have been putting insufficient resources into preventing these accidents,'' said lawmaker <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman. `` The government's policy is clearly on trial,'' he said. Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON> said, `` it is time we did not have single inquiries into accidents of this kind, but a comprehensive review of the standing of BR -LRB- British Rail -RRB- in relation to government policy as it relates to safety,'' he said. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> acknowledged concern but denied government budget-cutting was a factor. `` The fact that there have been two serious accidents on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and now a third within three months is naturally a cause for concern,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said. He said inquiry boards into the latest two accidents will be ordered to report quickly, and he added: `` I agree there is public concern about <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and about safety on the railways.'' He said investment in the state-run railway is at a record $ 963 million this year due to rise to an average $ 1.29 billion annually for the next four years. In the <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> accident, the two short trains carrying about 70 passengers were traveling between the suburbs of <LOCATION> Springburn </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Milngavie </PERSON> when they collided. Each was going about 30 mph, he said. A warning explosive went off on the track before the accident, apparently triggered by a signalman in a box at the side of the track, but `` it was too late,'' said <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. That section of the track had been converted several years ago from a double to a single track to save money, said <ORGANIZATION> Scotrail </ORGANIZATION>, but it insisted it should have been safe. `` We were all sitting down in the train, and suddenly there was a large bang. People were thrown about all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a student who was on one train. After Saturday's crash, investigators found signs the driver of one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal before his train struck another London-bound train. British <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> said Monday a technical examination supported `` a preliminary conclusion that the accident was caused by human error on the part of the driver.'' The driver was one of 94 people injured when his train, traveling from <LOCATION> Littlehampton </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, hit a train traveling from <LOCATION> Horsham </LOCATION> to the capital. Police said Monday that 31 people remained hospitalized, 10 in serious condition. Six cars rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash, and several came to rest in the yards of homes. On Dec. 12, three trains crashed near busy <LOCATION> Clapham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION> during rush hour, killing 35 people. Railway officials believe a malfunctioning signal caused that crash. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> sent a message to <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> saying she was `` greatly distressed'' to learn of the third accident Monday. Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, wife of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, visited survivors of the <LOCATION> Purley </LOCATION> crash at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hospital.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, voicing skepticism about changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said Monday he supports `` lower levels of armaments'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but with a continued backup by nuclear weapons. `` For <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its allies, a survivable nuclear force will remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a conference of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He made the comments as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> proposed heavy reductions in troops and armor in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and urged negotiations to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the continent. The president also used his appearance before the veterans group to reiterate support for his embattled nominee for secretary of defense, calling <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> `` a fellow veteran'' and `` a fighter.'' `` And now he and I are fighting for what I think are some very important principles _ principles that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people understand, like fairness and truth,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also told the VFW, which boasts a national membership of 2.3 million, that he wanted to enlist its help to fight `` a threat no less real than the adversaries you have battled'' _ drug abuse. `` Your nation needs you again,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Meet with other leaders in your community _ church, clergy, law enforcement officers. Tell them the VFW volunteers are ready to help.'' Standing before a giant American Flag, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told his audience: `` You have my word. As long as I am president, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will stand fast on the front line in defense of freedom.'' On the `` key issue of change within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` there are still far more questions than answers.'' He suggested that there remains great uncertainty on `` the ultimate outcome of the events unfolding in the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and her allies must recognize that, even in light of the military cuts proposed by President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains the most formidable military power facing the free world.'' In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called Monday for percentage reductions of troops, tactical nuclear weapons and combat aircraft in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by both the East and the West. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and `` the main categories of arms'' by 10 to 15 percent over the next two to three years, and by larger amounts thereafter. The Soviet proposal went far beyond the reductions <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to suggest at conventional arms talks beginning Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not specifically address <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s comments in the speech to the VFW. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for `` an active effort in arms control to strive for increased stability at lower levels, lower levels of armaments.'' But he said he would oppose any attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> unilaterally. `` Imprudent unilateral reductions are not the path to peace and security and freedom,'' he said.

<HEAD>Army Warrant Officer Pleads Guilty to Spy Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Army warrant officer pleaded guilty to 10 espionage charges at the opening of his court-martial Monday under an agreement that prohibits the government from seeking the death penalty. Warrant Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, admitted that he participated from 1983 to 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver classified military information to representatives of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s civilian attorney, <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> is `` truly sorry for whatever damage he may have done to national security'' will `` throw himself on the mercy of the military judge.'' Col. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>, the military judge presiding at the court-martial at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION> in southwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, did not immediately accept <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s guilty plea. Under Army regulations, <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> will hear the prosecution's case against <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and defense witnesses before deciding guilt and punishment. Court officials said the final verdict and sentence probably will not come before Friday. Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and accused of delivering exposed film and documents dealing with communications intelligence and war plans to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations. At the time of his arrest, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was assigned to the 24th Infantry Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s G-2 intelligence section. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 and spent most of his career in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> working as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic and coded messages. Under the plea agreement, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> waived his right to a grand jury-type hearing to determine if a court-martial was warranted. He also agreed to be tried by a single military judge, rather than a panel of officers. Hall also agreed to submit to `` unlimited debriefing'' and polygraph examination by government officials and to testify, if called, at grand jury proceedings against <PERSON> Huseyin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yildirim </PERSON>, a Turkish-born, naturalized citizen to whom <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> allegedly passed the classified information. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said through a military spokesman that the defense would have no comment on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s motivation for passing classified information until after he has been questioned by <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> during the closed part of the court-martial. The maximum punishment Hall could receive, since the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to seek the death penalty, is life in prison, forefeiture of all pay and allowances, dishonorable discharge and a fine. The plea agreement, however, outlines the sentence that Hall will receive, unless the presiding judge, who is not permitted to see the sentencing agreement, imposes a lighter sentence. If the judge imposes a sentence that is harsher than the one in the agreement, the agreement will prevail. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> will not `` comment at any time now or in the future'' on the espionage case or his involvement with classified materials while in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Part of the plea agreement requires that <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> sign away any profits that might accrue to him in the future from any publication based on his involvement in the espionage case. A statement of the facts in the espionage case, which <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> was `` mostly written by myself,'' was included in the plea agreement, but it was not made public. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, his wife, and one of his children were in the military courtroom when the court-martial began. They are expected to testify later in the week in Hall's behalf `` His family was totally uninvolved and unaware of his activities,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said, `` and Hall will spend the remainder of his life working to prove that he eventually deserves to be reunited with his wife and children.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't push yet for a bill banning secondary picketing but is ready to move quickly if the strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spreads, a White House spokesman said Monday. Meanwhile, the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee scheduled a hearing for Tuesday and said he hoped for quick action on separate legislation to force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency board and end the strike for 60 days. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., suggested his legislation `` might give cover to the administration'' for the emergency action <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to take on Friday before the strike began Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday that as long as <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s striking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union refrain from picketing other airlines or railways, `` we would n't find it necessary to send up the legislation'' barring such secondary action. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is prepared `` to move rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.'' The million-member <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> has said it would picket other airlines and railways but called off the secondary actions, at least temporarily, after a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court ruled that other workers must n't honor such picket lines. The union is appealing. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were pleased that the strike by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinists had not spread. `` We're encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has occurred,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. `` That's an act of responsibility by the unions, and the president and I are very appreciative.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the White House Sunday night, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Asked if the president had second thoughts about refusing to invoke the Railway Labor Act to stop the strike, the spokesman said: `` We have no indication of any change.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was receiving `` daily briefings'' on the situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations rather than through government intervention. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the aviation subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> announced a hearing Tuesday on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision against intervening before 8,500 <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members walked off the job at Eastern. Most pilots and flight attendants refused to cross the picket lines, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was reduced to a relatively few flights during the weekend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board, which would have delayed a strike for at least 60 days. Union president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said it was `` incomprehensible to me'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not step in and stop the strike. <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action supported <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whom the union accuses of wanting to shut down and sell off money-losing Eastern. The union president said the administration threat to go to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to end secondary picketing rights `` is absolutely pro-Lorenzo, pro-company and pro-management, and it's a continuation of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration attitude. That's union busting.'' At a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> news conference, Rep. <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said Tuesday's hearing would look into both sides in the strike, and he promised quick action on his bill to force a resolution by a presidentially appointed mediation board <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> did not contend that the strike has reached `` emergency'' proportions. But he called it part of `` a long-term problem with broad implications for the airline industry. If not an emergency, this is a matter of great public interest.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> are to appear at the hearing.

 The government on Monday said <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s prosecutor general has resigned effective Sept. 1, the second top official to step down in a political scandal involving allegations of wrongdoing in drug investigations. Prosecutor General <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> also was granted an immediate leave of absence as authorities investigated whether he slowed a drug inquiry that led to the resignation of former Justice Minister <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Koller </PERSON> announced the decision based on a preliminary report by a special investigator, former <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Haefliger </PERSON>. The investigator was appointed shortly after Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s Jan. 11 resignation. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> was accused of tipping her lawyer husband about a drug investigation involving the company of which he was vice president. The scandal led to speculation that drug traffickers and certain companies were protected by government officials. The report found Swiss efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking were 10 to 15 years behind those of its neighbors and cited shortcomings in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> was accused of several mistakes, including an apparent slowness in the <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> affair. But <PERSON> Haefliger </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence to suggest <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> toned down internal reports on the involvement of Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s husband in the affair Apparently responding to media allegations, <PERSON> Haefliger </PERSON> said nothing pointed to punishable or `` scandalous'' deeds in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, 61, has denied any wrongdoing and asked for the investigation to clear his name, <PERSON> Koller </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> laid off 5,000 workers and shut down nearly all its operations today, saying it could n't continue to fly while pilots honored a 3-day-old Machinists walkout. `` We can not run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` We can not continue to inconvenience passengers. We can not afford the steady financial drain.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would concentrate on operating its most profitable routes _ its Northeast shuttle and flights between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal judge to bar pilots from taking part in the Machinists' strike and order them back to work. Eastern filed the request with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who did not immediately schedule a hearing. The strike has nearly shut down the airline, which says it had expected more pilots to stay on the job. The airline asked that the judge order the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to cease `` any strike, any concerted refusal to report to work, -LRB- or -RRB- disruptive behavior in any manner interfering with -LRB- Eastern's -RRB- normal operations.'' Eastern said the pilots, under the Railway Labor Act, must continue negotiating a contract and may not strike until after an official 30-day cooling-off period, as the 8,500-member Machinists union had. `` We knew that was coming,'' pilots spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. He said the pilots union attorneys would study the motion. The pilots union contends it's not on strike but is merely honoring Machinists' picket lines. The walkout crippled the airline's top-priority Northeast shuttle this morning as the work week got under way, but a court order prevented rush-hour chaos for a half-million rail commuters. On weekdays, the lucrative and highly competitive hourly shuttle serves primarily business travelers. On Sunday, the airline told the pilots they were committing `` economic suicide'' by honoring the Machinists' strike, which began Saturday. `` You ca n't fly without pilots,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said at a morning news briefing, before the lawsuit was filed. `` It's an hour-by-hour evaluation.'' Snow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> delayed the few flights that were ready. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,500 pilots and 5,900 flight attendants honored the strike by the airline's 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew. The strike began over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s demand for contract concessions and escalated a 17-month battle at the nation's seventh-largest airline The effects of the strike could spread Tuesday if the nation's pilots followed their union's request to strictly observe aviation rules starting that day Only 92 of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,000 daily flights took off Sunday, said <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. The pilots' union put the figure at 68. The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s usual 100,000 daily passengers at airports around the country Eastern is aiming at getting about 100 flights into the air today, focusing special attention on its hourly Northeast shuttle service, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern is awaiting federal approval to sell the lucrative shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. As of 10 a.m. today, six out of the normal 16 shuttle flights had gone out, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` Terrible weather has not helped,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. A morning snowfall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> forced cancellation of several Eastern flights on the shuttle between <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Before the snow began, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had announced it was doubling service on the same routes, but <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it could not immediately report the impact on its boardings. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, an Eastern spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the man who usually tracked such figures was `` out throwing bags'' as airline managers were pressed into airport duty. The strike had threatened to spill over into a sympathy action today against 12 commuter railroads around the country. The Machinists called off their plans Sunday after a judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with its 320,000 railway commuters, issued a temporary order banning railroad workers from honoring Eastern picket lines there. The same judge signed an temporary order Monday barring unionized <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> workers from staging a sympathy walkout until at least 3 p.m. Wednesday, when he will consider a longer-term stay. No commuting problems were reported during the morning rush hour at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or other cities that faced possible rail labor problems. But the union held out the possibility it would ask the railroad workers to walk out if a planned appeal upheld the legality of such a sympathy strikes. In public appearances Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> admitted that the carrier had miscalculated when it had assured travelers there would be no major disruptions. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, negotiator for the Machinists', also apologized for the inconvenience to travelers, but added: `` This is probably the purest classic case of evil vs. good that's been seen in the history of organized labor. ... These people were not workers who were greedy or doing anything wrong.'' By honoring the pickets and virtually shutting down the carrier, pilots threatened <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s `` very existence,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Sunday. `` By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economic suicide,'' he said. The company late Sunday sent pilots a letter telling them to return to work before noon Tuesday or be classified as being on strike. Pilots who are placed in that classification and later go back to work will be required to sign a `` preferential recall list,'' according to the letter from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of pilot operations. The wording appears to refer to last week's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allowed <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to reward flight attendants who crossed picket lines during a strike by moving them up the seniority list over attendants who refused to work. Thousands of anxious passengers holding tickets on canceled Eastern flights spent hours in lines that snaked around airport terminals, hoping to find seats on other airlines or get refunds. `` I'm not flying this stinking airline again!'' yelled <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vannua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, who had been waiting three hours at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to have his ticket validated for another carrier. Pickets chanted and baggage piled up at airports from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some Eastern planes were stranded on <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands without crews, the company said. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> joined pickets at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> today, and told them they should be allowed to take control of the airline in an effort to save it. `` If <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> ca n't fly it, let the workers buy it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told cheering strikers and supporters. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said his union was asking all pilots nationwide to strictly follow aviation rules starting Tuesday `` to ensure the safety of the -LRB- air traffic -RRB- system,'' which he said had been weakened by the Eastern disruptions. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the action would slow air traffic, but insisted that was not the intent. Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the deregulated airline business, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has racked up nearly $ 2.5 billion in debt and claims daily losses of more than $ 1 million. It wants $ 150 million in concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> over four years; the union wants $ 50 million in raises. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said his tough remarks were not a threat that pilots could be laid off. But Eastern may retaliate with firings. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who controls Eastern through his giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> holding company, sacked striking <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees in 1983 and put the carrier into bankruptcy. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is the main target of the strikers' anger. He is widely mistrusted by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers because of what they call his triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Many accuse him of provoking the strike to do the same at Eastern.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will seek an extra $ 300 million from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> medical care this year, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said Monday. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, the new head of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, had sought additional money for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s medical services branch, which agency officials have said for months is $ 600 million to $ 1 billion short of what it needs this year. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, who joins the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as veterans affairs secretary on March 15, said last week he doubted that the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> would approve a request for more money this year. <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>'s announcement came at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s budget for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said she was unable to confirm what <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> had announced about the current year. `` The issue has been the timing of such a request,'' she said. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had requested $ 29.96 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> in the coming fiscal year, not much above the $ 29.77 billion in the current year. Of those totals, $ 10.99 billion would be devoted to medical care in the new year, up from $ 10.8 billion this year. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to add $ 1.3 billion to the agency's budget for next year, of which $ 1.1 billion would be for medical care. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has sought an additional $ 607 million for next year, of which $ 512 million would be for medical care. Ms. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said it was premature to discuss final figures for next year, which will depend on the administration's negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the overall budget. Agency officials have complained to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they have been forced to raid equipment and supplies accounts to keep paying salaries. As an example of this process, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s medical director, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gronvall </PERSON>, told Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., that a new nursing care installation at <LOCATION> Prescott </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, would n't open for now even though complete At the insistence of congressional appropriations committees, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> had `` borrowed'' $ 46 million in funds earmarked for equipping new facilities to maintain `` a higher level of staff than would otherwise be the case,'' <PERSON> Gronvall </PERSON> said. `` If we get a supplemental appropriation we'll pay that back,'' and the <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> unit should be able to open later in this fiscal year, <PERSON> Gronvall </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Court Extends Custody for Palme Suspect Despite Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court extended the custody Monday for a man suspected of the 1986 murder of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> amid charges that his continued detention was aimed at winning a confession. It was the sixth time that <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s district court granted prosecutors' requests to hold <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who was arrested Dec. 14. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, 41, who has a history of violent crime and mental problems, is suspected of shooting the four-term prime minister in downtown <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. Prosecutors have said they have circumstantial evidence against him but they need further evidence to file charges. <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Holgersson </PERSON>, an expert in witness psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, charged that <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s detention in solitary confinement for nearly three months was a `` psychological assault'' that could lead to a `` false confession.'' <PERSON> Holgersson </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that such treatment `` can after a few days lead to serious psychological disorders ... and a ` confession' aimed at getting out of a psychologically unbearable situation.'' She said it appeared to be an example of `` malpractice against an individual by the Swedish judicial system.'' <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>, who objected to previous detention orders, raised no protest against the latest court decision. `` The conditions for my client are OK,'' he told <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` He is not subjected to any psychological assault.'' `` We must accept that he is forced to be in jail for a while. After all, there are circumstances against him,'' <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON> was quoted as saying. The search for Palme's killer produced the largest manhunt in Swedish criminal history, centered at first on a suspected international conspiracy. An $ 8 million reward offer produced no breakthroughs. Pressure to solve the case prompted senior officials to sidestep Swedish laws. The former head of the investigation, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmer </PERSON>, was dismissed in 1987 amid a dispute with prosecutors over who was in charge of the case. Former Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna-Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Leijon </PERSON> quit in June when it was revealed she had supported a private investigation into the case, which included illegal wiretapping and unauthorized access to classified documents.

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began her own literacy foundation Monday, saying its goal is to break the generational cycle of illiteracy by involving parents as well as children in learning. `` It's become very clear to me that we must attack the problem of a more literate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through the family,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told guests at a White House luncheon to launch the <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Foundation for Family Literacy. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been a leading advocate of reading and literacy programs for many years. She will serve as honorary chairman of the foundation but will not be involved in raising or spending funds. The premise of the new foundation is that since parents who ca n't read often raise children who ca n't read, both generations need help to break the cycle <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, chairman of the foundation board, said the group hopes to add an `` intergenerational dimension''' to existing successful literacy programs; provide seed money for family literacy programs; support training for volunteers and teachers; and honor successful volunteers, teachers and students. The foundation also plans to publish a book highlighting successful family literacy programs. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a cameo appearance at the luncheon, calling himself `` a fly on the wall'' regarding his wife's project. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the foundation fits with `` the concept of outreach, the concept of 1,000 points of light, the concept of one American helping another'' that he has tried to stress in his administration. `` I really ca n't think of anything that is more important than this focal point,'' he said. The luncheon participants, about 80 in all, included literacy experts from the corporate and voluntary sectors; <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>; Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>; Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, the librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Also attending were three little girls and their mothers who had participated in family literacy programs in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The programs and families were featured in a videotape shown at the luncheon.

 More than 5,000 parents of children attending private schools marched through the city center Monday to protest an education bill that could severely limit the independence of private schools.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Monday proposed huge reductions in troops and armor and recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> negotiate to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevarndadze </PERSON>'s proposals went far beyond the reductions <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to suggest at conventional arms talks that begin Thursday. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s purpose in proposing the missile talks was `` to see whether possible fissures in the alliance could be developed.'' `` I would n't characterize it as one of the most positive characteristics'' of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech, the official said. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told 35 foreign ministers gathered in a baroque palace that the West's goal, at least initially, is to reduce the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's current advantage in conventional forces. Estimates vary but give the Soviet-led alliance at least a 2-1 advantage in tanks. `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's conventional military preponderance, especially in the spearheads of attack, is what makes an invasion possible,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He urged Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to implement the `` new thinking'' that guides economic and political reform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by renouncing the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> `` beyond any shadow of a doubt.'' That doctrine permits military intervention in a Soviet bloc country in the event of a liberal insurrection. The late President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> introduced it after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> crushed the liberal `` Prague Spring'' of 1968 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` Those in the East should be free of the fear that armed Soviet intervention, justified by the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, would be used again to deny them choice,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He also said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> would organize a conference to prevent the spread of chemical weapons and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was exploring ways to speed the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added, however: `` Unilateral action is not enough. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has enormous stocks of chemical weapons threatening <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We therefore call on the Soviets to join us, to accelerate the destruction of their enormous stockpile of these frightening weapons.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said: `` I welcome this intention to explore ways for the early removal of chemical weapons from the Federal Republic.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, said earlier <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> telephoned the chancellor Saturday night and told him the aging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons would be withdrawn by 1992. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> countered a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal to retire at least 25,000 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks, then reduce armor, artillery and personnel carriers on both sides by 5-10 percent with a three-phase plan for radical cuts. The foreign minister's arms reduction program went far beyond <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s by adding missiles, combat aircraft and soldiers. `` Let me ask what kind of reductions are these if they do not affect the main component of armed forces _ their personnel?'' he said. `` And surely airplanes and helicopters can be used for a surprise attack.'' In the Soviet second phase, 500,000 men on each side would be demobilized. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research group, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has 3.09 million soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> more than 2.13 million. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> spends about $ 300 billion a year to defend <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where 326,000 Americans are stationed. As <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> explained it, the Soviet plan's progression would be: _ First phase, two to three years: Eliminate the imbalance in troops and arms, cutting 10 percent to 15 percent from the current lowest numbers. _ Second, also two to three years: Reduce forces by another 25 percent and withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons to a safe distance from `` the line of contact'' between the military alliances. That would make much of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> a nuclear-free zone. _ Third: Convert remaining forces to `` a strictly defensive character.'' While the reductions are made, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, negotiations should be conducted on eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. His proposal conflicts with the 40-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of deterring the Soviets with with a mix of weaponry incuding battlefield nuclear arms, which have a maximum range of 300 miles. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> wants to delay modernizing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance missiles in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for up to three years, with the support of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and officials of other West European governments. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is trying to change the chancellor's mind. In December, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced a unilateral withdrawal of six Soviet tank divisions and 50,000 men from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> would be reduced by 500,000. How <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s three-phase reduction fits into that is not clear. The foreign minister provided few details of an obviously complicated proposition. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in his speech the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has 3-1 advantages in tanks and artillery and more than 2-1 in armored troop carriers. He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer was `` a good start,'' but the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> would retain a 2-1 edge in tanks and artillery even after the Soviet leader's reductions.

 An avalanche in the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> on Monday killed two men, including a ski instructor, who were skiing off the trail near the Val d'Isere resort, police said. The instructor, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, and an unidentified companion were killed in the avalanche near <LOCATION> Tignes </LOCATION>, eight miles from the Val d'Isere ski resort, police in <LOCATION> Grenoble </LOCATION> said. A third man was hospitalized in critical condition, said the police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A woman skiing with the group was found uninjured about 10 minutes after the avalanche by rescue workers who saw her ski sticking through the snow, police said. The group had been off trail and was ignoring elementary safety rules, police said. Seven avalanches reported over the weekend left two skiers dead and dozens injured. French authorities have advised skiers to stay on the alpine trails, especially during the warm afternoons.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said Monday it regrets a <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> decision to postpone a joint excavation of the site of the crash of an American plane that went down during the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he understood the delay was related to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report last week which criticized <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' performance in international efforts to curb drug abuse. `` I do n't have the exact text of what they said, but I think that's the sense,'' he said. A team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts had been scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> over the weekend for the excavation, but Laotian officials delayed the project, which was part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to locate the remains of missing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. `` We regret that the Lao government has temporarily postponed plans for a joint crash-site excavation, which had been scheduled to start March 4th,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> have been working together closely to accelerate cooperation to resolve the issue of Americans still missing or otherwise unaccounted for in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>,'' he added. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> noted that four excavations have already been conducted, going back to February 1985. `` We hope that the delay of this fifth excavation will be brief, and are prepared to send our team of technical experts to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> immediately, once the Lao reschedule this important humanitarian effort,'' he said. `` We also look forward to expanding our dialogue and cooperation on narcotics matters.'' The annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> international narcotics control report said there had been no reduction in opium production in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in the previous year and that heroin refining continues. `` And there continues to be information that the extensive involvement of ... military and civilian government officials in the narcotics trade suggests this is a matter of de facto government policy,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Report 3,500 Mozambicans Starved to Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Roman Catholic missionaries say 3,500 people have starved to death this year in the remote northeastern part of war-torn <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, the national news agency AIM reported Monday. It was the first indication of mass starvation in the isolated coastal district of <LOCATION> Memba </LOCATION>. AIM quoted the missionaries as saying all the deaths occurred in <LOCATION> Memba </LOCATION>, 240 miles south of the border with <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. Widespread food shortages affect <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, and an estimated 6 million of the country's 15 million people need food aid. AIM's report of starvation deaths could not be confirmed independently. An AIM reporter who visited the region last week wrote that he witnessed five deaths from starvation in one town on a single day. The region has been hard hit by the country's 12-year-old civil war and a yearlong drought. Threats of attacks by rightist rebels, combined with poor roads and transportation have made it difficult for the government and relief agencies to provide regular supplies to the remote region, AIM said. The agency also reported an estimated 600,000 people, most children, have died as a result of the war. Citing a report produced jointly by <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> and the Mozambican government, AIM said the overall casualty figure includes deaths of 494,000 children `` from causes directly attributable to malnutrition associated with the war.'' <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> is one of the world's poorest countries. Two of every 10 babies born here die before their first birthday, according to the <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report. As many as 375 children out of 1,000 die before the age of five, among the highest rates in the world, the report said. The war pits the Marxist government against guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION>, whose hit-and-run attacks on civilian and military targets have severely disrupted the country's economy <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> backed the rebels in the early 1980s, but says it has ceased assistance despite Mozambican claims that <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s support continues Rebel attacks shut down 822 health clinics between 1982 and 1987. Only 567 of those have been rebuilt, the report said. `` Some preventive activities, such as vaccination campaigns, have to be organized almost clandestinely in order to prevent them from becoming a target,'' the report added. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report last year estimated that 100,000 people were killed in the war from 1985 to 1987.

<HEAD>Government and Opposition Clash on Wage Indexation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government and opposition negotiators had a stormy session Monday over a Solidarity proposal to reduce 60 percent inflation by tying wages to the cost of living, opposition economists said. The `` round table'' talks on economic and political reform entered their fifth week with delegates from both sides under pressure from their leaders to reach agreement by late this month. <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who founded Solidarity in 1980 and is trying to get the union made legal again, said he probably will have his second meeting with Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> in less than a week about problems in the talks. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and leaders of provincial party organizations convened to hear reports on progress. The meeting was called a `` consultation,'' not a formal party session, but was expected to produce advice for the government negotiators. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he expects new `` political decisions'' intended to move the talks forward. About the indexing question, opposition economist <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON> said: `` We had the impression today the government side blocked itself. ... We are going to face a very difficult situation tomorrow. I think the situation is very difficult and very dangerous,'' <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON>, a member of the working group on economic issues, said officials feared indexing would limit the authority of managers who control pay decisions. He said Solidarity leaders decided Sunday the government must agree to a form of indexation if it expects union agreement to a package of reforms that includes opposition membership in Parliament. `` Our demand for indexing is the indispensable condition,'' <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON> said. Solidarity believes wages must be indexed to inflation, at least temporarily, to give workers some sense of security while economic reforms are introduced. Deputy Premier <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> said on state television the government believes some indexing is needed, but `` it has to be introduced in a prudent manner so it does not disturb ... the motivating function of pay.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by train Monday from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he works as a shipyard electrician, and he met with opposition delegates to the talks, said <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Konopka </PERSON>, a spokesman for the union leader. He would not give details. Working groups on trade union problems and youth issues also reported no progress Monday. Although the union has resolved the issue of how to legalize Solidarity and other unions, it is stalled on the mechanics of organizing. The youth subgroup had no problems with a proposal to make the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> legal again, but government negotiators said they want a broader agreement under which the opposition would endorse a statement on values in rearing children. `` Today's discussion of the youth table resembled a mental hospital rather than negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Celinski </PERSON>, leader of the opposition team. <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiatr </PERSON>, a government delegate, said it was possible no agreement would be reached in the youth talks, but added that the decision to legalize the student association might be made at a higher level. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has expressed optimism in recent days about the unprecedented talks between communist authorities and the opposition movement led by Solidarity. The talks are aimed at producing a compromise under which the government would legalize Solidarity and other banned groups in exchange for their help with a reform program. Solidarity, the first independent union movement in the Soviet bloc, was banned after martial law was imposed in December 1981.

 Security forces have arrested a Palestinian who allegedly made numerous anonymous telephone calls falsely claiming he kidnapped a missing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, a military spokesman said Monday.

He declined to identify the suspect, against whom no official charges have been filed.

No cassette was delivered. The group the caller identified has not been heard of previously. The military spokesman, who by custom is not named, said it was not yet clear whether the suspect made all the telephone calls. `` The matter is still under investigation,'' he said.

 Paid pitches for jeans, a candy bar and dandruff shampoo were mixed in with a fast-paced menu of current events Monday as Channel One, the televised news show for teen-agers, had its first school day. The paid advertising on the show, which is produced by Knoxville-based <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, has enraged some education groups who want Big Business barred from making sales pitches to students inside the classroom. The fourth 30-second commercial was a public service announcement for the Partnership for a Drug-Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Students, teachers and parents who witnessed Channel One's debut at Central High expressed few reservations about the ads. ` It's fine with me,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bible </PERSON>, a 14-year-old freshman. ` You get more pressure from other students than you do from the commercials.'' <PERSON> Toi </PERSON> <PERSON> McCane </PERSON>, a 17-year-old senior, said the commercials `` are just the same thing you get on the news at night.'' The 12-minute program included two minutes of commercials. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> is a media concern that has developed magazines and posters that can be used by advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences, such as people in doctors' waiting rooms. Channel One is <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>' first venture into television, and groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION> are opposing sending commercials into school along with the news show. ` They are trying to make it a part of every school day, and this medium has a much stronger impact than any other,'' said <PERSON> Tari </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the National PTA. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, the company's chairman, said schools ca n't afford the equipment and level of programming he is providing as part of the Channel One project The company has provided each of the six test schools with about $ 50,000 worth of television monitors, video recording equipment and a satellite dish on which they can receive the daily show. In addition to Central, the show debuted Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Billerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gahr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. The sixth test school, <ORGANIZATION> Withrow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, was closed Monday by bad weather. If the test proves successful, Whittle hopes to expand it nationally to as many as 8,000 schools in the fall of 1990. In exchange for the equipment, the schools agree to run the news show once each school day. After the show began with flashy graphics, two youthful anchors read headlines illustrated with purchased film footage about the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike, the battle over <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s nomination as secretary of defense and life as a Soviet teen-ager. The show's last segment dealt with the controversy over Channel One itself. In <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON>'s senior homeroom class, all 20 students appeared to follow the show intently, fidgeting only during the shampoo commercial. Whittle gave the show high marks for content, but said the broadcast's pacing needed some work and his anchors needed to `` loosen up a bit.'' He said the complaints had not deterred any advertisers who have signed up for the test run which will involve 25 shows over the next seven weeks. Eight advertisers have signed up, he said, and he is courting four more. No show will have more than two minutes of commercials, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmeister </PERSON>, superintendent of the <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> public school system, said he thinks the show's educational value was worth two minutes of paid ads. Besides, he said, `` kids do n't pay a lot of attention to commercials anyway.''

 A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> `` propaganda terrorists'' are trying to intimidate <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee into voting against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and ought to be punished. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> said the `` righteous right'' is operating its lobbying effort from within the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and is behind `` a mailing insisting Republicans have to be unified and anything short of censure or expulsion would be a whitewash.'' He said, `` It sounds like a vigilante group ... out of the last century with a ` hang him regardless of the evidence' mentality.'' The ethics committee has been meeting behind closed doors over a series of ethics charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, including allegations he used his office for personal financial gain. An independent counsel has spent nine months investigating the charges. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied violating any law or rule of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, although he has conceded he might have done some things differently if given the chance to do them over. The panel, evenly split with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic members, met to consider the independent counsel's findings last week, and the outcome of the investigation may be known sometime this week. Speaking on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor Thursday, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> decried the actions of a number of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponents, including Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.

He is proposing the House adopt sanctions, such as censure or expulsion, for members found to have improperly influenced members of the ethics committee. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> did not respond immediately to requests to his office for an interview.

 Helicopter gunships and navy gunboats of the army's Christian command patrolled <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s territorial waters under Druze rocket fire Monday to prevent foreign merchant ships from using illegal port facilities operated by feuding militias. The move, aimed at choking off the main revenues of Christian and Moslem private armies, has triggered a political crisis in the Moslem camp. Police said neither of the army's two French-built Gazelle gunships was hit when militiamen of Druze warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> fired rocket launchers near the port of <LOCATION> Jiye </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. To underscore Moslem objections to the Christian patrols, the Moslem army command ordered the closing of a Green Line crossing point linking the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem sectors only one week after rival military forces reopened it. A communique issued by the command of Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, who heads Moslem army units in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the decision to close the crossing at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port was made on orders from Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Moslem cabinet. The communique said the Christians' sea and air patrols were `` provocative acts.'' The makeshift harbor at <LOCATION> Jiye </LOCATION> has been the main sea outlet for the Druze community, a Moslem sect based mainly in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains, since they captured it from the Christians in 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique said foreign ships heading for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> have been warned not to enter any of the militia-controlled harbors along the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country's 110-mile coastline. The ban was ordered Sunday by Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military cabinet vying for power with <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Syrian-backed government. It was part of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s campaign to restore state authority, eroded by 14 years of civil war in which Christian and Moslem militias took over many government functions. The militias use the ports to bring in arms and supplies as well as imported goods sold in the areas they control, depriving the state treasury of an estimated $ 100 million a year in customs duties. `` We're not forcibly shutting militia harbors or blockading them. ... We are merely blocking foreign ships from going there,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on condition of anonymity. `` If a ship insists on violating the ban, it will be seized and forced to sail into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> port to question its captain before beginning legal procedures,'' said the spokesman. He listed five legal ports _ <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> north of the capital and <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and Tyre to the south. To supervise the new ban, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> revived a maritime authority made up of representatives from the public works ministry, the navy, air force, police and the customs department. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said Monday that the ban could undermine `` the positive mood that has lately emerged about a possible end to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s plight.'' He was referring to mediation efforts by an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee set up in January to help resolve a constitutional crisis that has left the country without a president for 162 days and threatens to formalize its de facto partition into Christian and Moslem cantons. President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim cabinet when his 6-year-term expired Sept. 22 without a successor being elected. Moslems refused to accept <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and pledged allegiance to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who governed during the Amin presidency. In another development Monday, an associate of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON>, a Lebanese international banker, said <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> was kidnapped Feb. 19 and is being held for ransom. But some <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers say the 48-year-old <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> fled after a run on his bank and after accusations he embezzled $ 200 million. Police said they know nothing about his reported disappearance. <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON>'s spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> could not be contacted by telephone. Until recently, <PERSON> Tamraz </PERSON> was chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Mashrek </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s second largest bank, which is involved in a liquidity crisis with several subsidiaries, including banks in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>

 More than 100 coal miners ended a five-day strike Monday after the government agreed to correct their pay system, a dissident reported. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a Moscow-based journalist, said sources in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> reported that 115 miners had been striking while underground since Thursday and began a hunger strike two days ago. <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION>, with a population of 90,000, is 1,200 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It is in the <LOCATION> Pechora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s major coal mining regions that in 1985 produced 28 million metric tons of bituminous coal. Workers in the Northern Mine began the strike to protest increased work orders, to demand replacement of the facility's director and chief economist and a reduction of the management staff, according to <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> He said the strikers also demanded changes in the salary disbursement system. A group of supporters, who called their organization Solidarity after the independent union movement in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, pressed the miners' case with authorities while the strikers remained underground, according to <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> He said Soviet Coal Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> Saturday, negotiated with the strikers and promised to partially meet their demands including paying them 158,000 rubles -LRB- $ 254,800 -RRB- to compensate for problems in the salary system. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said the miners announced the end of the strike on Monday. The Soviet government has traditionally claimed that strikes are inconsistent with the Communist system that places priority on the interests of workers. But last year there were strikes of an unprecedented scale and length in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in the dispute over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to review the antitrust implication of the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger because he said cable television customers could be big losers in the merger between the media giants. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said there were `` strong indications'' that the $ 18 billion merger between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> could substantially reduce competition and diversity in the communications and entertainment field, particularly in the cable television industry. `` Such a development is especially disturbing in light of a continuing trend toward further concentration and reduced possibilities for meaningful competition in cable television,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rule </PERSON>, the assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division. `` I ... urge you to undertake a careful and thorough review of this proposal,'' said <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights. <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Togans </PERSON>, a staff assistant in Rule's office, said the letter had not been received there Monday. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said the merger, which was announced Saturday, would link two of the world's leading media and entertainment conglomerates, creating a company worth $ 18 billion. Time publishes Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines, and owns <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest pay cable service, along with <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s sister cable service, <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>. Time also owns <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second largest cable system <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> owns the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> movie and television studios, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, along with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the fifth largest cable system in the nation. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said less than 1 percent of the 8,000 communities nationwide served by cable have more than one cable system. `` Cable is an unregulated monopoly throughout the entire country,'' he said. He said a <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger could extend the dominance of the larger multisystem cable operators over small cable companies. `` With the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> systems, there is an even greater incentive for Time to deny competing technologies its existing programming _ and the new programming which <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> is expected to create.'' `` It is this ability to control both the conduit for programming -LRB- the cable wire -RRB- and the content of the programming -LRB- through <ORGANIZATION> MSO </ORGANIZATION> equity interest in programming ventures -RRB- that poses the greatest threat to consumers,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. `` The absence of competition in the delivery of cable programming means that consumers have no protection against unrestrained rate hikes. The de facto editorial control which MSOs can exercise over new programming threatens diversity of information and entertainment sources available to cable viewers,'' he said.

 Police detained some of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s leading actors Monday after they protested an anticipated crackdown on independent-minded journalists. In response, the actors canceled at least one performance. <PERSON> Ulolis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumpis </PERSON>, one of those detained, said they demonstrated for an hour outside <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>, capital of the small Baltic state the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> absorbed in 1940 along with <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. As the protest was ending, a police officer told the group of about 50 people it was illegal because they had no permit, <PERSON> Dumpis </PERSON> said. He said the officer gave them three minutes to disperse, but other police moved in almost immediately and started taking people away in two groups. About 15 were in his group but he could not tell how many were in the other, the actor said. They were held for about two hours and released without being charged, he said. Actors of the Latvian National Theater, Youth Theater, Theater of Opera and Ballet and the Artistic Theater met after the detentions to decide whether to perform. <PERSON> Aivars </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovics </PERSON> told about 200 performers in the small hall of the National Theater of the day's events, and they decided to cancel the performance there. <PERSON> Dumpis </PERSON> spoke to about 700 people in the theater's cream-and-red large hall and said the actors decided the play in that hall should go on. Those attending the meeting were in 17th century garb for the performance of `` Once Upon a Time There Was a Rider'' about a struggle for peasant rights 300 years ago. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a grassroots group campaigning for greater autonomy, said scheduled performances also were given at the other theaters. Actors who protested outside headquarters said they expected the authorities to act this week against up to 16 journalists working for state television who have been accused of creating ill-feeling between ethnic Latvians and ethnic Russians. Of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>'s 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> and 33 percent Russian. Two television journalists, <PERSON> Velta </PERSON> <PERSON> Purinya </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> <PERSON> Grunte </PERSON>, said they were told privately they would be disciplined. Ms. <PERSON> Purinya </PERSON>, a member of both the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said she was told the nightly public affairs program Panorama `` whips up bad feelings between Russians and Latvians'' by showing film of demonstrations and reading letters from viewers Editors of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> weekly <PERSON> Atmoda </PERSON> said censors would not let them publish an article Monday about the arrests of young Latvians who protested conscription into the army. <PERSON> Atmoda </PERSON> appeared Monday with pictures of scissors pasted where the article would have been. Several hundred people gathered at downtown <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>'s Freedom Monument on Monday for a rally by the Movement for the National Independence of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>. The rally honored <PERSON> Oscars </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalpaks </PERSON>, who commanded the army of independent <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> between the two world wars. <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> were taken over by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> one year after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s pact with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> assigned the region to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> sphere of influence. In January, <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> party <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON> expressed alarm about tension in the republic, saying even the party felt the effects of `` ethnic stratification.''

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> retirees who helped supply the Nicaraguan Contras testified Monday they also got involved in the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deals through an <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> associate, the first mention of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s month-old trial. The testimony by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> _ and later by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> _ brought a quick reaction from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who reminded lawyers in the case, `` I asked you not to go into the hostage situation.'' Charges involving diversion to the Contras of profits from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms deals were dropped earlier after the administration complained that too much damaging classified material would have to be disclosed in connection with those counts. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> called lawyers to the bench Monday and said bringing up <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the hostages `` will extend the trial unnecessarily.'' However, defense attorney <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> continued to dwell on the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> issue in his questioning. With the jury out of the courtroom, he told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that the arms-to-Iran initiative is mentioned in four of the 12 counts remaining against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and that prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> repeatedly referred to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in his opening statement to the jury. Said the 78-year-old <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>: `` I'm simply trying to limit proof so we could end this trial while I'm still alive.'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified he was brought into the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> deals by former Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who told him, `` This could lead to the release of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' `` General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> asked me to assist in the transportation of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, who followed <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> to the stand, said he went to work for <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> the day after he retired after 20 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on May 1, 1986, and was put to work on the Contra supply operation, which was suffering from disorganization. He said he had worked with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> in the 1980 attempt to rescue the 52 American hostages held in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and was called by the retired general again to help in 1986. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> was asked Monday if he believed the new effort was to be under the authority of the president. Yes, he said. When <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> first joined the Contra resupply operation, he said, none of the airdrops had been successful. Signal fires that pilots expected were n't there, radio communications did n't happen. By September, he said, things had been whipped into shape and there had been 15 successful missions. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> was so proud of the progress that he put together an album of pictures and showed them to North. `` He said he would like to take it with him and show it to his top boss,'' said <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>. `` Who did you understand he was talking about?'' asked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromwich </PERSON>, one of the prosecution lawyers. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him `` I know I ca' t get you a medal, but some day the president will shake your hand and thank you But that never happened, <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> said the supply flights stopped after Oct. 5, 1986, when one of the planes was shot down. The pilot, co-pilot and a Contra were killed and the loadmaster, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasenfus </PERSON>, bailed out and was captured. At day's end Monday, conservative fund-raiser <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Spitz'' Channel had begun testimony that was to be resumed Tuesday. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, helped handle the covert effort to ship arms to the Contras in early 1986 _ when official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid was barred _ and ran flights with humanitarian aid when that was legal. In January 1986, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, `` I was told they desired to move classified cargo from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, he said, `` asked if I could arrange that.'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> told him, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, that flights `` must leave from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, no one must know the cargo and no one must know the ultimate destination. It could not land in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and could not go through customs. And he said it was possible the aircraft and crew could be detained in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and not released.'' <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> became impatient while he was trying to figure a way to meet the requirements. He quoted the former general as saying once, `` You must figure this out. You must convince <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> to do the job. This could lead to the release of the hostages.'' <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, which once was CIA-owned, by that time had been turned over to private ownership and had been used to fly aid to the Contras. The company did become involved in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms flights, but <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> was not asked that specific question. <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also asked him in 1986 to make the arrangements to fly North and his boss, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> earlier pleaded guilty to charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair and was sentenced Friday in a separate federal court to a $ 20,000 fine and probation but no prison term. After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in October 1985 authorized $ 27 million to be spent for humanitarian aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said he contracted with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to haul supplies to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Once, lethal weapons were added to the supplies by Contra officials when a plane stopped in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to refuel on the way to Hondurs, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said. Later at a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gadd </PERSON> said, `` they put it to me this should never have been done ... the mix should not exceed 10 percent'' arms and ammunition. Among the 12 criminal charges against North are four counts of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying his involvement in the Contra resupply operation.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> lifted a nationwide curfew on Monday but kept martial law in effect after riots that officials said killed at least 247 people and injured nearly 2,000. Newspaper reports have put the death toll from last week's riots over price increases as high as 600 and the number of injured at several thousand. Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating 2,300 people. Police recovered at least five more bullet-riddled bodies on Monday in one of the slum areas ringing <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, and officials said the search for more bodies continued. The riots were the bloodiest in this nation's modern history. The defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Alliegro </PERSON>, said the 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew _ <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s first in 25 years _ was lifted in view of the `` normality prevailing all over the country.'' The curfew was imposed Feb. 28, one day after riots and looting broke out. The unrest was touched off by steep increases in bus fares, gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services _ part of a government austerity plan. Independent reports said many people were killed by stray bullets during battles between security forces and snipers. Heavy fighting went on until Friday, and sporadic gunfire was heard over the weekend. The five bodies found Monday were of victims 20 to 25 years old and were discovered in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> area, scene of fierce fighting Thursday and Friday. The neighborhood is a mile north of the government's Miraflores Palace. Army units were deployed in west and east <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> to quell any snipers. About 15,000 troops joined police in guarding main avenues, supermarkets and government buildings throughout the capital as long lines of people waited to buy food. Under martial law, soldiers can search houses without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely without charge. Student leaders said at least 100 <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> students were under arrest and 12 were missing. `` Many were taken from their houses by police and national guards and the only explanations their parents received was that civil rights had been indefinitely suspended,'' said <PERSON> Jazmin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaimes </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION>' Central Univesity. Ms. <PERSON> Jaimes </PERSON> said police tortured one student, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` She was arrested Monday, and witnesses have told us she has n't eaten anything since,'' she said There was no official comment on the claim. But the defense minister denied on TV the reports of missing people, saying the armed forces went onto the streets `` not to repress but to re-establish the order which had been altered.'' Primary and kindergarten schools resumed classes Monday, and secondary schools were expected to reopen this week. When universities would reopen was not clear. Universities have traditionally been centers of protest. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> ordered the price increases as part of an austerity program arising in part from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s $ 33 billion foreign debt. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest debtor nation behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

 Police opened fire on Tibetan protesters who marched through <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and burned <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> businesses Monday in a second straight day of violence. Four Tibetans were reported killed. Security forces moved into the city's Tibetan section and pulled people from their homes, taking some away in jeeps, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists said. Chinese troops also beat Tibetans, said the travelers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of police reprisal. `` One boy's face was completely bloodied,'' said a man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` He was no older than 10. Blood was coming from his ears, his eyes.'' The Americans and other tourists were contacted by telephone in the Tibetan capital from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. As they spoke, automatic weapons fire and exploding tear gas canisters crackled in the background. Bonfires burned in the streets, they said. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported one Tibetan was killed and eight others, including two policeman, injured in the violence Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> had said 10 Tibetans and one Chinese policeman were killed in anti-Chinese demonstrations Sunday. Western travelers quoted Tibetans as saying that many more had died on Sunday and that at least four Tibetans had been slain Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday deplored the use of weapons on pro-independence protesters in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> and called for a restoration of order. `` We have made clear to the Chinese both publicly and privately in the past our concern for human rights in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a representative for the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the Tibetans' spiritual leader, issued a message from the leader saying he was `` deeply saddened'' by the latest bloodshed `` I have always tried to find a peaceful solution to the tragic situation in my country,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the 13th century. Many Tibetans say <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> should be independent and led by the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled in exile during the aborted uprising in 1959. Police in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> fired from rooftops near the city's main square late Monday afternoon, killing at least two Tibetans, an American tourist quoted Tibetans as saying. Several hours later, security forces fired on a group of 40 independence activists as they threw rocks at a building near the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, another tourist said. He quoted Tibetans as saying at least two protesters were killed in that incident. On Monday morning, thousands of Tibetans flooded the old city, breaking into the small <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> - and Moslem-run stores that fill the area, pulling out their contents and burning them in bonfires along the main thoroughfare in the city The crowd, made up mostly of young men, blocked off parts of the old city, barricading it with metal tables and garbage cans, witnesses said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said many people were unable to go to work. Tibetans stoned Chinese who tried to bicycle through the area, foreign witnesses said. One tourist said he saw a policeman dragged from his bike and chased down the street at knifepoint. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the crowd `` tortured'' a policeman, but gave no details. Police guarded the Chinese section of town, but later Monday they moved across a broad road into the Tibetan-held area. The Americans saw hundreds of police, armed with Chinese-made AK-47s, move in. The armed troops met up with another 100 helmeted troops, carrying only shields and sticks. `` The troops charged up the street at a half-trot,'' said the tourist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` A lot of tear gas came into the hotel. They were firing up the street pretty fiercely.'' At one point, soldiers banged on the window of the hotel's restaurant where several foreign tourists were eating dinner `` They pointed their guns at our faces,'' said the New Yorker. `` All of us hit the deck.'' Troops also burst into Tibetan homes and grabbed occupants, Americans said. `` Some of them were taken away,'' the New Yorker said. `` Others were beaten on the spot.'' Soon after the troops disappeared down the street, the angry Tibetan crowd regrouped and burned a Chinese-owned shop. The city had quieted by midnight, but bonfires still smoldered, said an American. The protests began Sunday when 13 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and nuns started marching near the Jokhang, shouting `` Independence for <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.'' Police opened fire. A crowd of Tibetans then began ransacking Chinese buildings. The bloodshed occurred days before the 30th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese on March 10. It marks the fourth violent outburst in 18 months against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rule. Scores have died in the earlier protests. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, about 100 Tibetan refugees, some raising banners that said `` Stop massacres in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'' and `` <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> is ours,'' demonstrated in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>.

 In becoming the first Democrat to support <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> followed the rule he always applies to presidential appointments. `` My general approach is that the president is entitled to have his appointments'' unless it can be proved `` that the person is flawed or that he would be a detriment to the country,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said last week after meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to discuss the Tower nomination. In the case of Tower, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said he was not convinced after reading the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports that the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator has a drinking problem that would disqualify him from serving in the nation's top defense post. Had Tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> might well have voted against confirmation. But he said the fact that the secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president makes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responsible and accountable for Tower's conduct. `` It is the president's cabinet,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said, `` not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' cabinet. Being at the center of a partisan battle over a presidential appointee is nothing new for <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, a 67-year-old ex-Marine and former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> chief justice who was former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s most consistent Democratic support in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. As a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> frequently found himself holding the balance of power when controversial <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointments divided the panel along partisan lines. His vote in committee against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 helped persuade other Southern Democrats to oppose <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, who eventually was rejected by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> also cast the deciding vote on the only other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> to the third-ranking post in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions III to a federal judgeship in south <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> was widely criticized in his home state for opposing both <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and Sessions, but his popularity does not appear to have waned in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> despite the increasingly tendency in recent years of the state's voters to support Republican candidates. During his first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign in 1978, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> was so popular that then-Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> decided not to challenge him. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> carried all but five of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s 69 counties in the Democratic primary, and won move than 90 percent of the general election vote. He was re-elected in 1984 with 63 percent of the vote over a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman. His only announced challenger in 1990 is state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabiness </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, a businessman who chaired the state's delegation to the Republican convention that nominated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president.

 An Iranian trade fair has successfully introduced merchandise from the Islamic state to the Lebanese market, drawing 100,000 visitors and selling $ 60,000 worth of goods a day. `` Many deals have been struck between Iranian companies and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> businessmen, both Christian and Moslem,'' said <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaferian </PERSON>, director of the `` Second Trade Exhibition of the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' `` I can not give you a final figure, but I can assure you that the number is large,'' he added. <PERSON> Zaferian </PERSON> said 70 companies are participating in the fair that opened Feb. 20 at a hotel in a Syrian-controlled district of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It ends Tuesday. He refused to say whether the fair had political motives, such as supporting the 1 million Shiite Moslems who make up <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest single sect `` I only answer questions related to the commercial aspect,'' <PERSON> Zaferian </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its mainly Shiite Moslem population back the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, militia which seeks to set up an Islamic state modeled on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> intermittently fought fierce battles from April until January against <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>, its Syrian-backed rival. After 500 people were killed, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> brokered a truce that currently is holding. At the entrance to the fair, Iranian flags and huge portraits of revolutionary patriarch <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> contrast sharply with other events at the seaside hotel: a cheese and wine party and a Greek night. Cheap prices make the Iranian goods attractive not only to Shiites, but also to other low-income and middle-income groups. People flock to the exhibition, where an air conditioner is priced at $ 90, a gas stove at $ 39 and a pair of tennis shoes costs $ 2. The fair may mark a breakthrough for Iranian-made products in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, despite their mediocre quality. Nobody seemed to mind the long wait to park in the hotel's spacious grounds, or meticulous security checks `` It's worth it. I can not afford to pay $ 40 for a pair of jeans. Here, it's only $ 7,'' said a woman who identified herself as <PERSON> Soha </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem. `` The quality may not be the same as French designer ones, but we're living through hard days and jeans are jeans.'' A fair salesman said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s first trade exhibition in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year provided an opportunity to assess the market. ` That was just an exhibition. People could not purchase any of the products. But it helped make this year's exhibition successful,'' said the salesman, who refused to give his name. Cars assembled in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were popular, with prices ranging from $ 4,200 for a <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> 5 to $ 13,000 for a Range Rover. A government education stand was one of the fair's biggest, boasting a bookshop, a children's corner and a video room playing an Iranian film, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>.'' The film showed Iranian jets mounting an attack against bases in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Jubilant crowds watching the movie shouted `` Allaho Akbar!'' -LRB- `` God is Great!'' -RRB- as the jets unleashed their bombs. Wealthier people also attended the fair, but for different goods. `` I came here to look at the silk carpets and buy some caviar and pistachio nuts,'' said a woman whose hand glittered with diamond rings. These luxuries are the only Iranian goods imported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> regularly, although the trade is minimal. A silk carpet runner measuring a bit more than 5 feet by 3 feet cost $ 1,827, and two pounds of caviar sold for $ 200. `` The caviar shelves were wiped -LRB- clean -RRB- during the first few days,'' said <PERSON> Zaferian </PERSON>. `` People would buy it here for $ 200 and sell it outside for at least double the price.''

<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> appealed Monday for a ban on ozone-depleting chemicals and said it is up to developed countries to help repair the damage those chemicals have caused to the Earth's environment The heir to the British throne said people around the world are looking to their leaders to take bold decisions to save the environment `` and not to put off those critical decisions that will ultimately cause our grandchildren to curse us.'' He welcomed decisions by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> to try to ban chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the end of the century but said `` I fear even that will be 10 years too late.'' Earlier Monday, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it needed more scientific evidence that CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it would agree to speed up its phaseout of such chemicals. `` We think that any decisions taken ... should be well-grounded and should have a firm scientific basis,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet delegation at a 120-nation conference on the ozone layer. `` If we take a decision which is not well-grounded we can interfere and destroy the economies of the eveloping countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, an atmospheric chemist from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, said, `` They -LRB- the Soviets -RRB- sound very much like people from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> a year ago and from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> two years ago'' before they became aware of the problem. Most Western scientists agree that chlorofluorocarbons, commonly used in refrigerators, aerosols and fast-food packaging, are gradually depleting the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. The compounds also trap heat, warming the Earth's surface and causing potentially major climate changes, a process known as the `` Greenhouse Effect.'' Scientific expeditions to the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> have pinpointed the compounds as the cause of an ozone hole about the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Preliminary Soviet data suggests an ozone depletion of about 25 percent over parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and as far into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozone protection. The Soviet delegation could not provide a map showing the boundaries of this area, which it said was caused by cyclones, not the compounds. <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> said the area could not be described as an ozone hole. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is among the 31 nations that have signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol agreeing to halve the compounds by 1999. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have said they will try for a total ban by that time. `` If there is proved scientific data that we should phase out these substances, we will support this idea,'' <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have such proof yet.'' However, <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>'s interpreter said the Soviet delegate personally favors quicker action. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> now produces 130,000 tons of the compounds a year, he said, about 10 percent of total world production. His country remains committed to halving that by 1999, <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> said, acknowledging `` it will cost a lot of money.'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, ozone campaign chairman for the Friends of the Earth-USA environmental group, said the Soviets were trying to `` buy themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy. ... The science is clearly there. ... It's not certain to me how they do n't have a clear picture when the rest of the world seems to be quite convinced that we need to go for a phase-out.'' Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> called for the industrialized countries, which use the vast majority of the compounds, to establish a fund to help developing nations acquire the technology to replace the compounds. Z.R. <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s environment minister, said the fund should not cut into aid to fight poverty. `` Any reduction in these resources for whatever reason would mean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for the promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' he said. `` Today, the poor are no more prepared to wait and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to wait any longer.''

<HEAD>Claim Japanese Fuel Headed to Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An environmental group charged Monday that spent nuclear fuel from Japanese research reactors is en route to the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant in violation of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moratorium on such shipments. But the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> said the waste fuel shipment was authorized while the agency still had a policy of accepting the shipments. The group, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, said the secret radioactive shipment violates a six-month moratorium on reactor fuel shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, imposed by <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 1 to assess environmental risks. `` If it was too dangerous on Jan. 1, it is too dangerous on March 1,'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> <PERSON> Moglen </PERSON> said in a statement from the organization. `` At a time when the roof is falling in on the DOE weapons facilities, it should not bring more waste into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through the back door.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplies <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and several western <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries with highly enriched uranium for civilian research reactors. Until Dec. 31, in order to prevent weapons proliferation, it required that the waste fuel be returned. DOE spokeswoman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON> said the department let that policy expire so `` we could expand on an environmental assessment of our fuel receipt policy'' at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> complex. She said the spent fuel left <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on Nov. 26. `` We will have no further shipments approved after Dec. 31. Anything not authorized before Dec. 31 will not proceed until we have a new policy in effect,'' she said. She said she did not know how long the moratorium would last. According to <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, the spent fuel is on board the British-owned Pacific Sandpiper and is due in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, after a two-week voyage from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The waste ultimately is bound for <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where it will be reprocessed. <PERSON> Moglen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> will track the shipment to its destination `` to let the communities along the route know what the DOE wo n't'' tell them. Safety and environmental problems at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last spring led to the shutdown of the nation's only reactors that produce tritium and plutonium. Safety and management at all 17 nuclear weapons facilities in the country have drawn severe criticism, and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has estimated it will take $ 155 billion over three decades to clean up and modernize <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>'s weapons complexes.

Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has used the term `` common European house'' to portray <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc as having common interests because of their geographical proximity. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said, `` There was no question of any mediation discussion on either side,'' indicating the question of a possible Soviet go-between role did not come up. The 12 European Community nations, angered by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats, have recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> is a British citizen. Many Moslems charge that his novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemes their faith. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary and religious patriarch, urged Moslems to hunt down and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> did not say how <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> responded at their talks on Monday. However, his remarks indicated he is not satisfied with the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s stance on the threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has said Western countries are justified in their `` indignation'' over the matter. But Soviet officials, while not condoning the death decree, also said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> may have felt he had to denounce <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> under Islamic teachings. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last week met with Iranian officials in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, and later the Soviets offered to help cool the strife between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Western nations. In a midday speech on Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> mentioned the dispute and said no nation should try to gain an advantage from the rift. He said, in calling for international cooperation to improve conditions in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>: `` There should be no playing on any contradictions _ whether it is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s conflict with the Arabs or the difficulties in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hakan </PERSON> <PERSON> Granqvist </PERSON>, said after returning to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel was a serious insult to Moslem beliefs, state-run <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, reported Monday. <PERSON> Granqvist </PERSON> was recalled for consultations after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. The radio quoted <PERSON> Granqvist </PERSON> as saying at a meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, `` In the West, the consciousness is gradually arising that the publication is a serious insult to Moslem beliefs, and many -LRB- Western -RRB- writers and politicians now realize this.'' The Swedish Embassy also represents British interests in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is due to announce Tuesday whether it will break off relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over the <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> affair. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Granqvist </PERSON>, `` The only solution to this crisis is respect in the West for Moslems and their belief.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issued extradition orders Monday for two Argentine couples accused of taking four children from parents who were arrested and presumed executed by security forces a decade ago. During nearly two years of house arrest in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, the couples appealed lower court rulings and argued they were victims of persecution by the Argentine government of President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. The court ruling said: `` It was not proven that both couples are persecuted politically, and in accordance with the extradition treaty signed by <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> in 1889 in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, the appeals are rejected.'' `` After two years, this is very good news,'' said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s ambassador. In a domestic political development, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s main opposition party filed documents Monday seeking recognition that would allow it to enter national elections set for May 1. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, indicated it still might boycott the elections unless the provisional government of Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> changes voting laws and procedures. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> overthrew President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, a general who had ruled since 1954, in a coup Feb. 3. The kidnapping case strained relations between the neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> countries. Ambassador <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> was recalled for for several months last year after Attorney General <PERSON> Clotildo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to deny extradition. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> was dismissed Friday, a month after the coup against <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. Argentine justice and human rights officials accused Maj. <PERSON> Norberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> and retired police official <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Miara </PERSON> and their wives of taking children of alleged subversives who were imprisoned at the Campo de Mayo army base outside <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. Many children disappeared in similar fashion during the so-called `` dirty war'' against leftist subversion conducted by the military dictatorship of 1976-83. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> was a doctor at the army base and <PERSON> Miara </PERSON> was a police intelligence officer. Both fled to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> in April 1986, claiming they would not receive a fair trial in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Neither couple was required to appear in court Monday. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone he learned about the decision from a television newscast. `` We know the extradition ruling is for me and my wife, and that the situation of the kids still must be resolved,'' said <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Miara </PERSON> claims he is his children's natural father. `` We do n't know anything for sure yet. <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> said he assumed his son <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON>, 11, and daughter <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 12, would be allowed to accompany him and his wife, <PERSON> Susana </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Quijano </PERSON> said he expected the order to be carried out within within two weeks. `` The kids are resigned, very crestfallen, but they have a great strength of spirit and they think that in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> they will be able to put things right,'' <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> said. Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, an Argentine human rights group, claims <PERSON> Miara </PERSON>'s 11-year-old twin sons <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matias </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> are <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosetti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, whose parents were arrested during the `` dirty war.'' Their mother was never seen again but the father, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosetti </PERSON>, survived, was released and now is a lawyer in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. No one answered the telephone Monday at the office of <PERSON> Miara </PERSON>'s lawyer Asked for comment Monday, a spokeswoman for the Grandmothers said they expected the decision but had no formal notification of it. She would not identify the supposed biological parents of the <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> children. The group was set up in 1977 to trace the children who disappeared and were presumed killed in the anti-leftist campaign. Investigators for <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s civilian government say at least 8,960 people were killed but human rights groups put the toll nearer 30,000. According to the Grandmothers, about 300 babies were born in captivity or taken with their mothers to clandestine detention centers. The group has helped reunite about 50 children with their biological families since <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> took office in December 1983.

<TEXT>
 The mood in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> is relaxed as Italian fashion enters the 1990s. Milanese designers presenting ready-to-wear collections for fall-winter 1989-1990 this week are not forcing outlandish ideas on a reluctant public for the sake of creativity. Rather, they are content to tailor beautiful clothes in colors and styles which are attuned to the needs of the modern woman. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most flamboyant designer, <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, said that as fashion embarks on a new decade there is a need for `` looks more in keeping with the times.'' He thinks women should be free to choose between skirts and pants and to decide for themselves the length of a hemline, `` provided the fit is easy, truly comfortable, practically a home away from home.'' For the most part, the collections seen thus far on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway are helping women to do just that. Styles are mainly soft and sporty, with pants overshadowing skirts, cozy sweaters replacing fussy blouses, and myriads of generously cut jackets, big comfortable coats, and flattering capes to face up to the rigors of the winter season. Hemlines play to the needs and tastes of all, from a few short versions to the all-purpose knee length, to the calf length championed by the young. When it comes to skirts, <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, who presented his new collection Sunday night, does not practice what he preaches. His new skirt in clinging jersey is so short and tight that anyone wearing it risks being arrested for indecent exposure. For nighttime the skirt demurely descends to the ankle in black chiffon, only to be ripped up the side straight to the hip bone. <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> has always felt most at home with sombre shades of black gray and brown in keeping with the grim, smoggy skies of this northern industrial city. But no Italian can live without color, and designers have always perked up their collections with bright shades. This season is particularly vivid with the favorite palette a fall scheme of pumpkin and tangerine, plum and grape, crimson and fuchsia, apple and moss green. A wide variety of yellows and blues also turn up, as well as gaily colored prints. Never one to go along with the pack, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION>, who usually favors glitzy clothes in shimmery fabrics, showed the most somber collection seen thus far on the runway. Not only were the colors almost exclusively in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> fog shades, but the style was uncharacteristically puritanical with long wool jersey dresses or mohair skirts worn under straight three-quarter length jackets by day, and demure gray evening gowns with lace bodice and bunched tafetta skirt. In general there is much more wool than silk in next winter's fashion, another concession to a sporty practical wardrobe Best at this woolly look was queen of cashmere <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>, who had her show late Sunday. For the past decade, <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON> has been holding the working woman's banner high with soft and elegant cashmere fashion, easy to wear and easy to pack. The novelty of her collection this season is in the intricate ruffled workmanship in capes, sweaters and gowns to look like flower arrangements. Her favorite shades are rose and fuchsia, as well as her trademark white. The new casual look was no trouble for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Varty </PERSON>, the designer behind the Byblos label, popular for its young sporty style. <PERSON> Varty </PERSON> also showed Monday, the second day of the five-day <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION> ready-to-wear collections. Next winter the Byblos woman will wear cozy jackets in bright shades of purple, blue and chartreuse, with shawl collar and extra-wide sleeves in warm shearling or bulky wool, gaily printed dirndl skirts, and heavy-knit sweaters with cheery floral motifs.

 Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on Monday became the first Democrat to swing behind <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s confirmation as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, delivering a major boost to the troubled nomination a few hours after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged lawmakers to `` put aside partisanship'' in the struggle. `` I will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove himself,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said in a speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, referring to Tower's promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the Pentagon. Republican Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who has helped spearhead the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort to salvage the nomination, said <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s remarks would `` stand out as a jewel' in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate. But moments after <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>'s surprise announcement, another <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, said he would vote against confirmation because Tower would `` create more -LRB- problems -RRB- than he will solve.'' Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, emerging from an afternoon meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, said: `` We have a better chance but it's still a fight.'' The latest <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found 47 Democrats and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, either solidly opposed or leaning against confirmation and 40 Republicans and one Democrat either leaning for or supporting confirmation. The Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, who had been courted by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, cited Tower's qualifications; the `` uncertain state of the evidence'' against the nominee, specifically the allegations included in an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on the nominee; and the alcohol promise as the reasons for his decision. <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> spoke a few hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave Tower a ringing endorsement. `` I stand by this man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience. `` I stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the right man to take charge of the Pentagon.'' In addition to <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has courted Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., who labeled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower as `` unreliable'' but said he has not made a decision on the nomination `` Frankly, I think this particular <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report is basically unreliable,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said Sunday during a stop in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` I think there needs to be more fairness put into this process.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report was `` not conclusive as to whether he had a drinking problem in the 1980s that impaired his judgment on issues in his official capacities.'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> noted Tower's no-drinking pledge and said the `` primary safeguard against abuse or the breaking of his pledge is the president himself. I do n't believe that President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would allow a person to serve as secretary of defense whose conduct is a threat to national security.'' As for Tower's knowledge of defense issues, <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe I've heard anyone question his qualifications.'' Tower, in a statement, said he was `` grateful to Senator <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> for his objectivity and for the clear and lucid way in which he stated the arguments for my confirmation. He has put the issue in its proper perspective.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said he had n't read the lengthy <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report into Tower's personal life and did n't intend to He said his own decision was based on a judgment about whether Tower would `` create problems or solve problems,'' and said on balance he believed the nominee would create more than he would solve. He also cited several remarks made by Tower, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Republican Leader <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s prerogative to consent on presidential appointments Those comments were made a decade ago during a partisan struggle that erupted when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> named <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> as an arms negotiator. In his own speech to an enthusiastic Veterans of Foreign Wars audience, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> again spoke of Tower's qualifications. He asked senators to `` put partisanship aside,'' and to `` use their own experience with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as an expert on defense issues, as a former colleague and as a tough, hard-nosed negotiator to guide them.'' There remains the possibility Tower will be allowed onto the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor to answer the allegations against him, which include excessive drinkin, indiscreet behavior toward women and his lucrative consulting contracts with defense contractors. But a majority of the chamber would have to approve the appearance and a vote is unlikely before Tuesday at the earliest. Republican senators, including <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, huddled with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to discuss the option of allowing Tower on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor and other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategy to save the nomination. `` We wanted to make sure we're not missing anything or anybody,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. As he began his speech to the VFW, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to get something `` off my chest.'' `` I'm getting sick and tired of the rumors and the innuendo that are used against this decent man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` You know <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is a fellow veteran,'' he told the VFW. Meanwhile, a conservative group said it had raised $ 100,000 to finance an advertising campaign on Tower's behalf in states with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators who conservatives think might be persuaded to vote for Tower. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the group's lobbying campaign came after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week urged conservatives to generate political heat for Tower. The Tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the outset of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 11-9 along party lines to recommend that the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject the nomination.

<HEAD>Poland To Allow Production Of U.S. Film On Walesa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government will allow an American movie producer to make a film in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> about Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. A brief announcement said a state-owned studio would provide technical help for producer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Wroclaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studio </ORGANIZATION> would work with <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> on the movie `` Polonaise,'' especially on creating crowd scenes, including ones requiring 25,000 extras portraying Solidarity's birth as an independent trade union at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> in August 1980. It was not clear from the announcement if filming would take place in the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is still employed as an electrician, or at some other shipyard. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> he had not received word that filming in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> was approved. He said he was approached last month at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gathering by represenatives of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official film agency and they offered to let him shoot portions of the movie at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> yard. `` They came and had read the script and realized what it's about and they were interested, whether because of the new government or the whole glasnost thing or whatever,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. He referred to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness in certain areas, which is being copied by some of the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s allies, and recent changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government. Filming is expected to begin in several months on the movie tracing the life of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize as a founder of the first free union movement in the Soviet bloc. Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and later outlawed by Parliament. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the film should be released in spring 1990. He said he visited <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> last year but never sought permission to shoot the movie in this communist country because he assumed he would be turned down. `` After all, it was about <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` He was at loggerheads with the government at the time.'' Solidarity is still banned, but after years of trying to eradicate the movment the government reversed its stand and is conducting talks with the opposition that could lead to a restoration of Solidarity's legal status and other reforms. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the film is expected to cost up to $ 15 million. He said it would be historically accurate but will dramatize some details, such as wedding-night conversations between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his wife. `` It is n't political, it's a story, a drama of a hero, a hero who had certain shortcomings and realized them,'' <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. `` Winning the Nobel prize is a symbol one man can make a difference and that's the message of the film, not politics. `` Polonaise,'' named for one of the works of the Polish composer <PERSON> Chopin </PERSON>, follows other films on social issues by the 74-year-old <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>. They include `` Judgment at Nuremberg'' and `` Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. While Solidarity's story is mainly one of struggle against the communist government, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the film does not portray the authorities as villains. `` They do n't look too bad for the simple reason that they did n't look too bad during the real thing,'' he said `` Even though he -LRB- <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> -RRB- was taken into custody a number of times, they could n't do anything to him because he was untouchable.'' The screenplay was written by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taradash </PERSON>, who won an Academy Award in 1953 for the screenplay of `` From Here to Eternity.'' Film Polski, the official agency, will be paid to arrange for the filming in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> but will not have a role in writing or producing the move and will not share in the profits, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> canceled a meeting Monday with the government in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after authorities refused to accept former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> as part of its six-man delegation.

CTK did not spell out the condition. The Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> monitors human rights in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Its delegation, led by <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenberg </PERSON>, was scheduled to meet with officials in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to discuss human rights in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the Federation. He helped lead <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 1968 reform movement that was crushed that year by a Soviet-led invasion and was a signer of the Charter 77 document on human rights in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenberg </PERSON> told Czechoslovak Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> in a letter made available to news media, `` We wish to express our disappointment and grave concern about the refusal of Czechoslovak ministers to meet with us.'' He referred to the authorities' rejection of <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON> as a member of the Federation delegation and the Federation's cancellation of Monday's meeting. In behalf of the Federation, <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenberg </PERSON> protested `` police brutality in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> against citizens engaged in peaceful demonstrations during August, October and January.'' He protested the trials and sentencing of rights activists in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, including prominent playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrova </PERSON>, both members of the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The Federation demanded immediate release of all political prisoners, guarantees of due process, and an end to using visa and passport regulations as a punishment for political activities.

<HEAD>Group To Import Drugs For AIDS Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A drug buyers club announced plans Monday to provide American AIDS patients with prescription drugs from abroad that have not been approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The People with <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said it would rely on foreign doctors to obtain the prescription drugs, then pass them along at cost to AIDS patients. To get a three-month supply of a drug, an AIDS patient must present a physician's prescription or note, group officials said at a news conference. Although they described the plan as unprecedented, they said it would not violate Food and Drug Administration rules. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it would allow people with life-threatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved drugs. But until now the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> group and other buyers clubs have only imported drugs that do nt require a prescription in the foreign country. Anyone wishing to legally obtain such drugs had to travel abroad and get a prescription from a physician there. `` We're saving people the trip and the importation expenses,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Callen </PERSON>, a founder of the group. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, has declined to say if his agency would try to stop the drug importation effort, but said any action probably would depend on what drugs the group imports and how it does so. One will be fluconazole, which has been approved by several European nations as an anti-fungal medication for use against meningitis and AIDS. It is seen by some physicians and AIDS patients as an effective yet mild alternative to amphotericin B, a drug which must be taken intravenously once a week and whose harsh side effects include shakes and fever. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> there have been 49,976 deaths from AIDS since June 1981. <PERSON> Callen </PERSON> said his group would decide which other drugs to import based on criteria such as toxicity, cost, effectiveness and availability. It is unclear how many patients might use the service, he said. Although <PERSON> Callen </PERSON> said the group would try to keep drug costs as low as possible, some AIDS remedies are relatively expensive. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutchnik </PERSON>, an AIDS patient whom the group supplied with fluconazole, said a daily dosage cost about $ 23, and was not covered by insurance because it was not FDA-approved. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Monday quoted group officials as saying they would obtain the drugs through foreign doctors. But <PERSON> Callen </PERSON> said at the news conference that they had decided `` not to be fully forthcoming about our precise means'' of importation. One possibility, he said, would be to put a patient directly in touch with a foreign physician who would send the drug. AIDS patient advocates have criticized the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for being overly cautious about approving AIDS drugs, arguing that they do not have time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed controversial by the agency. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> says it has a responsibility to protect Americans from drugs that could be useless or harmful, but `` something is wrong when doctors feel compelled to send patients overseas'' to obtain drugs, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitzman </PERSON>, a physician with a large AIDS practice. He said several of his patients have gone to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to obtain fluconazole. The People with <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has been supplying about 2,000 AIDS patients with non-prescription drugs from abroad which have not been approved for use in this country.

 More than 40 prominent scientists have joined the movement among Chinese intellectuals for greater democracy and the release of political prisoners, a spokesman for the group said Monday. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Liangying </PERSON>, a scientific historian at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, said 42 people signed a letter urging <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top leaders to guarantee freedom of speech, publication and information. `` This is the only reliable guarantee of unity and stability,'' the letter said, referring to government fears that democracy could bring instability. `` World history and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s experience shows that political democratization, including a legal system, is necessary to guarantee economic reform and the whole modernization -LRB- program -RRB-,'' the scientists said. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said he mailed copies last week to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, an advisory body of intellectuals It was the third letter of its kind sent to the leadership this year. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, first proposed amnesty in a letter to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> in January. Thirty-three intellectuals, including some of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous writers and philosphers, signed a letter with the same message in February. Hundreds of people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, as well as Chinese living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have signed petitions and letters of support for an amnesty. Specific requests were made in the first two letters for the release of <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, who was convicted of counterrevolutionary activities in 1979 and is said to have become mentally ill. No names were mentioned in the scientists' letter, which appealed for the release of `` all young people who were convicted and sentenced to labor reform because of ideological problems. It said that would `` open a new era in the political history of our country.'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said he helped write the letter and the signers believed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` should n't arrest people because they have different political views.'' Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said calls for amnesty amounted to `` interfering in the administration of justice.'' No other direct government response has been forthcoming, but Monday's <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily defended the imprisonment of <LOCATION> Wei </LOCATION>. `` Freedom of speech in any country can not be held to be above the country's basic interests,'' it declared. `` People have the freedom of speech but not the freedom of agitating for counterrevolution by taking advantage of socialist democracy.'' Among signers of the latest letter were <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganchang </PERSON>, a former vice minister of nuclear industry, and physicist <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingjiao </PERSON>. Many intellectuals have learned caution from four decades of alternating thaws and freezes on freedom of expression, but increasing numbers now are speaking out on political and economic issues. They say they are disillusioned by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s continued backwardness and poverty and believe a free exchange of ideas is necessary to modernizaton. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who last week was barred from a dinner given by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has encouraged intellectuals to press for democratic reform. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders say their priority is stability. Party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his two-day visit that multi-party democracy is not suitable for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and efforts to promote it will endanger economic reform.

 A senior British official on Monday sharply criticized <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders and suggested that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members help prepare for <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks _ a proposal made recently by Soviet officials. `` We think that there may be preparatory work that can be done among the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s minister of state for foreign affairs. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last month suggested that the five permanent members should meet to discuss how to arrange a U.N.-sponsored peace conference that has been endorsed by the Arab states, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other nations. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> Monday after six days in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Jordan-British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> did not refer explicitly to the Soviet proposal. He repeatedly criticized the hard-line stands taken by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. The Arabs favor a conference attended by the five permanent members as well as all the parties to the conflict. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have warily endorsed the idea of an international conference, but only if it leads to direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab foes. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejects such a conference. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is now an economic superpower greater than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has deep interests in the region. He indicated Europeans should be represented in peace efforts, saying the `` best way forward'' was through a conference involving powers with legitimate interests in the region _ a reference both to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members and European states. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s description of the occupied territories as `` liberated'' was `` simply bizarre, to use a British understatement.'' `` My visit to <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> -LRB- on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- under curfew brought home to me forcibly that the territories are indeed under complete and thorough military occupation.'' He quoted British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> as saying that the occupation `` can only be temporary,'' and cited the Palestinian uprising in which more than 380 Palestinians and at least 17 Israelis have died. `` If the way to peace is not found soon, a worse conflagration will ignite,'' <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have made their painful concession,'' he said. `` That is why the world community is saying to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, must say to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the time has now come for you to respond.'' In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told three high-ranking West European officials on Monday that now is not the right time for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to launch a new initiative in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or for a peace conference on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with foreign ministers <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Ordonez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Karolos </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The three-man group, representing the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, has spearheaded a drive for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace negotiations on the theory the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have taken a more moderate stance toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told them `` there is a need to proceed carefully'' and that the time is not right to push for a conference, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Ariane Launches Two Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 29th Ariane rocket lifted off successfully Monday from this South American launch center and put a Japanese and a European satellite into orbit. The launch had been scheduled for Feb. 28 but was postponed because of a strike by technicians. It was rescheduled for Saturday but delayed again when high winds caused two `` umbilical cables'' to disconnect as the gantry was being pulled away. Seventeen minutes, 41 seconds after liftoff at 8:29 p.m., the Ariane 4 attained orbit, and after seven more minutes it had released the two satellites. Ariane 4 is the most powerful launcher in the Ariane series. Put into orbit were JCSAT-1, a Japanese commercial communication satellite, and MOP-1, a European meteorological satellite. The JDSAT-1, built by <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s first commercial communication satellite. MOP-1 is the fourth weather satellite for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It will send weather pictures every half hour to stations on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It was the agency's second launch this year and the 11th straight successful operation. The first Ariane rocket, an Ariane 1, was launched a decade ago. The agency has had four failed flights since its rocket became operational. The last failure was in 1986 and resulted in a delay in the program of more than a year. Launches resumed in September

 Plans by pilots for nearly all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to strictly fly by the rule book starting Tuesday could cause lengthy flight delays, especially where there is heavy traffic and bad weather, according to aviation experts and pilots. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> announced the action by its 40,000 members as a show of support for 8,500 striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members and the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and flight stewardesses who have refused to cross the picket lines. Pilots, in announcing the action, said it would not amount to a `` slowdown,'' because they would simply be following procedures, taking the longer option when there are two or more safe options available. The primary impact could come if pilots rely on instrument landing procedures when they could use visual procedures, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said it was impossible to tell how much the pilots' action would affect overall air travel He said in some instances, the impact might be minimal and in areas where weather is bad and traffic heavy, it could be greater. Pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON>, who has been flying for Eastern for 19 years, said he viewed the action as `` a morale booster'' from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots who are honoring the pickets but doubted it would cause significant tie ups. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, spokesman for picketing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said the action could enhance safety in a time when several airlines have beefed up routes normally flown by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, using pilots unfamiliar with the routes. `` What you want to do is be sure the public is protected. We want to be sure the crews know where they're going ... so the approaches are made safely,'' said <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. One thing pilots might do is require air traffic controllers to read back flight plans for verification, rather than simply giving an acknowledgement that they have heard the pilot's intentions. `` They'll make sure every ` t' is crossed and every ` i' dotted,'' said a government official who is a pilot. The official, who asked not to be identified, said pilots likely would be taking the `` most conservative and time-consuming way'' whenever possible. The official said this might not necessarily enhance safety, because tie-ups at crowded airports could lead to increased frustration. `` It's a matter of a few seconds here and a few seconds there, and it could really cascade,'' the official said.

 The presidential election scheduled this month can not be postponed as suggested by leftist rebels, the president of the legislature said Monday. `` Just like they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- do not accept the March 19 date for whatever reasons, we do not accept any change in the date, because constitutionally the date can not be changed,'' <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarenga </PERSON> told journalists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. His remarks appeared to quash any prospect that an election delay could be a first step toward ending the 9-year-old civil war. On Jan. 24, the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> offered to take part in the presidential election and respect its outcome if it were postponed until September and if security and anti-fraud conditions were met. The guerrillas had rejected all previous elections this decade as sham. The government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, suggested the election be delayed by six weeks rather than six months. The rebels said that was insufficient. The single-chamber legislature has virtual veto power over any postponement and is controlled by the opposition rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance, known as ARENA, is favored to win the presidential election and has rejected any postponement of the vote. The constitution says the election must be held at least two months before a new government takes office. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s term ends on June 1. The Christian Democrats have said elections could be legally postponed and an interim president named by the legislature if a political consensus to do so exists. The <PERSON> Farabundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> on Saturday said direct talks with the government on their proposal must be held Tuesday and Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital. It repeated its accusation that the government was procrastinating. The civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

 A program that allowed convicts time away from prison was suspended Monday by Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> after an inmate out on an eight-hour pass allegedly bludgeoned his former wife to death while neighbors watched. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said two corrections officers were suspended in connection with the furlough of <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, 38, from the <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Reformatory at <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>. `` Clearly, mistakes were made, there's no doubt about that, and I'm good and mad about it,'' <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was being held Monday on a preliminary charge of murder in Saturday's death of his ex-wife, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON>, 29, in <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state line. Officers said she was beaten to death with the butt of a shotgun. He had been serving an eight-year sentence for beating <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> two years ago. The two were divorced in 1985, police said Monday. Prison officials said <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> was released from the light-medium security <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION> to the custody of his mother, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON>, Saturday morning and his freedom was supposed to be limited to the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> area. `` I understand proper procedures were not followed, and we're going to find out why that happened, discipline those who were involved, re-evaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense,'' <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said At a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference later Monday, he announced the suspension of the two corrections officers pending an investigation into their approval of a pass for <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Overstreet </PERSON> said he would not identify the workers because they had not yet been notified. The governor said former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> would head a <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> internal investigation. A report is due Friday. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said earlier he thought that proper procedure was for a victim to be notified that his or her attacker was being released. But <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON>, supervisor of work release services for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, said policy calls for victims such as <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> to be notified of a release only if they had previously requested such notification. <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON> did not know if <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> had made such a request. `` Some victims are not that concerned about it, some victims move and are very difficult to get in touch with, and sometimes we do n't even have an easily identifiable victim,'' he said <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON> also defended the programs. `` We for the most part have been enjoying a successful track record,'' <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON> said. Succeeding in either program means the offender has not been returned to the institution after his full release, <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nation </PERSON> said no inmates involved in the special assignment program will receive a pass for the next four weeks while the policy is reviewed. <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said the review would determine whether the program `` deserves to be continued or whether we should eliminate it entirely.'' <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> got the pass under a program that sends inmates at state expense to work for <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>, a not-for-profit organization that refurbishes hoouses and sells them to low - and middle-income families, <PERSON> Meloy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said he was aware of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s Regulated Community Assignment program and work-release program, but he was unaware of the special release program that allowed <PERSON> Matheney </PERSON> an eight-hour pass. `` In fact, I have some serious doubts about this program because it does not help significantly with the overcrowding situtation in the prison. It is not related to work-release activities which prepare inmates for meeting full employment in the private sector. `` This is used, as I understand it, as a tool to promote good behavior in the prison walls. And it seems to me that there may be some other less risky methods to make that possible,'' <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Defend Actions In Diabetic's Arrest For Drunken Driving</HEAD>

 Police on Monday denied allegations that they beat a diabetic man who went into insulin shock while driving his car and was arrested for drunken driving. `` The police probably should have checked a little closer,'' Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. `` But they had a lot of other concerns at the time, mainly that this guy did n't fall down and hurt himself.'' <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 63, sustained bruises to his face, hip and arms. He said he does n't remember much of what happened in the incident Friday because of his condition, but remembers being `` roughed up pretty good'' and telling police he needed insulin. He said police should have diagnosed his problem sooner and that they mistreated him by handcuffing him and putting him in a holding cell. At a news conference, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> defended his officers' actions and said a preliminary investigation showed no evidence of brutality or excessive force. He said the bruises to <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>'s arms and wrists were caused when officers tried to handcuff him. He added that <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> bruises easily because of medication he takes for a heart condition. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> may have contributed to discoloration around his eyes by rubbing them a lot, but added that he also fell and hit his eye on a file cabinet in the police station. The incident began when <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> allegedly made an improper turn at an intersection and his pickup was hit by a car. He drove away, and police were notified of a hit-and-run accident. Officers later found <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> and his car in a stranger's driveway. Police said they did not notice a necklace <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> wore under his shirt identifying him as a diabetic or a similar identification card in his wallet. They noticed a medical bracelet he wore which said he suffered from a heart ailment but mentioned nothing about diabetes. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> refused to take a sobriety test, but later tests showed he had no alcohol in his blood. Officers said they asked <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> on the way to the station if he needed medical attention and he said no. Police reports say <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was uncooperative at the police station, exhibited mood swings and was handcuffed to a bench in a holding cell. An officer found him unconscious in that cell some 80 minutes later and he was rushed to a hospital, where glucose injections revived him. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> probably would not be charged in the traffic accident because he was unaware of what he was doing at the time.

<HEAD>Reports Hundreds of Haitians Seized Boats to Sail to U.S.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Hundreds of impoverished Haitians seized boats over the weekend in efforts to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a rumored change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration politicies, a radio station reported Monday. The independent station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said at least five cases of `` piracy'' were reported after people tried to seize sailboats and small cargo ships in the harbors of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> <PERSON> Goave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>. It said one body washed ashore after a commandeered boat foundered on a reef. Craft carrying 183 Haitians were stopped at sea by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels, and the people were being returned to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the report said. The rumor suggested that immigration authorities in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had relaxed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residency requirements, and that would improve the chances of Haitians seeking refuge in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration official in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, speaking on condition he not be identified, said he was not aware of any change in residency requirements for Haitians. Radio Metropole gave this account of the various incidents: Early Saturday a group of armed men including at least six soldiers boarded a cargo ship in <LOCATION> Petit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Goave </LOCATION>, tied up the crew and ordered the captain to take them to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The ship struck a reef and was abandoned. A soldier and three other men allegedly involved in the takeover were arrested later Saturday by Petit Goave police, and the body of an unidentified man was found on the shore. On Saturday night, a yacht docked in Petit Goave harbor was stolen, presumably by members of the shipwrecked group, and the vessel has not been recovered. Police, moving to block the possible seizure of boats, arrested 30 Haitians on a dock in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>'s Cite Soleil slum district. The report about the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> stopping Haitians en route to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> said only that 183 people were picked up and were being returned to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, in reports on three incidents, said 154 Haitians were apprehended Sunday and Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said the Honduran coastal freighter <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> was intercepted Sunday 40 miles from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, and 36 Haitians were transferred to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter. He said the Haitian government suspected three of its soldiers hijacked the 250-foot freighter out of <LOCATION> Mirgoane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, Saturday night. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> reported the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s captain said eight others aboard the freighter were either crew or visitors and were not involved in the takeover. While dealing with the Haitians from the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter stopped a sailboat carrying 80 Haitians, and they also were taken aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said 38 more Haitians were picked up Monday in a 30-foot sailboat 17 miles east of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. More than 7,000 Haitians trying to flee their <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> homeland were apprehended in 1988 and returned to the island.

<HEAD>General Strike in Trinidad Protests IMF Conditions for Debt Relief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of workers throughout <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> struck on Monday to protest an economic austerity program and wage cuts imposed to meet <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> requirements for debt relief. Oil fields, factories and schools shut down. The trade union movement called it a `` Day of Resistance'' to protest the government's 10 percent cut in the salaries of 65,000 public workers, part of the belt-tightening measures brought on by the conditions of an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> standby loan agreement. `` The strike has affected us, but it is much better than going the way of the riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>,'' said one businessman, who spoke on condition of not being identified. He was referring to the bloody riots that rocked <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> last week after the government there imposed similar measures. No violence was reported in the English-speaking nation of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> and </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, a former British colony of 1.2 million people and the southernmost of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands, lying seven miles off <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. National Security Minister <PERSON> Selwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said 50 to 65 percent of the estimated 400,000 workers in the private and public sectors showed up for work. President <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> McCleod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oilfields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said 80 percent of the union members stayed off the job. He said the only exception was at the refinery, `` where we did not want to interrupt the complex operations there.'' Workers also struck the country's major sugar factory. The turnout at government offices and several ministries was reported at 50 percent, but at the post office and other key operations, only a 2 to 3 percent turnout was reported. Throughout the country, schools closed as teachers and students stayed home. In Port of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, plainclothes army personnel drove the buses. There were no taxis as cab drivers honored the walkout. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION>, the second largest city, there was no transportation and hardly any commercial activity. Workers earn a minimum wage of $ 500 a month. Midlevel professionals make about $ 900 monthly. Inflation has averaged 10 percent a year, but Trinidadians complain most about taxes and about high prices for many consumer items. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>'s foreign debt runs to nearly $ 1.8 billion. The government of Prime Minister H.N.R. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> received a $ 128 million standby loan from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in January to be parceled out in three payments, conditional on expenditures being cut in the public sector and other measures. The country made nearly 75 percent of its payments on the principal and interests in 1988, or about $ 350 million dollars to creditors. Payments for 1989 have not come due yet. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> says commercial creditors would only reschedule the debt repayments within the context of an <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> program. The country's economy has been hit by the world decline in oil prices.

 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and Turkish Cypriot leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> on Monday held their first session of intensive talks on reunifying the island. The talks, held under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices, lasted three hours at the home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilion </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> are to hold 10 sessions of closed-door talks over the next three weeks in preparation for a review April 5-6 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the current intensive talks are intended to examine a wide range of options on a non-binding basis. The two leaders started regular weekly meetings last September but have failed to make progress on a formula for establishing a two-state federation. The Greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong federal government, while the Turkish side supports a looser federation. The two sides reportedly also disagree over the withdrawal of Turkish troops, and the right of Greek Cypriots to return to property they fled after the 1974 Turkish invasion. In 1974, a coup by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s military junta failed on the island. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded the northern part of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, saying it was protecting the minority Turkish Cypriot community, and sent thousands of Turks to settle in the north. <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> in 1975 proclaimed the northern part of the island an independent Turkish state. The state, where an estimated 30,000 troops remain, is recognized only by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Customs officials recently stopped more than 3,000 Poles who were seeking to smuggle food into <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where they could sell it for a profit, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Monday. It attributed its report to <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON>, spokesman for the main customs office. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> did not say during what period of time the offenders were turned back. It quoted <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON> as reporting the crackdown and saying, `` We will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes completely.'' Communist authorities on Jan. 1 eased procedures to obtain passports and thousands of Poles have headed West to trade, mainly to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> where visas are not required. <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON> said Poles were allowed to take enough food for their journey, but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive amount. He said some Polish passengers on a train en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> threw food away when they saw customs officers approach. <PERSON> Janczyk </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> that in one case a Pole tried to smuggle a goat and a baby pig into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Meat has been rationed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since December 1980. Although consumers must wait in line to buy at state stores, meat also can be bought privatedly from farmers at higher prices. Trading in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is tempting to Poles because they can buy goods in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for zlotys, sell them for hard currency in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and then convert that money back into zlotys at the black-market rate for a profit.

<DATELINE>NILAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 30 mild earthquakes rocked the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on Monday, apparently causing no damage or injuries but raising concern among scientists because the jolts were centered near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>. A temblor at 2:16 p.m. that measured 4.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was followed by 32 aftershocks over magnitude 2 by 5 p.m., including a magnitude-4 .0 jolt, said <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> The two largest quakes were centered six miles west-southwest of Niland in the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, one of the state's major agricultural areas and located north of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border, <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. Quakes in the valley typically occur in swarms of dozens or hundreds. `` Hardly anyone has called, and we have no reports of damage,'' <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Skipper </PERSON> said after the main shock. `` It was one of those quakes that were fun _ just enough to jiggle you around but not strong enough to scare you. It did n't shake things off the wall,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, city manager of <LOCATION> Brawley </LOCATION> about 20 miles south of here The quake was the largest of a swarm of jolts that started several months ago in the Brawley seismic zone. It was centered 12 miles from the southern end of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> and roughly three to six miles from an extension of that fault, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>, scientist in charge of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey's <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> office. `` It's not far from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> so of course it's a concern to us any time there are earthquakes down there,'' <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. `` There's definitely communications back and forth among the scientists and the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Scientists are concerned about quakes in the <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> because of the slight possibility they might trigger larger quakes on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> emphasized the quake was not on another fault called the Extra Fault, but well south of it. That fault intersects the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>. A recent study by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lamont-Doherty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> raised the possibility that <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s next great, or magnitude-8, earthquake on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> might be triggered hours after an Extra Fault quake of magnitude 5.5 or more. The <LOCATION> Imperial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s most active seismic region. `` It's not uncommon to have earthquakes in the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> seismic zone,'' <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. `` There have been many earthquakes in the Brawley seismic zone and the big earthquake has not occurred.'' Until Monday's quake, the largest quake in the swarm was a mild one of magnitude 3.6, <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> said. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

 Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> confessed Monday that he's finding some frustrations in life outside the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, including writer's block and a home filled with cardboard packing cartons. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> looked every bit the image of a happy <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> retiree after his speech to <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, when he exited stage right with an eight-foot-long yellow surfboard under his arm. It was a gift from the school. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has signed a deal that will earn him a reported $ 5 million to $ 7 million for a pair of books, spoke about the rigors of writing to about 3,500 students and guests at the seaside Christian campus. `` I tell you, I sit there looking at those blank pages, but I want to give readers an idea what it's like in that house they drive by,'' he said, referring to the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also told students that his move from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Jan. 20 was a cross-country move much like anyone else might make. `` I'm getting rid of those cardboard cartons. They do n't tell you on the outside what's in'em,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We're still looking for a heating pad.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s talk marked his second no-fee college appearance since leaving office. He telephoned <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 27 and offered to address the students, waiving what has been reported to be a $ 50,000 per-speech fee. He told the students he had no bones to pick with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about his approach to the presidency so far. `` They are setting up their administration so I am kind of waiting to hear his declaration on programs. There is still some reorganization, some journeys he's making and he has not set a course,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` I have n't heard him say anything I disagree with.'' Ten <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> students were allowed to ask <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> questions and they ranged from policies in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to his transition into private life. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it was still difficult getting used to passing a television and hearing the voice of a newscaster saying, `` ` Today, the president ...' and I say, ` What did I do?''' Responding to one question, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agreed on economic policy. `` It would be economic disaster to raise taxes,'' the ex-president said to rousing applause.

<HEAD>Jesus Didn't Promise Second Coming, Scholars Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A group of biblical scholars agreed that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> never promised to return and usher in a new age and would have been `` appalled'' about becoming a cult figure in a new religion, the group's founder said Monday. About 100 scholars, theologians and historians discussed the teachings of the historical <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in a three-day seminar that ended Sunday. They agreed, with some dissensions, that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> did not promise a Second Coming in which he would bring a new age. Gospel writers and later followers of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> were the ones who predicted a second coming of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, most scholars participating in the Jesus Seminar said. The seminar was held in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> in the wine country about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>, 50, a New Testament expert and the seminar founder, said most of its members believe that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was a wandering sage and did not think he was divine, `` although he felt very close to God.'' <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> said the seminar's stand does not contradict the faith in God expressed in the Apostles Creed but is at odds with many traditional Christian beliefs. A fundamentalist pastor who attended the meeting called the seminar's stance `` heretical.'' `` They're robbing the church of its blessed hope,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Osos </LOCATION>. He said the impact of the group's statements ca n't be dismissed because `` our society tends to place scholars on a very high level. In one vote of 30 scholars, 26 said they strongly disagreed that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> expected to return and usher in a new age. The scholars almost unanimously agreed, though, that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> spoke the words attributed to him in which he said the kingdom of God already was present in his day. The group also voted overwhelmingly that the language used to describe the future kingdom of God in the New Testament is mythic and symbolic, and recommended that people should not believe in or look forward to the Second Coming and new age. Although there was no vote taken on the issue of whether <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> intended to start a new religion and be its central figure, the subject is key to the seminar's debates and has come up in virtually all of its nine meetings over the past four years. `` The overwhelming answer -LRB- among the seminar's scholars -RRB- is <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> had no intention of starting a new religion,'' said <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>. `` Most of the fellows think <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> led some kind of reform movement in Judaism. I'm quite certain he had no idea that a new religion would transpire or that he would become a cult figure in it. ... He would have been appalled by it.'' He said the scholars are almost unanimous that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` did n't think of himself as divine. The seminar's findings reflect what is being taught in most major universities and seminaries, said the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutner </PERSON>, a Jesuit and campus minister at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a seminar member. `` These are not maverick scholars,'' <PERSON> Beutner </PERSON> said. `` They take a very careful approach to how sayings of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> were transmitted and to the evolution of the Bible texts.'' The Jesus Seminar is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Westar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, a private, secular, research group that explores topics in the humanitites.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Monday to restore the death penalty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as the bill's chief sponsor predicted the chamber would for the first time override a promised veto by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. A successful override later this year in the Democratic-controlled Assembly would clear the way for the electric chair to be put back into use in the nation's second largest state. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> already has the death penalty. The Assembly approved the death-penalty measure 97-48 after an emotionally charged debate lasting more than five hours. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed the legislation last month, is expected to override the veto, as it has several times in the past. A successful override in the Assembly would restore the death penalty. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s electric chair, last used in 1963, has been sitting unused at <LOCATION> Greenhaven </LOCATION> state prison in <LOCATION> Stormville </LOCATION> since capital punishment in the state was eliminated by a series of court rulings. The chair, the first in the world, has already been used to execute 695 people since its introduction in 1890. Two death penalty supporters were absent from the Assembly on Monday. Had they been present, there would have been 99 `` yes'' votes in the 150-member Assembly. A veto override requires 100 votes. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has promised to veto the bill, making it the seventh year in a row the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor has quashed capital punishment legislation. <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, the bill's chief Assembly sponsor, predicted he would have the extra vote required by the time the override attempt comes later this year. State lawmakers have approved death penalty legislation in the last 12 years, but <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> repeatedly vetoed it. <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> area Democrat, closed in on the 100-vote override margin when longtime death penalty opponent <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, also a Democrat, announced he would vote for <PERSON> Graber </PERSON>'s bill. <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, citing the highly publicized assassination last year in his district of Police Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryne </PERSON> by associates of a drug dealer, said a poll of his constituents found that 73 percent supported the death penalty. The vote came less than a week after a federal narcotics agent and a city policeman were shot to death in separate incidents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Before the debate, about 150 anti-death penalty demonstrators, many from a Hutterite religious community near <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, gathered outside the Assembly chamber and sang such traditional protest songs as `` We Shall Overcome.'' `` No person is allowed to take the life of another person, for whatever reason,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldner </PERSON>, a member of the Hutterite community in <LOCATION> Rifton </LOCATION>. `` Only God can do that. We feel God should be the judge.'' During the debate, <PERSON> Graber </PERSON> noted that the number of murders in the state last year rose to 2,225, an increase of 213 from 1987. Pointing out that most of the 1988 killings occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he read off a list of the 20 most dangerous Assembly district in the state, including <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>'s. All were in the city and all but one were represented by legislators who had voted against the death penalty bill previously. Under the bill, the most cold-blooded murderers _ paid hit-men, killers of police officers, those murdering witnesses and the like _ would be subject to the death penalty. Once a murder verdict was delivered, a second jury would be asked to decide whether the death penalty should be imposed.

 A vast weather system dumping up to 16 inches of snow virtually shut down eastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Monday in one of that area's worst March storms on record, and it also blew snow all the way to the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and caused flooding in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>. Hundreds of schools were closed by snow or high water in 10 states and travelers were snowbound in airports and in towns along highways. The weather was blamed for at least 12 deaths, including one person killed by what the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said was high wind in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Sunday when thunderstorms battered the Southeast. It also was blamed for millions of dollars in losses for poultry farmers in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where birds were killed when the weight of snow collapsed their buildings. Snow in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> forced President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cancel a trip to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Tuesday, where he had planned to visit schools to talk about drugs and meet with Amish and Mennonite leaders in the area. The widespread precipitation was caused by moist air welling up from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and sliding over cold air from the north, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. In that mass of icy air, record lows Monday included <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 20; <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 27; <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, 10 below zero; <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, 17 below zero; <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, 25; <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, 24; and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 8. The heaviest snowfall was in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where 16 inches fell in the <LOCATION> Pauls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area south of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pauls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the snow had `` drifted halfway up the door,'' and drifts up to 6 feet high were reported on some roads around the state. Eastern Missouri got up to 14 inches of snow. Weather Service meteorologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldt </PERSON> said the 11 inches in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area was the third heaviest accumulation for 24 hours in March since record-keeping began in 1874. The Missouri State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> canceled Monday's and Tuesday morning's sessions. Northern Arkansas got up to a foot of snow, collapsing some roofs and causing millions of dollars in damage to poultry houses. In <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, part of the roof of an unoccupied kindergarten center collapsed and a bowling alley was destroyed. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., asked federal officials to help <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> poultry farmers and others who suffered damage from the storm <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> suffered more than $ 15 million in losses, including the loss of more than 150 breeder facilities, broiler farms and turkey farms. Up to 11 inches fell over the weekend in northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and part of a fire station roof collapsed at <LOCATION> Bowie </LOCATION>, 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, where wind piled the snow into drifts up to 7 feet high. Central Illinois got up to 10 inches of snow and lesser amounts extended eastward through <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Schools were closed Monday in parts of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Some junior colleges closed in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where most public schools were closed by a state holiday. Icy pavement and blowing snow made travel nearly impossible in many areas. In <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, 328 travelers spent the night in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armory </ORGANIZATION> and the civic auditorium, said <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>. About 75 people took refuge at a church in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` I've got a lobby full of people wanting rooms, and I'm full and it's blowing like crazy,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sallisaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> `` They ca n't hold their trucks and vehicles on the highway.'' All the motel rooms in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, were filled while motorists waited out the storm along Interstate 44, west of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Officials at <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said air traffic had nearly come to a halt. <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which accounts for more than 85 percent of <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON>'s traffic, said all departing flights were canceled Monday. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> said some arriving flights made it in but ran late. <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> closed every 20 minutes so plows could clear the main runway, said operations coordinator <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Blickensderfer </PERSON>. Rain caused flooding that forced the evacuation of more than 300 people in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, including 200 Girl Scouts moved from their camp in <LOCATION> Cheatham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said County Executive <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>. The rain also pushed streams out of their banks across southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, closing roads in 14 counties, canceling school in several counties and forcing some evacuations, state and local officials said. Flash flood were reported around the state and several rivers in the northern part of the state were expected to crest above flood stage during the night. All four lanes of Interstate 79 were closed by high water at <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lew </PERSON>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, said state <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Melling </PERSON> She said the department's district headquarters in the area also was evacuated In <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, classes were closed early but school buses were unable to complete their routes, stranding about 100 students at <ORGANIZATION> Minora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and 22 at <ORGANIZATION> Arnoldsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's been a mess,'' said Minora principal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Queen </PERSON>. Weather-related deaths included one in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, from high wind; five in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, two on icy roads, one in a sledding accident and two apparently from the cold; two in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, on icy roads; two in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, one by exposure and one on an icy road; and two in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, from a fire started by lightning. Tornadoes in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> caused damage to homes and businesses totaling more than $ 2 million, said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 87 homes damaged, he said two residences and four mobile homes were destroyed. Of the six businesses reporting damage, four were destroyed.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier whose 11-day disappearance prompted speculation he had defected to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was charged Monday with leaving his unit without permission and violating security rules. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, returned voluntarily to his unit Saturday. He disappeared Feb. 21 from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, about 62 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The disappearance baffled military officials, who said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had been a model soldier. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> was charged with being absent without leave and for entering the half-mile-wide security zone near the communist East German border without permission, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Dye </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Corps in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Active duty <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces must have permission to enter the areas next to the border with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> also was charged with theft of a vehicle and other items, including a portable computer he took from the regimental intelligence office where he worked. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> has undergone questioning since he returned to his unit late Saturday. His disappearance prompted speculation he had defected to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because his military vehicle was found parked and undamaged near the border. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has refused to tell authorities where he was or what he was doing during his absence. `` Mr. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, on the advice of counsel, has elected not to comment to investigating authorities,'' <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had been moved to a military detention facility in <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION> to await a court-martial. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and was responsible for monitoring radar and other military signals. He has been stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since March 1988.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Doyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest advertising agencies, died Sunday at his <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> home, the agency announced Monday. He was 86. The announcement did not give the cause of <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>'s death. When the agency was formed in 1949, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> was named executive vice president in charge of account services. He became chairman of its executive committee in 1967, when the company had grown to become the nation's eighth largest advertising firm. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> remained on the agency's board of directors after his retirement in 1969. In 1986, <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernbach </PERSON> merged with two other large agencies, <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION> Worldwide and <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION>, to form <ORGANIZATION> Omnicom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest advertising corporations. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>'s blunt comments to co-workers and clients led many in the advertising field to refer to him as the `` man with the sandpaper charm.'' One DDB employee once said of <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, `` He is the roughest, toughest, softest man I know _ and I suspect the first two are put-ons.'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> got his first taste of the advertising world as a magazine space salesman, a job he held while attending <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at night. Although he passed his bar examination, he never practiced law. `` In those days, after you passed the bar, you went to work in a law office for $ 10 a week. I was making $ 75 a week selling space. I could n't afford to quit,'' he explained. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> served as western and eastern manager for Cosmopolitan magazine in the 1930s, and in 1936 he became the first advertising manager for a new magazine _ Look. Just before World War II, he went to work for Good Housekeeping magazine. After the Japanese attacked <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, he tried to enlist in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines but was rejected because he was too old for voluntary military service. He was 39 at the time. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> persisted and enlisted in 1942. Because of his Good Housekeeping background, the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> appointed him a mess officer. He protested and, within three weeks was reassigned and became an intelligence officer serving in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as a captain. After the war, he joined Grey Advertising and in 1949 he and <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>'s creative director, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernbach </PERSON>, decided to create their own agency along with <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON>, who was running his own small ad agency. The result was DDB. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> is survived by three children and four grandchildren.

 The first federal desegregation lawsuit ever filed against an entire state university system heads back into court Tuesday, 15 years after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> first sued <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. A special master appointed by a panel of federal judges is convening hearings on desegregation plans proposed by the state, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The panel of federal judges ruled in December that a 1981 consent decree aimed at improving Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> in order to bring more whites to them had failed miserably. Settlement talks were held Monday, but the hearings will go ahead, said the state's attorney. `` Some progress was made. There has not been total consensus in the form of a settlement,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, attorney for Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. `` And as a practical matter, even if everyone agreed on everything, we could n't get it all drawn up and written out in time to stop the hearings.'' Alumni from Southern, the nation's largest predominantly black university system, and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>, also mostly black, are fighting to keep their schools distinct from other state universities while making them equal. `` Separate but equal has another connotation, so I would n't describe it in those words,'' said <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Spikes </PERSON>, president of Southern `` I think what Southern is asking for is the same thing that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is asking for _ a desegregated system, but one that still allows for access and a chance for reasonable success for minority students, poor students, and disadvantaged students,'' she said. `` That's part of the mission of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; we're asking that remain intact. The problem that must be corrected, supporters say, is that Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> never got the money and programs needed to catch up academically to other schools. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, was appointed special master in the case to draw up a desegregation plan because attorneys for 13 universities, four governing boards, the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were unable to agree on one. The first day of hearings comes one week before the suit's 15th anniversary; <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> has said they must end by March 15, the day after that anniversary. <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> campuses of the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION> system remain almost all white, while Southern's campuses in those cities remain nearly all black The same is true of <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, about eight miles down Interstate 20. Southern contends that <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, not the agreement, failed miserably. The state says it spent more than $ 200 million to upgrade the black schools. Southern contends the total spent on black schools was closer to $ 75 million. <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> and Tech are among nine schools run by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, and the state's proposal includes <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> However, the <ORGANIZATION> Grambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has proposed its own plan. Although the <ORGANIZATION> LSU </ORGANIZATION>, Southern and trustees systems all are controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, they often fight over the limited money in a state budget hit hard by the oil industry bust. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> wants to scrap the current four-board system and set up one board to run all of the schools and end the turf wars. Southern, which lost $ 5.6 million when $ 11 million in state money was cut from all colleges, would probably lose even more if this happens, supporters say. Just as important, they say, thousands of blacks left unprepared by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s woeful public schools might lose their chance at a college education. Plans submitted by Southern and by the <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> alumni depend heavily on moving programs from predominantly white schools to the black schools to make them more attractive to whites. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plan also leans heavily on transferring programs to Southern and <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION>, and calls for Southern to open new graduate schools in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>. The state's proposal calls for varying admission standards for seven of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 13 four-year universities, for cooperation among schools in the same part of the state and for a separate system of community colleges to take over the most basic courses. <PERSON> Verkuil </PERSON> already has statements from all the witnesses, plus depositions they gave to opposing lawyers. Rather than listen to arguments he's already read, he plans to jump directly from an introductory statement by state attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> into cross-examination of the state's 32 witnesses. Attorneys for the Justice, Southern and the <LOCATION> Grambling </LOCATION> alumni association each may question each state witness. After that, each must defend its own alternative to the state plan.

 Sixteen members of the Christian Knights of the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> chanted `` White power for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' as they marched Sunday afternoon through the town portrayed in the movie `` Mississippi Burning.'' About 100 people lined the streets of the north-central <LOCATION> Mississipi </LOCATION> town of 7,500 to watch the Klan demonstration. Only a handful of hecklers, some of them white, shouted at the white supremacists. About 20 Klansmen marched later in the day in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION> about 40 miles to the east. About 10 counterdemonstrators and 100 spectators turned out. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was chosen for what was billed as a Klan recruitment rally because of its portrayal in `` Mississippi Burning,'' said the Grand Dragon for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gollub </PERSON> of Picayune. The fictional movie, which received seven Oscar nominations, is loosely based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers whose bodies were found in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, 21, who was black, and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 24, who were white, were shot to death. The federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating the civil rights of the three men, but no one was ever charged with murder. The Klan group that rallied Sunday included men and women, with 10 wearing robes. <PERSON> Gollub </PERSON>'s group has marched in several <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> towns in the past few months, with <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s crowd drawing by far the largest number of spectators. The Klan planned another rally later Sunday in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. Several black leaders had asked opponents of the Klan to stay at home during Sunday's march, saying the less attention the white supremacists received, the better. The Klan members declared during their rally on the <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION> grounds that they plan to march in every <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> in efforts to attract new members. However, only a handful of people at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> took membership applications offered by the Klan members. The Klan marchers were accompanied by two police cars and six patrolmen on foot.

 Two Colombians allegedly sent here to assassinate Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and the top federal drug official in the city were secretly deported to their <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homeland, according to a report published Sunday.

<TEXT>
 The Italian ready-to-wear collections for fall and winter got off to a lively start Sunday with fashion darling <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s sporty <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> line and spoof specialist <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON>'s gag-filled winter wardrobe. Pants, in all shapes and sizes prevailed in both collections, with only a spattering of skirts. In the early 1980's, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, the leader in Italian ready-to-wear, decided to court the younger set by creating a fresh sporty line at more accessible prices. He started with designer jeans, but the label dubbed Emporio soon was manufacturing <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s trade mark blazer, suits, coats and even evening wear. Today Emporio shops designed to appeal to the young with their bright lights, trendy posters and hip music are scattered throughout <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. An Emporio Armani shop is due to open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later this month. For this year's chillier season, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, who showed his collection Sunday morning in the modern theater of his downtown Milan headquarters, plays heavily on casual, with a series of wool knit sweat pants worn under tweed blazers or matching jackets. Other trousers are super wide and cropped at the ankle, with or without cuff. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s new winter jacket is cut off above the waist. At times it has a long loose back, at others it is trimmed in demure pie-crust ruffles. His blazer is single breasted with huge breast and side pockets, a look he introduced in his more exclusive Armani label several seasons ago. There are plenty of beautiful coats to pick from for next winter, from the classic polo, to cape coats and fun furs. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> who has joined the chorus of voices calling for a ban on the use of real skins in fashion, introduced fake sables, minks and bear. To prove his point he even dotted his leather wear from shoes to purses with precious leopard spots. Evening at <LOCATION> Emporio </LOCATION> is very 1930-ish with long clinging black jersey velvet dresses, enhanced by small velvet hats complete with feather, and feather cuffed gloves. He also favors the tuxedo look from silk lapel to studs and black tie. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> has never been a bright light on the <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> runway where color is concerned and his new <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> collection is no exception. Browns grays and blacks, plus the traditional fall shades are his favorite palette, with a spatter of bright red and green for future Christmas cheer. <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON>, who also showed Sunday, was putting everything but the kitchen sink on hats, as a joke, before <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCroix </PERSON> turned potpourri hats into a multi-million dollar business. For the winter season he gets his biggest laugh out of the label racket, by flaunting labels and price tags throughout the collection. Thus a simple striped silk stole has a super visible huge white label with the designers name and the word ` couture' written on it A jacket bears the inscription embroidered in gold, `` this is very expensive,'' and a blouse states its price, also in gold. Other fashion gags at Moschino include tape measure belts, dinner jackets decorated with real forks, knives and spoons, and an Irish knit sweater with a ball of yarn and knitting needles still attached around the collar. But do n't be fooled by <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON>'s sense of humor. Behind the chuckles is a very serious designer with lots of superbly designed clothes. For next season <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> prefers pants, with wide bell bottoms to skirts, and favors long jackets with large cloth buttons. Like <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> he prefers to let the animals keep their skins opting for opulent fuzzy coats and stoles in harmless synthetic fabric.

<HEAD>Takeshita Takes Responsibility For Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took responsibility Sunday for a major political scandal that his eroded his public support, but he pledged to restore confidence by pursuing political reform, a published report said. `` The Recruit case ... surfaced during my term as prime minister so there is no way for me to escape responsibility,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was quoted as saying Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demands for the resignation of his entire Cabinet. `` I feel strongly that it is my responsibility -LRB- now -RRB- to tackle reform of the Public Election Law and the Political Funds Regulations Law in order to accurately abide with political ethics,'' he was quoted as saying during a visit to <LOCATION> Shizuoka </LOCATION>, 95 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The prime minister's remarks came one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> indicted four people on bribery charges in connection to the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stock-profiteering scandal. <PERSON> Hiromasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezoe </PERSON>, founder and former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information-employment conglomerate, was among the four arrested on Feb. 13 on charges of bribery or violation of the nation's securities exchange law Four others have also been apprehended by authorities but have yet to be charged. Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted shares of the real estate subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent figures up until September 1986. Although he has repeatedly denied direct involvement, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is among 17 politicians _ four of them from the opposition _ implicated in the stock trading scandal. An estimated 160 select individuals purchased the prelisted shares and were then able to reap large, tax-free profits shortly after they were offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986. Opposition party leaders and critics say the stock deals represent influence-buying and have stepped up demands that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign or clarify his role in the scandal. They have also called on <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who served as prime minister during the span of the Recruit stock transactions, to appear before the Japanese Parliament to answer questions regarding his part in the affair. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on Sunday said <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> had already made clear his involvment in a recent press conference but added it was up to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether to summon the former leader for questioning. Public support for the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> has dropped steadily over the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government plans to levy a 3-percent tax on all services and goods in commercial transactions, according to media polls.

<HEAD>Power Struggle Predicted Between Botha and Heir Apparent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A power struggle may break out between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his heir apparent because of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s plans to return to work after he recovers from a stroke, newspapers reported Sunday. There had been speculation that the 73-year-old president, who suffered a stroke Jan. 18, would return to office only long enough to step down with dignity and ceremony, making way for Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> indicated in an interview last week that he will come back to work in April and stay in office at least until his term expires in September. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was elected by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 2 to become the party's new leader after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned from that post. Traditionally, the party leader has been head of government, and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has found himself in an awkward position because he has no formal power over government decision-making. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was quoted in Sunday newspapers as saying he would raise the issue this week in an effort to clarify who the party wants as its top policy-maker. `` Showdown over P.W. looms,'' said a front-page headline in The Sunday Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` P.W. and F.W. Set To Clash,'' said a headline in the nationally circulated Sunday Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper. Both newspapers said many <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials hoped <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would step aside after 10 years in power, but the reports said an overt move to oust <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was seen as an unlikely last resort. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting president, Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. Calls for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s resignation have come from liberal and far-right opposition parties, as well as from some <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has yet to declare any major policy differences with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic and thus more capable of breaking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political stalemate. He and <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> have both made vague proposals to soften the impact of existing segregation laws. A national opinion poll, reported Sunday in newspapers of the Argus group, found that 47 percent of the 1,098 respondents wanted <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to step down, while 33 percent wanted him to stay in office and 20 percent were undecided. The telephone poll, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, involved randomly selected residents in six major cities nationwide. The polling firm said the margin of error for the survey was 2 percent and noted that it was not representative of the country as a whole because it was limited to people with telephones.

 Reporters, janitors and other employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> authorized union leaders Sunday to call a strike against the newspaper's management if a contract settlement was not reached soon. Bargaining talks were expected to continue up to the midnight contract expiration deadline, and perhaps into Monday if progress was made. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Graphic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 500 of the paper's 800 employees, voted 252 to 48 to allow their bargaining committee to either call a strike or extend negotiations, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a union spokesman and the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s City Hall reporter. Little progress was reported, however. `` As of what I'd heard this morning, they had not even gotten down to talking much about what the rank-and-file would consider to be the major economic issues, such as salaries and health plan,'' he said. Management representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. The paper, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, has struggled for market share against the giant <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> _ which has more than three times the circulation _ and has never recovered from a bitter, decade-long period of labor strife in the 1960s and'70s.

<TEXT>
 Government authorities thought they had the drug problem under control in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but new statistics indicate they have n't. In the past year the number of new users of `` hard'' drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, has increased dramatically and drug-related deaths have risen 52 percent to 673, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Government officials say about 80,000 people use hard drugs and that more than 100,000 drug-related crimes were committed last year. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s drug dealers are linked to an international network stretching from the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, law officials say. From <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, drug dealers operate on city streets while keeping an eye out for undercover police officers. `` Finding a fix of heroin these days is as easy as buying candy,'' said a 37-year-old <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> addict who asked to remain anonymous. `` I ca n't survive without drugs. My whole life is bad because of drugs, but knowing that makes me need a fix even more so I can feel better for at least a little while.'' Sometimes youths who have n't even reached adolescence are caught selling drugs as deadly as heroin, according to health and law officials. International health experts say they fear the situation will only worsen in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I'm very much afraid this could be the beginning of a new wave,'' Dr. <PERSON> Cees </PERSON> <PERSON> Goos </PERSON>, a specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview. West German law officials say break-ins by drug addicts as well as drug-related shootings are on the rise. Drug abuse is also tearing up relations within West German families as parents find themselves unable to bear the stress of dealing with an addicted offspring. Experts say a major reason for these problems is a worldwide decrease in street prices of hard drugs, making it more affordable for youths and others to go from marijuana or hashish to heroin or cocaine. `` You can get a gram of heroin for 120 to 200 marks -LRB- $ 65 to $ 110 -RRB-, or a one-fix street bag for 30 marks -LRB- $ 16 -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Kurt-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, a specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> Hamburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and one of the country's best-known experts in his field. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s relatively lax immigration policies have also aggravated the country's drug woes, experts say. Hundreds of thousands of newcomers stream into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> every year. Some of them take to drug-dealing to support themselves, `` The big dealers take advantage of the financial situation of the asylum-seekers and get them to sell drugs,'' said <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Metterhausen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> police spokesman and expert on the drug scene. Drug abuse in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> appeared to be leveling off after the end of the 1970s, but experts say it has made a frightening rebound. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the number of known people who took hard drugs for the first time last year increased by 38 percent, reaching 6,997. Last year's 673 deaths surpassed the previous high of 623 in 1979. No comparable figures for 1988 are available for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does n't record all drug-related deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but statistics it has compiled from 75 medical examiners in 27 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan areas showed 4,678 drug-related deaths in 1987 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a population of about 242 million people and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about 62 million. West German authorities use a combination of drug-education in schools, law enforcement, and therapy in its battle against the use of illegal substances. Newly launched methadone treatment programs in some West German cities reflect the country's ever-increasing concern about heroin addiction. West German authorities resisted such programs in previous years, saying there is no evidence it works. Methadone, a synthetic drug, has been used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to wean addicts away from heroin. Law enforcement officials have also been stepping up their efforts in the past year, hoping at least to put a dent in drug trafficking. West German authorities seized a total of 1,181 pounds of heroin last year, up 64 percent from the year before, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says.

 <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> is out to discover if she and three guests can sit around the dining-room table and have a conversation that other people will want to listen in on. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> is host of `` At <ORGANIZATION> Rona </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>,'' which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is giving a 10-show tryout this week and next. It premiered Monday and runs through March 17. Guests will include <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, among others. `` We're putting all kinds of people together, not just show-business celebrities, to see what kind of a mix works best,'' she said. `` Men and women, all women, me with all men. We'll tape it at my home in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, two shows a day. We'll serve real meals, so I guess I'll put on 10 pounds. `` I'll participate in the conversations, but I wo n't ask questions. This is not going to be a one-on-one. We're hoping we can spark some conversations and that people will react to each other. We know it works as a special but we wanted to see if the concept will work every day.'' It's the first TV appearance <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> has made, other than a stint on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> as a substitute host on `` Larry King Live,'' since she left `` Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986. She had also been an entertainment reporter for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' and `` Tomorrow'' shows and before that for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' She said `` At <PERSON> Rona </PERSON>'s'' was first tried as a special for `` Entertainment This Week.'' Her guests were <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>. The guests for the show will come from entertainment, sports, politics and business. `` We'll start when the people arrive and we serve coffee,'' she said. `` We'll say hello and get acquainted. Like any interview, it takes time for people to warm up. We'll tape the whole thing and then edit it. `` We'll try different mixes, and we want to see if you can do two shows a day and still be fresh. I want to mix people from different backgrounds and see how that works. Say a person like <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and a very interesting person from show business or politics and a very savvy woman.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said she had encountered some difficulties putting the show together. `` You'd think it would be easy to get people to come to your house for dinner,'' she said. `` It's not easy convincing people it's new and not just another interview My hope is that if it works we can bring different people and points of view together.'' Since leaving `` Entertainment Tonight'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said she has been working on original novels for television under contract to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I went to <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> with an idea called ` <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s Untold Stories,''' she said. `` Four days earlier <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had just bought <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s idea for ` Unsolved Mysteries.' Then <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> suggested that I write original novels for television.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said she did not write them as novels but as treatments for movies, which are detailed outlines. Besides being made into movies, however, they could be published as novels. She said she has three novels in various stages of development. Two are thrillers and one is a mystery. She has also sold <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a dramatic series with a commitment for a two-hour pilot. `` I'd more or less given up my other career,'' she said. `` Except for substituting for <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. Then this came along.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said the protagonists in all of her projects are women. `` I find I have a running theme in journalism and in telling stories,'' she said. `` It's a different way of telling the truth. My interest is in seeing what's really there. My thrillers are about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations that become world events. My examination is, how does this happen?''

<HEAD>Iraqi Leader Seeks Dominant Role in Arab World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who has proclaimed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the victor in the war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, now seeks a dominant role for himself in the Arab world. But <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, the name he goes by in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, faces growing resentment at home because promised economic good times are slow in coming after eight years of wartime hardship and sacrifice by his 16 million people. Salaries are low and prices are high. `` I want to get married, but I need 10,000 dinars -LRB- $ 30,000 -RRB- for an apartment, furniture, gold,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a 27-year-old soldier, referring to the three items required of any perspective Middle Eastern groom. He earns just 100 dinars -LRB- $ 300 -RRB- a month in the army. `` I want to open an auto supply store, but I have to get out of the army first,'' he said. Nevertheless, Iraqis still regard <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> as a hero and, according to diplomats in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, visiting <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders praise his strategies that led <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to sue for peace last summer. A Western military analyst said <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>'s well-equipped, 1-million-man army has made <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` a major player'' in the region. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s new economic alliance with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> _ all of whom lent men and materiel to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s war effort _ may prove the first indication of how <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> will fare as a pan-Arab leader. Other Arab countries will also be watching the extent of political and social reforms inside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Iraqis accepted many economic and political limitations as a necessary price for the war, but now that it's over, the restrictions chafe. `` Wherever you go you feel that the secret police are on your back,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 51, who works for a retail company. `` Even the traffic police can beat you. There's no personal freedom here.'' Said another Iraqi: `` There is some personal freedom, but not as much as people want.'' Restrictions like banning foreign travel, limiting imports of videos and barring foreign publications are widely resented, he said. Iraqis are forbidden to allow foreigners into their homes and even talking to them is viewed with suspicion. So Iraqis interviewed by visiting reporters usually give their first names or none at all. Certain subjects, like the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are taboo. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government officials say many of the restrictions were necessary because of the war and will be lifted gradually. `` The trend has been approved that there be more openness in the political system, including this matter of elections and other steps to improve the political and social system,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON>. `` People should expect lots of changes over the next few months.'' Elections postponed since August are now set for April, with the delay attributed to the governing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> working out laws for new political parties <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> is permitting to operate. But Iraqi officials said the plans date back to the 1968 revolution that brought the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to power. They can now be implemented because <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> came out of the war a more cohesive nation. `` Difficult conditions existed even before the war,'' said <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhtar </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` But any citizen who lived through the war is qualified to practice freedom in political life. No one who went through the war is a threat to our government. Why should we exclude them?'' The strongest opposition groups _ the Communists, the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Call </ORGANIZATION> and separatist Kurdish factions _ are excluded. All were driven underground in bloody purges. Information Minister <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayyif </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasim </PERSON> said all were `` treacherous and treasonous'' for aiding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s image was tarnished by its alleged use of chemical weapons against the Kurdish rebels last fall in a major offensive to crush the guerrillas' campaign for an autonomous homeland. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> has declared an amnesty for many prisoners and dissidents, but Kurdish officials described it as little more than cosmetic. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recently singled out <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its `` abysmal human rights record,'' mainly because of the assault on the Kurds in the northern mountains. Diplomats said easing restrictions on personal freedom will help <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> deflect the heat from economic problems expected to last at least five years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has an estimated $ 60 billion to $ 70 billion in war debts and moves to expand the private business sector and secure Arab investment have yet to make headway. Prices skyrocketed as private firms took over agriculture and importing consumer goods, leaving Iraqis feeling empty handed despite promises of postwar prosperity. Long lines form outside government meat stores when the monthly ration is distributed. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> Passat cars imported from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are the only autos widely available. One boutique owner said she spent hours scouring the market for decent buttons. `` Anything electric is very expensive. I ca n't afford them,'' said <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, 34, a veteran who was wounded seven times and lost a kidney. Blistering attacks have appeared in the press. Economist Human al-Shuma' a wrote in <ORGANIZATION> Al-Qadissiya </ORGANIZATION> that the private sector was `` soaking the sweat of the people and grabbing their daily bread.''

<HEAD>Senate Courtesy Shaken in Tower Fight</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Layer by layer, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s courtly veneer is peeling away as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s former colleagues sit in judgment of `` our distinguished friend.'' That's the way senators talk about senators, and former senators, even when the political cutlery is out. In this instance, Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, was speaking, and right after he called Tower distinguished, he called him `` Mr. <PERSON> Alcohol </PERSON> <PERSON> Abuse </PERSON>,'' saying he would not vote to confirm such a man to be secretary of defense. Senatorial courtesy is taking a beating, the niceties of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> address notwithstanding. The words of esteem are demonstrably hollow. Amid the flowery salutations come accusations of hypocrisy, of judgment by standards that are at least double and maybe more. Republicans are making a target list of Democrats who have taken campaign contributions, speechmaking fees and trip expenses from defense interests, all to counter the criticism of Tower's lucrative consulting contracts with the defense industry. That may not accomplish much because the numbers are public information anyhow, and the practice involves senators of both parties. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said the tactic is part of a Republican `` scorched earth policy.'' But so far, neither side has escalated past anonymity on the central issue of the Tower debate, the argument about excessive drinking. There have been repeated suggestions of problem drinking by others in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but never with names to make them more than rumor. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says he never saw Tower impaired by alcohol. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> pointedly declined to answer when asked whether he ever saw any other senator drunk. Tower's drinking habits are described in a secret <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, open only to senators and off-limits in floor debate. Republicans call it anonymous hearsay and innuendo; Tower's opponents say it provides clear evidence of a persistent drinking problem. But no one claims personal knowledge; no senator has said he saw John Tower drunk or even tipsy. `` I challenge any member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to come in and tell me that he has seen <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> inebriated,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. None has. `` We all heard of it,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` ... I thought he'd outgrown it. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the leading opponent of confirmation, said he never saw Tower drunk. He was senior Democrat on the committee when Tower was its chairman. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he had fully expected to vote for Tower until evidence of problem drinking and the question of defense consultant contracts came up in the confirmation investigation. In 1984, when <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after 24 years, more than 40 members took the occasion to praise his performance, especially on national defense. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said his talents were national assets. In debate on the nomination, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat said he respects Tower's knowledge, but that questions of personal conduct, discretion and judgment are at issue now. Not that sincerity ever has been one of the tests of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> oratory, especially on occasions of ceremony. Much of the farewell praise for Tower came from Democrats who are opposing him now. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> called him `` a magnificent champion'' of the armed forces. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> praised his `` strong leadership and sound head.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, uncommitted now, said Tower was one of the leading defense authorities not just in the country but in the world. `` It is sort of nice to be able to hear these nice things said about one's self in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' Tower said of the farewell speeches. `` It is almost like having the privilege of reading your own obituary ...'' Another version is being written in <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate now. `` I think part of Tower's problem is a lot of people do n't like him personally,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss. `` But that's no reason to vote against him.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> was never a member of the club,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, who supports the nomination. But these are not clubby times anyhow.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornaro </PERSON> was a pawn in superpower intrigues five centuries ago, but she ruled as queen of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> for almost 16 years and won a lasting reputation as a fascinating Renaissance personality. <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON>, a Venetian aristocrat, inspired dozens of portraits as a dark-eyed beauty, a string of biographies and five operas, including one by the Italian composer <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>. Her life story reads like a pulp romance, starting with a short-lived marriage at 18 to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastard </PERSON>, king of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, and ending with retirement near <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> presiding over a glittering salon of poets, painters and musicians. But a new book published to mark the 500th anniversary of <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON>'s enforced abdication in 1489 avoids depicting her as a tragic heroine. Instead, she comes across as a tough survivor, maneuvering to stay alive in an maelstrom of violence and political treachery between Greeks and Italians on this east Mediterranean island. According to one of the three contributors to `` <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornaro </PERSON>, Queen of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' the chroniclers' references to her as `` la bella donna'' -LRB- the beautiful lady -RRB- probably were inaccurate. `` She must have had what we would call charisma, but I do n't think she could be considered beautiful ... more a woman of character,'' <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaly </PERSON>, a British art critic and Renaissance specialist, said in an interview `` She was certainly hard-headed and realistic, and not the sad deposed queen of the sentimental legend.'' <PERSON> Mullaly </PERSON> said that none of the portraits of <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> as a young woman were definitely contemporary. The only one that dates from her lifetime, by the renowned Venetian painter <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>, shows a plump matron `` with shrewd eyes and a capable air,'' he said. <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> rose to fame when she sailed to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in September 1472 to marry <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a ruthless but popular king who seized the throne from his half-sister <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, the legitimate heir. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> died suddenly nine months later, apparently of dysentery, and so did <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON>'s infant son, both in suspicious circumstances, according to <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> historian who also contributed to the book. `` I'm convinced that both <PERSON> James </PERSON> and his son were poisoned, and the Venetians are the prime suspects,'' <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> said in an interview. The historian, who researched <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON>'s life in libraries around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, added: `` It was their favored method of assassination. They had professional poisoners on the state payroll ... and they benefited most from <PERSON> James </PERSON>' death.'' <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> had been ruled for centuries by French-speaking kings descended from the Crusaders who fought in the Holy Land. The island was coveted by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> as an important trading post for merchants dealing in silks and spices from the Orient. <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> succeeded to the throne. But she was hemmed in by her Venetian relatives and advisers who accused her of spending extravagantly. They also blocked her plans to marry <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, when she was 34 and he was 22. <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> fought back, writing letters to <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> complaining that her counsellors spoke to her rudely and failed to consult her on financial and judicial issues. In one letter, she begged the Doge of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> to strictly enforce legislation protecting Cypriot peasants from being kidnapped and forced to row Venetian galleys. She also complained she was not allowed to dine royally in public attended by young noblemen, but was permitted only a small table and two maids to serve her. But in the face of a growing threat from Ottoman <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> was finally persuaded to abdicate in 1489 and make a gift of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to the Venetian republic. In return, she got a pension of 8,000 ducats a year for life and sovereignty over the small hill town of <LOCATION> Asolo </LOCATION>, 33 miles from <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. Histories say 8,000 ducats was a comfortable royal stipend for that time. According to calculations based on the amount of gold in a ducat, the stipend would be worth around $ 450,000 today. `` The Venetians were the all-time masters of diplomacy,'' <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> said. `` They knew when to act, and <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> knew when she had to give in.'' In Asolo and her three other homes in the Veneto, <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> sponsored theatrical performances and concerts and entertained the leading intellectuals of the day. But her practical streak emerged too. She rebuilt much of Asolo, organized a lending bank and tax reforms, and even imported grain from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> during a famine. <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> died in 1510 and was buried in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>. The Venetians held on to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> until 1570, when it was captured by the Turks. `` <PERSON> Caterina </PERSON> was an extraordinary person. ... She deserves to be known for the character she really was, not the legend,'' said <PERSON> Iro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who co-edited the book with her husband, a former British High Commissioner to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>.

 In a muddy field near the Berlin Wall, a young Pole looks furtively about and pulls a bottle of vodka out of a plastic bag. `` Five marks, you can have,'' he says. He motions to a fox fur coat on a hanger clipped to button on his shirt. A bargain for 30 marks -LRB- $ 17 -RRB-, he says. If he sells four bottles of vodka at five marks -LRB- $ 2.70 -RRB- each, or the fur coat, he will have earned himself the equivalent of about a month's salary in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Across town, in the fashionable <LOCATION> Zehlendorf </LOCATION> district, three Poles are painting the interior of a handsome turn-of-the-century villa for the unbeatable price of 400 marks -LRB- $ 220 -RRB-. `` You could n't get a union painter to even look at the place for that price,'' said the homeowner, speaking only on condition of anonymity. City officials estimate that as many as 4,000 Poles sell goods or their labor illegally in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> now that entry into the city has been eased for them. Many advertize in the city's newspapers offering to do home repair work and odd jobs at prices many West Berliners find hard to resist. Thousands of Poles are also turning up on weekends at a flea-market to sell everything from baby clothes to superbly crafted amber necklaces for hard currency, such as marks and dollars. With the Polish economy in shambles, the vendors say, hard currency has become the only means to acquire quality goods and food items in short supply. It also offers the opportunity for staggering profits on the black market currency exchange at home. `` Without hard currency you ca n't get anything that's any good,'' said a 30-year-old man from <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, who drove through the night to be at the market when it opened at 5 a.m. He was among a record 8,000 Poles who jammed a field in the <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district of the city on a recent weekend. Thousands of West Berliners jostled through the mud to inspect shoes, clothing, household goods and food. The grocery goods, displayed in open suitcases and car trunks, ranged from heaps of Polish sausage to tins of Russian caviar at dumping prices. Many Poles at the market earn enough West German marks in a weekend to support them for several months. `` Ten marks on the black market in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will get you up to 20,000 zloty, or almost as much as a pension,'' said a middle-aged man from <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> who was selling crystal goblets from the trunk of his car. A companion, who said he came from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, added: `` I buy goods in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for 1,000 zloty that I can sell here for 200 marks. With those 200 marks, I can get 400,000 zloty on the black market in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. We can live for six months on that.'' A Polish house painter, who asked not to be named, said he could earn a year's wages from three months' work in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Under new regulations that went into effect Jan. 1, Poles do not need visas to enter <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and are allowed to stay as long as three months. However, they come as tourists and are prohibited from engaging in commercial enterprises. So far, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police have cracked down only on vendors illegally selling heavily taxed items such as cigarettes, furs, jewelry and alcohol. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police said that on one day alone, authorities seized 11 liters of vodka, 28,000 cigarettes, 360 grams -LRB- about 12 ounces -RRB- of caviar and two fur coats. Fourteen Polish vendors were charged with violations of import tax laws. Six Poles were arrested in February and expelled after they were caught working illegally in the city. Customs checks have also been stepped up and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has ordered that Poles caught smuggling goods be immediately expelled and the offense noted in their passports. But customs officials say tourists are allowed to bring in goods worth up to 100 marks -LRB- $ 54 -RRB- for personal use and it is often impossible to prove that the goods are intended for sale. `` There are too many of them and too few of us,'' said an exasperated customs officer as as he made his way down a row of sputtering Polish Fiats and vans at Checkpoint <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. Around the corner, where 45 cars packed to the roofs with goods waited for custom inspectection, deals were already flourishing. A West <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> walked away with a porcelain tea set for 50 marks -LRB- $ 27 -RRB-, three times less than the department store price.

<HEAD>Cape Town Wants to be South Africa's First Desegregated City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest city, wants to be the country's first completely desegregated municipality. `` We are striving toward prize No. 1, that the whole city is a free settlement area. But the government is hardly likely to do that,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>. He meant the national government. National apartheid laws allow municipalities to decide whether to open public amenities such as parks, beaches and buses. <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> is the only major city with no segregated public facilities. But the national government holds the power to segregate residential areas, schools and hospitals. The <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Council </LOCATION> has petitioned repeatedly for the right to declare its whole area, or sections of it, open to free settlement. The law prohibited multiracial neighborhoods, although parts of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and other cities are mixed, with non-whites living illegally in designated white areas. On March 2, a new law took effect that will allow multiracial neighborhoods on a limited basis. <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> believes that a section of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> will be the first area where all races can live together legally since the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislated residential segregation in 1950. `` It's common cause that District Six will be the first free settlement area,'' said <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>. He referred to a hillside near the center of town where a squalid but lively multiracial neighborhood was bulldozed in the 1960s and declared `` whites only.'' District Six is now bordered by all-white apartment blocks and a white technical school. But grass-covered lots, intersected by empty streets and dotted with mosques and churches, lie vacant because most Capetonians felt the demolition had stigmatized the area. `` Nobody with any kind of sensitivity would have taken it upon themselves to in any way develop District Six,'' said <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>. Before cities were granted the right to open public amenities to all races, the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Council </LOCATION> refused to enforce the Separate Amenities Act. Instead of signs demarcating swimming pools and toilets for `` whites'' or `` non-whites,'' <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said, the council put up notices warning `` disallowed people'' that they could be prosecuted if they broke the law. `` But we did n't prosecute,'' he said. `` Right through the 1960s we fought the removal of the colored -LRB- mixed-race -RRB- people from the voters' roll and as representatives on the Council,'' recalled the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee chairman, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON>. He was mayor in 1972 when national law forced the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to become all-white. `` We held protest meetings, we passed resolutions, we did all we could,'' <PERSON> Friedlander </PERSON> said. `` Six of the 34 councilors were legislated out of office.'' `` Some of the colored councilors were elected from predominantly white areas, and vice-versa,'' <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> said. `` We had gotten away from racial stigma.'' The people of mixed-race, <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> or Indian ancestry whose religions, customs, language and architecture contributed to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s historic and cultural attraction now have no direct voice in how the city is run. They can elect neighborhood management committees, which appoint delegates to a regional council. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> sits in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, the legislative capital. The first whites to settle in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were merchants from the Dutch <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> who established a trading post in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> in 1652. The 1985 census put the population of greater <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, including suburbs, at 1.54 million _ 433,000 whites, 839,000 coloreds, 18,000 Asiatics and 254,000 blacks. City spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Doman </PERSON> said the blacks are grossly undercounted. Officially, no blacks live in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The adjacent townships of <PERSON> Langa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nyanga </LOCATION> and Crossroads were taken from the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s control, although the city provides most of the water, sewerage and fire protection services that exist in those areas `` We feel a moral, if not a strategic, obligation to make sure those places have the highest quality of life they can expect, bearing in mind the shanty type of existence there,'' said <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> once said, in effect, that since rulers are the servants of the people, they get a promotion when they return to civilian life. So what's life like once you're evicted from the White House Here's a report on how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s four former presidents, the most alive at one time since <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was in office, adjusted to the move from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to Main Street.

 On the 34th floor of a hilltop office building in the <LOCATION> Century </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a man stands at a window with binoculars in his hand, scanning a hillside 2 -LCB- miles away. Yes, he decides, there it is. He has spotted his own house. That's something any man who has moved into a new skyscraper office and a new home might do. But this is no ordinary citizen settling into new surroundings. Until noon on Jan. 20, this man, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, headed a government with 3.1 million employees and a nation of 247 million people. He commanded more than 2.1 million Americans in uniform, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> of 565 ships, a force of 100 B-1B bombers able to strike anywhere in the world. Ambassadors represented him in 142 countries. Now commands no troops or ships or airplanes. He has no ambassadors anywhere. He has a staff of 12. `` In free governments,'' said <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, `` the rulers are the servants and the people their superiors and sovereigns. For the former therefore to return among the latter is not to degrade them but to promote them.'' Now there are four former presidents back among the people _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> _ the most alive at one time since <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> died in 1862, while <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was in office. For them, the `` promotion'' was sometimes hard to swallow. `` It was deeply discouraging for me to contemplate the unpredictable years ahead,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, back in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, after his defeat by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, recalling his own flight to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a defeated president four years earlier, said that `` halfway across the country, it was as if an invisible force had entered the plane. `` The merriment ceased ...'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, stepping down after completing the two terms to which the Constitution limits him, said his leave-taking was `` a bittersweet experience.'' `` It is going to take a little while for the dust to settle,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s longtime friend and lawyer, who returned to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1985 after more than four years as attorney general. `` He's getting along fine outwardly; inwardly there's got be a real transition adjustment ... there is no way to avoid that.'' The transition has been going on since even before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the oath of office. `` I was prepared for that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It had been on my mind for quite some time.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spoken little of his return to private life, but there have been revealing glimpses in public, and more private moments are etched in the memories of associates, some of whom spoke only on the condition that they not be identified. On the helicopter flight from the Capitol to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the departing former president remarked on how quickly the inaugural crowd had dispersed. Then, flying over the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with two long moving vans drawn up in the south driveway, he asked his wife of 36 years, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, to look down. `` There's our little bungalow, dear,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> smiled through her tears. Actually, there were few tears, but there was no joking either. `` There was n't any sense of the door closing, and no one said, ` Well, it's all over,' or anything like that,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON>, director of the president's advance team. `` I think everybody just had their own thoughts.'' At <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was treated one last time as though there were no <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Marine Corps Band from <ORGANIZATION> Quantico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, belted out a fanfare as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> went to the reviewing stand. The departing commander in chief trooped the line as honor guard units representing each of the services stood at attention. A salute gun platoon from the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Infantry sounded a 21-gun salute. A little more than an hour after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sworn in, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> took off for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> aboard the plane they had flown so often as Air Force One. Now it was SAM 27000, the correct radio designation since no sitting president was aboard. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> political consultant associated with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> since before he won the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governorship in 1966, was on the flight. `` We talked about things clear back from ` 65 on, various high points,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> recalls. `` A lot about his governor's races, of course. Nostalgia is the word I would use, not sadness.'' <PERSON> Hooley </PERSON> adds, `` It was the same old <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the end. I do n't know whether, when he gets home and closes the door, he lets out whatever emotion he wants to, but there was n't anything really measurable there, on that flight.'' The welcome for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in the balmy air of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was fit for two troupers returning to the movie capital. Comedian <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> kidded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about having to find a job. The out-of-work president joked that he'd been asked to do a remake of his 1951 movie `` Bedtime for Bonzo,'' this time playing the title role of the mean-tempered chimpanzee. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> marching band offered him their helmets to wear. It had been a trip far different from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s 15 years earlier, as recalled by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> speech writer now working in television in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, forced from office by the Watergate scandals, flew West in an atmosphere of emotional turmoil. After walking through the staff cabin trying to cheer people up, he retired to his own cabin and ordered a noontime martini, unusually early in the day for him, just as <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was taking the oath in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Shortly after he arrived at <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacifica </LOCATION>, his home at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> received a telephone call from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, then governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, welcoming him back to his home state. `` We were all very moved because it was at the lowest ebb of all our emotional tides,'' <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> recalls. For <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, too, the situation was different. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew he was leaving office and had been preparing for it for a long time. Nobody ever thinks they are going to lose an election, and then you have a much more hasty transition and departure,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, a military aide and executive assistant who accompanied <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is now his spokesman.

 <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s departure from office was colored by the dramatic announcement, moments after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was sworn in, that the hostages he had labored to free were out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and on their way home. `` The atmosphere on the plane was one of celebration,'' recalls <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON>, now in public relations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On his arrival in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was visibly weary and had a growth of stubble after two nights in the Oval Office with little sleep. Then he was whisked back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a flight to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to greet the freed hostages. `` So, in a way it was a more phased withdrawal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wexler </PERSON> says. Also, she adds, `` Because of all the tension with the hostages, it was n't so inner-directed as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> departure was.'' For families, too, the departure from the White House can be wrenching. <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 13 at the time, told her parents, `` I do n't want to go back to <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to live. You may be from the country but I'm not. I've been raised in the city.'' After a few unhappy months at home, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> did go off to boarding school in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> recalled in `` Everything to Gain,'' the book she and her husband wrote about their post-White House years. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>, now married and raising a family in suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was a 17-year-old college student registering for classes at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> on the day <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was sworn in to replace her father in the White House. `` I had left about two weeks before my parents moved out, so I just sort of left like I was going away on a trip,'' she recalls. A television tape was made, however, of her parents walking down the Capitol steps, getting in the helicopter and making the farewell flight around the city where <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had served 25 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. A musician dubbed one of Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s favorite songs, `` What I Did for Love,'' as background music. `` To this day, we still ca n't watch it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s daughter says. `` It's still a very emotional thing.'' Emotional or not, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he is looking to the future, not the past. On his 78th birthday on Feb. 6, he told students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, `` For two weeks, I tried to adjust to private life and growing old gracefully, but that's not my style.'' He repeated his pledge to campaign for repeal of the two-term limit on presidential terms, saying, `` Two times is n't necessarily enough time to get all you want done, done. I still had things to do when I left.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is one of only 11 American presidents who have lived past their 78th birthdays. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> lived the longest, both dying at 90. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has signed a book deal worth up to $ 7 million and lined up a $ 50,000-per-speech lecture contract. Although he had the help of a ghostwriter on his earlier book of memoirs, `` Where's the Rest of Me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> he will write this one himself. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spends six hours a day at his penthouse office, which is decorated with many of the same items he had in the Oval Office _ a miniature saddle, for instance, and pictures of his family. One visitor noticed a painting, still to be hung, of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' ranch north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. Aides have denied rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> plan to sell the 688-acre hideaway. His office has a view of the ocean on a clear day, but he ca n't see their pink brick house in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> from the window The ex-president had to go into his wife's office down the hall to do that. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is working on her memoirs, scheduled for publication this fall, and making appearances for the anti-drug campaign she began in the White House. A drug treatment center bearing her name is planned for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` There is really no such thing as an average day for either of us,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. `` Lunch is soup or a sandwich at my desk, and then back to work.'' Instead of getting daily briefings from his chief of staff and national security adviser, he now gets his news by reading the newspaper and watching television. Friends say he also talks to former <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> associates to get filled in on what is going on in the capital. On Jan. 26, he got a telephone call from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It began, `` What's for lunch?'' It was Thursday, the day the two men regularly had lunch in the Oval Office. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have had friends in for dinner and they go out frequently, celebrating his birthday for instance at the <LOCATION> Bistro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, where guests ranged from actress-socialite <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` They've received lots of flowers from neighbors,'' says spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. `` They've received a first-aid kit from neighbors. They have received cookies from neighborhood children.'' The Reagans often attend Bel Air Presbyterian Church, where they also worshiped when he was governor. They arrive in a limousine, with a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> car following. Other Secret Service agents arrive an hour ahead of time. They sit near the back of the church, to the left of the center aisle. The seats are selected by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, it had been decided our going to church represented a threat to too many people in these times of terrorism,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said. The first week at Bel Air Presbyterian, the Rev. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON> greeted the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> as a large crowd lined up outside to welcome them. Each week, the crowd grows smaller. `` They are going to ease back into the family and be just routine,'' says <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moomaw </PERSON>'s administrative assistant. `` That's what they want.' Meanwhile, back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, another transition has been going on _ one summed up in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post by writer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Freund </PERSON> as `` damning with tainted praise.'' `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office as a popular and much-praised man,'' <PERSON> Freund </PERSON> wrote in a Jan. 30 article. `` But he lacks one thing today that he still had 10 days ago: power. The result is that his reputation here is being dismantled, through a revealing rhetorical process, faster than are the inaugural reviewing stands for his successor.'' The process works this way. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is praised for his `` governmental expertise,'' for his `` experience,'' for his `` spontaneity.'' And every word, said <PERSON> Freund </PERSON>, `` suggests an equivalent term of opprobrium for his, by implication, detached and lackadaisical predecessor.'' `` It's kind of like you're the good guy until you leave town, and then they can jump all over you,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>. `` I do n't think my father had that problem.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> oversees a most unusual performance in a most unlikely setting. He's been doing it for 48 years, and spectators still wonder why they find it so amusing. He knows why.

 A few days before his 9th birthday, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> dared to try every boy's ultimate adventure. He ran away and joined the circus. His purpose, he says, was to escape violin lessons, not to become a performer. Yet today, a few days before his 80th birthday on March 22, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> is still going strong as the raucous ringmaster of the oldest established permanent floating animal act in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, perhaps in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and certainly one of the most charming. He's the Peabody duck man. `` I swear,'' he was saying the other day, scratching his gray head, `` I still do n't understand why people like it so much. `` You saw'em, saw how they behave. They laugh and clap and cheer and take pictures. They've been doing that for the 48 years since I've been here and were doing it before that, so I'm told. I do n't understand it, I just do it Twice a day.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> understands more than he lets on. The applause recognizes the unlikely setting for the performance, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON>'s sense of showmanship makes the most of it. Picture this: At midmorning the grand and gilded lobby of the Peabody Hotel begins to fill. The bar opens and the tinkle of ice in thin glasses mingles with the chatter of expectant guests. At 10:45 a.m. the bell captain rolls a red carpet from the elevator's brass door 50 feet to the base of the fountain in the center of the lobby beneath hand-painted beams and wrought-iron chandeliers. He places a three-step red-carpeted staircase up to the lip of the fountain. The fountain is of carved travertine marble. Four marble cherubs support a huge marble bowl of fresh water overflowing into an octagonal marble pool. Above the bowl a marble pot overflows with fresh flowers. When it comes to gilt and grandeur, the Peabody is not known to stint. At the stroke of 11 a loudspeaker announces solemnly, `` Your attention please. Ladies and gentlemen, the Peabody ducks.'' Spectators crowd into position along both sides of the red carpet. The loudspeaker strikes up `` Stars and Stripes Forever.'' All eyes turn to the polished brass elevator doors. They open with a flourish and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON>, in a voice like a trumpet, cries, `` Let's go, ducks!'' Out they come, a mallard drake leading a four-hen harem. <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> swaggers behind them in a burgundy and black uniform, carrying a stick, like a field marshal. Down the red carpet they waddle, up the red stairs, over the marble ledge, flapping and quacking into their elegant pond. Cheers. Laughter. Flashbulbs. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> has devoted more than half his long life to this twice-daily task _ the duck parade will be repeated, in reverse, precisely at 5 p.m. when they return to their penthouse palace _ and he appears more than content in his role. `` I've done lots of other things in my life,'' he said. `` Some I'll tell you about, some I wo n't. But the ducks are important to the Peabody and I'm proud to be the one to see after them. I never saw any reason to change jobs.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> has done other things. Chatting with him, you get the impression that the ones he wo n't tell you about outnumber the ones he will. When he fled his home in Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> in 1918 and the circus people adopted him, they gave him a job delivering the mail for $ 4.28 a week. `` That way I got to know all of them. About half of them could n't read or write, both black and white people I did that for them. Sometimes we'd get a notice that a sheriff was waiting for one of them in the next town, so of course I'd warn them about that. I never turned in anybody.''

 He stayed with the circus 13 years, until he was 22, moving on to more responsible jobs of every sort, including animal handling. Ducks would prove to be a pushover. `` I left the circus because the train was in a wreck coming out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. I was hurt pretty bad, and had to stay behind.'' When he recovered, <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> found jobs where he could, a period in his life he recalls with a grin but few specifics. By inclination he drifted toward the company of entertainers. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he drove the bus for the Count Basie band. In <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, he palled around with blues man W.C. Handy and other Beale Street denizens and in 1940 landed a job at the Peabody, two blocks off <PERSON> Beale </PERSON>, as bell captain. The Peabody, with various face lifts over the years, has been a Southern institution since 1869 and is listed on the national register of historic places. The saying is that the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel and ends on Catfish Row in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. By the time <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> arrived the ducks were an established Peabody trademark. The story is that back in 1932 the hotel's general manager returned from a duck hunting trip with three live decoys, which were legal then. As a prank, he put them in the fountain. They've been there ever since. Now duck imprints show up on everything imprintable _ the hotel's soap, ash urns, swizzle sticks, chocolates that appear on turned-down beds One of its dining rooms is named `` <PERSON> Dux </PERSON>,'' another `` Mallards.'' The only place ducks do not appear is on the menu. That's forbidden. `` The ducks were here when I came,'' <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON> recalls, `` but they did n't do the march then. That started with me. The duck palace is new, too.'' That's where the ducks live in regal splendor on the roof, where people party and dance in the summertime. The palace is a large carpeted cage with a `` bed chamber'' painted purple and gold. Trays of cracked corn are handy. So is a 6-foot-wide pool sweetened daily with fresh lettuce from the kitchen, a flower garden, a 24-foot mural of trees and waterfowl, and a magnificent view of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. It is a duck Camelot and must look inviting to less privileged ducks migrating along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> flyway. `` Oh it does,'' says <PERSON> Pembroke </PERSON>. `` Every spring and fall some of them land on the roof. I shoo'em off.'' He also shoos off the Peabody ducks every four months. `` All that high living makes them so fat they wobble. Not waddle, wobble. So we replace them. They do n't get much exercise swimming around in the fountain, and they ca n't fly.'' They ca n't? `` I clip one wing. Otherwise they'd be flying all around the lobby.'' How long does it take to train a new batch to march down the red carpet? `` One day. People are all lined up along the carpet. Their legs are like fence posts. The ducks have n't got anyplace else to go except to the fountain and back to the elevator. `` They might be a little confused on the first day. After that they do just what I want them to do. `` They get to know my voice. They know I'm the one who feeds them. They also know I'm the one with the stick.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Changes in federal tax laws have put a chill on the rehabilitation of historic buildings. Investment in such projects dropped from $ 2.4 billion in fiscal 1985 to $ 866 million in fiscal 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which must certify properties as historic for tax purposes. Here's a look at one giant renovating firm that has fallen on hard times as a result.

 A developer with a reputation for saving historic buildings threw a party last April to celebrate completion of its most ambitious project, a $ 40 million refurbishing of a 19th-century railroad station in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. `` We believe it will be a grand slam home run,'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dranoff </PERSON>, then-president and chief executive officer of Historic Landmarks for Living, said as the station reopened with 242 luxury apartments, a restaurant and office space. Less than a year later, he's in trouble, hitting just one more long fly since the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> opening, a 105-unit apartment building in a former cosmetics factory in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The Philadelphia-based company is struggling to save itself, largely because of an inability to recover from the tax-law changes that have slashed the nation's investment in historic rehabilitation by two-thirds in the past three years. Preservationists say the company's predicament symbolizes their concern about the future of efforts to recycle old factories, warehouses, hospitals and other threads of the nation's urban fabric. `` There already is a chill,'' says <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's not speculative The numbers are very clear. The interest in renovating historical buildings has crashed since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.'' Word of Historic Landmarks' troubles surfaced when <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorp </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said in mid-December that it expected heavy fourth-quarter losses in part because of troubled real-estate loans. Historic Landmarks, which had completed or planned 66 renovations in 15 cities, soon announced the resignation of <PERSON> Dranoff </PERSON> and the suspension of projects in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ellicott </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Company officials, trying to renegotiate a $ 46-million line of credit and $ 40 million in construction loans with the bank, agreed to an interview but then backed out. On Jan. 31, the company filed for bankruptcy court protection on three partnerships set up to renovate buildings in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and warned in a statement the protection may be sought for other partnerships. Analysts say Historic Landmarks' problems were exacerbated by softening demand for apartment rentals in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, where the company has its greatest concentration of buildings. In addition, the company was stymied in an effort to go public in 1987 and its projects have been under scrutiny by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dranoff </PERSON> has said a city condominium-conversion tax added to the anticipated costs of selling apartment buildings after tax credits expired. Historic Landmarks was one of a number of companies that sprouted after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 authorized major tax incentives for preserving historically certified, income-producing properties. Before that, `` our tax laws favored destruction of existing building stock, because they reimbursed the developer the cost of the demolition and then gave him preferential depreciation rates on his new building,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtaugh </PERSON>, the first keeper of the National Register of Historic Places. In his 1988 book, `` Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Murtaugh </PERSON> said the public and private sector were forced to act together on preservation after World War II because of the impact of interstate highways and urban renewal programs. `` These well-funded government programs were causing major social displacement and widespread obliteration of visual landmarks in most parts of the country, especially in cities,'' he wrote. Developers took even greater interest in preservation after the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 allowed investors a 25 percent tax credit on certified historic rehabilitations. But the 1986 tax law cut the historic-rehab credit to 20 percent, limited it to $ 7,000 for most taxpayers and eliminated it for people with more than $ 250,000 in income. Similar cuts were exacted on low-income housing credits and non-historic restorations. Thus, instead of being able to raise millions of dollars from a few wealthy investors, developers had to raise money in smaller parcels from people with relatively moderate income. While some companies successfully set up partnerships that put investors' money in a portfolio of renovations, many just switched to other types of development. Investment in historic rehabilitation nationwide fell 64 percent to $ 866 million in fiscal 1988 from $ 2.4 billion in fiscal 1985, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which must certify properties as historic for tax purposes.

 `` I did n't go out and restore 300 historic buildings because I'm a frustrated curator,'' said <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mistick </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mistick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> firm that has worked on three projects for Historic Landmarks `` I did it because there were incentives in the tax code to work in historic districts. And it was fun, too.'' Other companies say they are still making a good profit by limiting their involvement to raising the money and hiring out the work. `` We generally do n't act as developer unless we have to,'' says <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` The people here are bankers and lawyers first.'' Historic Landmarks not only has raised the money, but acted as developer, managed the buildings after restoration and set up a realty subsidiary to sell the buildings as condominiums. `` They took the approach of doing large, single projects as opposed to a portfolio of projects,'' says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banwart </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> company whose portfolio includes eight properties this year. `` I do n't want to knock them. Both approaches can be successful, but there's a big difference.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solms </PERSON>, chairman and co-founder of Historic Landmarks, told The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> in a 1983 interview he got into preservation because he abhorred modern high-rise apartments and look-alike developments. `` They're nothing but concrete boxes,'' he said. `` Every apartment looks just like the one next door to it.'' He also said he found satisfaction in converting old buildings into housing that could attract well-paid professionals as renters without displacing low-income residents. `` I buy run-down, abandoned industrial properties,'' he said. `` We're not supplanting the poor. We go into neighborhoods or areas of the city that are languishing.'' For years, Historic Landmarks seemed to have the <LOCATION> Midas </LOCATION> touch, turning buildings covered with pigeon droppings into gleaming, desirable apartments, complete with concierges and limo service. Not that everything always went smoothly with the company. In November 1986, 45,000 demonstrators _ by police estimate _ marched in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> against conversion of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Railroad Station, because <PERSON> Mistick </PERSON>, acting as contractor, was using non-union labor. Some 1,500 union demonstrators kept Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and other dignitaries away from the $ 40 million project's coming-out party last May. `` This demonstration is an embarrassment to everyone,'' <PERSON> Dranoff </PERSON> said, contending one-third to one-half the project was done by union workers. `` It was an open shop with bids from union and non-union,'' he said. The labor troubles were nothing compared to the firestorm that greeted Historic Landmarks' plan in mid-1987 to sell up to $ 25 million of common stock and $ 50 million in debt certificates in a subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Living </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, alleging <PERSON> Solms </PERSON> and his partners were trying to defraud him of his share in several Historic Landmarks projects Butcher's attorneys argued that <PERSON> Solms </PERSON> and his partners `` are transplanting the heart and brain of the organization which has taken years to build and are leaving Butcher with a lifeless corpse, without any compensation whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Solms </PERSON>' attorneys contended Butcher and a company he formed, <ORGANIZATION> Deilwydd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, had bargained away their interest in the future of Historic Landmarks or its subsidiaries. Although Butcher never tried to stop the stock offering, just to share in the proceeds, it was never completed. An unidentified spokesman for Historic Landmarks told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in December the plan was halted by the 1987 stock market crash, not Butcher's lawsuit. For preservationists, the work Historic Landmarks and similar companies have done is ample testimony for the need to restore some aspects of the tax credits taken away in 1986. `` I think the whole purpose of the tax incentive program was to connect the historic buildings to investors,'' said <PERSON> Spatz </PERSON> of the National Trust. `` In 1986, that connection was broken.'' A bill introduced on Feb. 2 by Reps. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennelly </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa., and by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, would raise the historic-rehab credit to the first $ 20,000 of a taxpayer's net liability, plus 20 percent of anything over $ 20,000 It also removes the credits from rules restricting the type of income against which they can be applied and contains safeguards to prevent abuse of the credits by people trying to avoid any tax. `` The tax code has always been a tool of social policy,'' said <PERSON> Mistick </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> developer. `` So we can say, look, we need the urban investment and we can direct that investment through the tax code, or we can address the problem head on and provide hard money for such investment.''

 <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s `` baby'' stands suspended 10 feet off the ground like a beached whale, its black underbelly its most visible feature. A gang of men and women work on it night and day under <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s direction with all the attention a wealthy dowager would get at an expensive spa `` It's just a good old orbiter,'' she says, staring up at the fuselage of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s three space shuttles. `` I'm kind of fond of it. For the last 2 -LCB- years she has been in charge of getting it ready for flight as the first woman ever named by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to be a `` flow director'' for a manned space vehicle. As such, this sprightly 42-year-old engineer-manager with closely cropped hair directs the flow of work that sweeps over the spacecraft from the moment it arrives at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> until it is launched. For <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, launch is scheduled in July. And when it returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> will start all over again. Clusters of technicians patch in the thousands of black thermal tiles that protect its belly from blazing heat of reentry into the atmosphere, as the spacecraft makes its long shallow dive back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Others work on the landing gear, a fuel line valve. Up above in higher scaffolds, on this day, they are removing a radiator from the open cargo bay and making modifications to the crew cabin. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> has about 180 technicians, men and women, working on the vehicle, more than half assigned to the time-consuming job of replacing tiles. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has made seven trips into space, the last just two weeks before Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven. At the time of the accident, <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> was site manager at one of the two orbiter processing facilities, responsible for everything from the complex equipment and technical facilities to the janitorial services and the vending machines. Six months later <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> asked her to take over as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s flow director. `` I had applied for the job, and I was really pleased, because it was something I'd always wanted to do,'' she says. `` I thought, boy, this is going to be fun.'' It's the kind of fun that keeps her busy at least 50 hours a week. She tries to hold it to that so she has some time for her computer analyst husband and their children, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON>, 9. `` We knew the orbiters would be grounded for some time as a result of the accident,'' she says. They expected a lot of changes. And in fact the space agency ordered more than 200 modifications to each of the shuttles, to enhance safety. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest of the vehicles, was to undergo extensive tile overhaul, and thus would be the last to return to flight, after Discovery and Atlantis each had flown two missions. `` I was assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> because I was new and it would give me time to train,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> says. She's at her office in the <ORGANIZATION> Launch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> building about 6:30 every morning to review what went on overnight, notify other officials at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> and at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Every day is replanned again. Two or three times a day she slips over to the processing facility, a block away to check on <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. She's a veteran spacewoman, beginning as a crew systems engineer with the Apollo moon landing program and then with the Skylab space station project and the joint U.S.-Soviet manned flight. Women are no longer rare in a once male-dominated field. `` Things have changed too much,'' she says. `` For a long time, I was one of the few women here, and for the first six months to two years, -LRB- male resentment -RRB- bothered me a little bit, but after that I tended not to notice it.'' `` More and more women were added, and suddenly I found myself going to meetings with other women,'' she says. `` On one of our other orbiters, the lead project engineer is a woman. And, of course, a lot of women are astronauts now. So you go to meetings, and there are a lot of young women there, and you say, ` Gee, we're really good. And it's nice.'' One of the most rewarding moments came last September when they powered up <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for the first time. `` We were working with a very small crew at the time, and all of them really cared about what they were doing,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> says. `` Many people were saying, ` Wow, are you really going to do it?' It really was satisfying. It was a milestone.'' The most frustrating moments occur when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> orders additional changes, and the workload gets heavier and deadlines get tougher to meet. <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> has worked here for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> since 1968, just out of college after earning a bachelor's degree in math and a master's in industrial engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. Her husband, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, whom she married soon after she began work, also is involved in the shuttle program. They try to design the other part of their lives around the children. But tough times are coming as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> gets closer to launch, maybe in July. `` That will be quite a day, the end of a long road,'' she says.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the year of its centennial, the future of Our Lady of the <ORGANIZATION> Rosary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is in doubt. It has one year to show the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> diocese why it should not be closed, along with many others that have already been shut down. Rosary is no textbook parish, but it serves a clientele with special needs.

 On Coming Home Sunday, the Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnoy </PERSON> turns to the visitors in the back of his church and apologizes. `` We're notoriously late,'' the priest confesses as children hop from a bus outside and bound into the red sandstone Roman Catholic church once occupied by Episcopalians. McAnoy's church, Our Lady of the Rosary, is less than a textbook parish in many ways, the priest explains. As the organ strikes up, <PERSON> McAnoy </PERSON>, who is crippled, moves to the lectern to begin his service. He opens with a discussion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and Penthouse magazine. <PERSON> McAnoy </PERSON> is referring to a sketch hanging at the rear of the sanctuary, a picture of Christ in an obvious expression of mirth. The sketch seems appropriate for the themeless decor at Our Lady of the Rosary, a parish celebrating its centennial this year with its future in question. `` That picture first appeared in Penthouse magazine, and the official church was,'' the priest pauses, `` chagrined to say the least.'' But the picture is a favorite of the 59-year-old priest whose defiance dates to his days in the seminary when he let a woman _ his younger sister _ ride with him in the front seat of the car. `` I look at it whenever I get down in the dumps,'' <PERSON> McAnoy </PERSON> says. There have been reasons for McAnoy to get down in the dumps of late. On Jan. 8, Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> labeled Rosary `` questionably viable,'' along with 24 other city churches. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> also announced that 30 of the 112 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> would be closed in an unprecedented retrenchment. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said `` questionably viable'' churches would have one year to prove their viability or also face closing. McAnoy, a priest for 35 years, is known as Mac to Rosary's eclectic parishioners, most of whom live in the blighted neighborhood that lies in the shadow of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> world headquarters The golden statue atop the building is visible from Interstate 94 just south of the church, which now shares a block with service station and is the emergency shelter for a corrections center across the street. Once attended almost exclusively by working-class European immigrant families, Rosary's congregation is about 60 percent white, 25 percent black and 15 percent Asian. They include professionals, laborers and recovering alcoholics, along with handicapped people. Rosary's handicapped members live in 44 group homes in the neighborhood. Every year they are treated to a party at the church. The celebration starts as the handicapped people are collected in a caravan weaving behind businesses on <LOCATION> Woodward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, near the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Parishioner <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossman </PERSON>, a suburbanite who works at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, says about 40 of the church's 477 members live in the group homes, which have proliferated in the neighborhood because of the trend toward moving handicapped people out of institutions and because real estate is cheap `` I do n't know if these people would be accepted anywhere else,'' <PERSON> Gossman </PERSON> says. This year's party was another activity on Coming Home Sunday. The 270 guests included an unshaven man who wandered around the church, pant legs dragging the floor, and a man who lip-synced a spirited conversation with someone who was n't there. Another mistook a baptismal font for an offertory bowl and dropped a nickel into the empty stone. Many are physically handicapped and find the pewless church comfortable. If they want to meander, rock in their chairs or pray as if God were hard of hearing, no one bothers them. `` The best thing is the subtle way the developmentally disabled are accepted, especially those who are regular,'' says <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON>, president of the church council and an English teacher at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Spain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> `` It's authentic. It's not put on.'' Mac knows the problems of the handicapped. A recovering alcoholic, the priest had one of his legs amputated 2 -LCB- years ago because of poor circulation caused in part by alcohol, something he has lived without for 11 years. He gets around in a wheelchair except during Mass when he stands to preach with the aid of a prosthesis. `` One of the things you hear in Father Mac's sermons is, ` If you're not perfect, that's OK. Look at me,''' <PERSON> Gossman </PERSON> says The church's work with handicapped people, however, wo n't be enough to see it through its period of probation. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> says he wants the parish to build a larger presence at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and to devote more effort to promoting the rosary. `` That the cardinal has challenged us to do the evangelization is no problem,'' says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON>, a member of Rosary and a lawyer helping some of the 30 closing churches appeal the decision to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` But on the other hand, there's a bit of cynicism about the evangelization because the archbishop has never guided us.'' Church members also are optimistic because money is n't a pressing problem. A large part of Rosary's $ 85,000 budget last year came from interest on an investment of about $ 110,000. `` We have no bills, no mortgage and the property is basically in good repair,'' <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> says. Still, financing will be a question when the church is asked to prove itself next December. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> says the church will have to collect more than the $ 26,000 that came from offerings last year, but he says people have begun dropping more in the collection plate since the crisis. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> thinks the church's location, in an area he said is destined to be a center of urban growth and development, helped it win a reprieve. The diocese, he says, just did n't realize how much activity was planned for the area when it proposed closing Rosary because of stagnation. The city's Community and <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says new housing is slated for a wide expanse of land two blocks from the church and the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has announced plans to build a hospital inside the parish's boundary. <PERSON> Kidd </PERSON> says it's ironic the church must turn its attention to survival at the same time it prepares for its centennial Aug. 24. On that day 100 years ago, the parish held its first Mass in the dining room of a home off a muddy path that was Woodward Avenue. The one-year reprieve, and the hope it brings for continued life at <LOCATION> Rosary </LOCATION>, is cause for celebrating early.

 <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> rushes into his living room, late and apologetic, wearing a white warm-up suit. He'd had to take his 60-year-old azalea bonsai to a Japanese tree surgeon. `` I'm not a great gardener,'' confesses the 72-year-old actor who will be honored Tuesday on `` The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salute </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I just try to follow instructions and keep things from dying.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, who has reached the twilight of his acting career, finds plenty of time for gardening. `` I'd like to keep working,'' he says, `` but if I do n't work again that's OK with me.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> special, such former co-stars as <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> -LRB- `` Designing Woman'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> -LRB- `` Roman Holiday'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> -LRB- `` Big Country'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> -LRB- `` Duel in the Sun'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> -LRB- `` Old Gringo'' -RRB- will pay tribute to the star whose film career goes back to 1943. His latest film is `` Old Gringo,'' in which he plays author-journalist <ORGANIZATION> Ambrose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bierce </ORGANIZATION> in a fictional account of his disappearance during the Mexican Revolution in 1913. The movie, in which <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> plays a spinster <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> schoolteacher and <PERSON> Smits </PERSON> is a fiery Mexican general, will be released later this year. `` Things are slowing down, but I expected that,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> says. `` I'm getting on in age. There was a time I was champing at the bit if I did n't make three pictures a year. For all I know I may never make another picture. `` But somebody may be at a typewriter writing a new picture and thinking of <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> for one of the roles. Most of the good pictures I've done have been dropped into my lap.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> says his own favorites from among the 51 pictures he's made are `` To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the film that brought him an Academy Award as best actor in 1962, `` Roman Holiday,'' `` The Gunfighter,'' `` Captain <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornblower </PERSON>'' and `` The Guns of Navarone.'' `` Hornblower'' was based on the books about the British naval hero created by C.S. Forester. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> says he'd always hoped to do a sequel. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> describes `` The Guns of Navarone'' as `` good, all-out entertainment,'' but says it's really a comedy. `` It's a put-on,'' he says. `` Five or six guys take on the whole Nazi army and beat them. Every time we turned one way, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> went the other way. It was the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kops </ORGANIZATION>. It was a put-on of a great war picture.'' He refers to `` Duel in the Sun'' as a parody of a Western that they called `` Lust in the Dust'' when they were making it. `` <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had just played a saint in ` Song of <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>' and I had played a saintly priest in ` Keys of the Kingdom,''' he says `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Selznick </PERSON> took great delight in casting us as <PERSON> Lewt </PERSON> and Pearl. I was the renegade son and she was the wild half-breed.'' In recent years, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> has also appeared on television. He played <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in the 1982 miniseries `` The Blue and the Gray'' and was a priest in `` The Scarlet and the Black'' in 1983. `` I've been offered series,'' he says. `` I'm not snobbish about television. You want to make it as good as possible, but on television you never have enough time. I'd rather wait for something good to come along. Or not work at all. `` When you reach 70 it limits people's perceptions. They begin to think of you as too old for roles. But that's OK. I do n't blame them. And I do want to play parts my own age.'' Unlike some actors, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> admits that he occasionally watches his old films on television. `` I saw ` Shootout' recently for the first time since we made it in 1971,'' he says. `` It was directed by <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, who also directed me in ` How the West Was Won.' `` He was a director from the old school who tried to tell a story visually. ` Shootout' was somewhat similar to ` True Grit,' which <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> had also directed. He always had something going, an energy, a drive, and a way of linking the scenes together. `` Seeing my films years later I've come to appreciate the director much more. At the time you're wrapped up in your role and you're trying to do it as well as you can. You ca n't see the forest for the trees. But after time has gone by I can appreciate the director's style.''

 The quiet, ivy-covered campus at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> seems a long way from Times Square, but it has become a hot spot for producers testing shows on their way to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. `` What you have is a New Haven-Boston-Philadelphia-Washington tryout in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> producer who first started the migration south in 1986. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> is a pragmatic, plain-spoken veteran of the Broadway theater. He has presented every <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> play on Broadway since 1972. He's also a co-producer of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' this season's newest hit and the biggest box-office bonanza since `` The Phantom of the Opera. <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> discovered <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> through his family. His daughter went to school there. During a visit, <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> saw a theater in the student union building and fell in love with it. `` This is what all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> should have _ beautiful 640-seat theaters to do plays,'' he says. Through the efforts of then-drama head <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clum </PERSON> and a handshake agreement with <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleishman </PERSON>, a senior vice president at the university, the producer brought <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s `` Long Day's Journey into Night'' starring <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> takes a show to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, everybody _ from actors to stagehands _ works for minimum salary, and authors forego royalties Students get to work behind the scenes with professionals on everything from props to sets to publicity. Since `` Long Day's Journey,'' <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> has done <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Broadway Bound'' and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> in `` A Month of Sundays'' at <LOCATION> Duke </LOCATION> Now other producers have noticed the campus, too. `` They have picked up on the idea that it makes sense _ artistically, financially, theatrically,'' <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> says. `` You're bringing something to a new area and the audiences respond. <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lortel </PERSON> took `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON>'s two-character play about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet arms control negotiators, to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> In February, dance superstar <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> played three sold-out weeks in an adaptation of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakfa </PERSON>'s `` Metamorphosis'' before coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Producers can do their thing in a very relaxed, non-pressure situation,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>, administrative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> drama program. And they get intelligent, aware and responsive audiences, according to <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> is one point in the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION>, an area that also includes <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and its large number of schools and universities. The triangle has the highest per capita population of Ph.D. engineers and scientists in the country. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is a wealthy, conservative school, built on the tobacco fortune of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. The school, according to one college guide, likes to think of itself as `` the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> of the South,'' and its academic credentials are impressive with first-rate engineering, business and medical schools. Now the drama program _ it is n't a department yet _ has decided to try for a higher visibility. The program is headed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, formerly of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Ball, who arrived in 1985, currently supervises 35 students and a faculty of 12 instructors, including <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> who teaches a theater appreciation course. His reading list includes <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON>'s `` The Real Thing,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> Beach Memoirs'' and <PERSON> Athol </PERSON> <PERSON> Fugard </PERSON>'s `` Master Harold ... and the boys,'' all of them, not coincidentally, produced on Broadway by <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> Because of the Broadway tryout situation, students and professionals learn from each other, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> says. `` We had a session with four actresses who were in the cast and understudied roles in ` A Month of Sundays,''' he recalls. `` They talked to our senior students which that year included seven women and one guy. What was supposed to be a 45-minute discussion about the roles of women in theater, went on for five hours.'' Ball also decided to take the tryout program one step further. Besides serving as a testing ground for new Broadway shows, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> would be used as an incubator for new plays by unknown authors and starring unknown actors. The first new play produced under this program was `` Moonlight and Valentino'' by <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. It had its world premiere in February in a tiny performance space in the basement of the student union building. `` The fact that it's <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s daughter has something to do with it and nothing to do with it,'' <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON> says. `` It is a good play. Now we've taken the money generated out of certain endowments that we've helped arrange and are using it for new playwrights.'' Money for those endowment funds is being raised through benefit performances for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> alumni of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` Les Miserables'' in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and `` The Phantom of the Opera'' in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. More than 40 students worked on `` Metamorphosis'' and `` Moonlight and Valentino'' during their performances at <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` Moonlight,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Azenberg </ORGANIZATION>, will have another life somewhere in regional theater before he decides whether to bring it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The play already has made its mark on the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> students who were involved in its production, and students were more involved in it than `` Metamorphosis,'' which arrived with a complete <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> production team. `` The stage manager of ` Moonlight and <PERSON> Valentino </PERSON>' is in the last semester of her senior year,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> says. `` She has now, to her credit, two or three Broadway shows on which she has been assistant stage manager and has her Equity card. That's the kind of experience you ca n't buy.'' Ball has even more plans for <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION>, including the start-up late this spring of a professional theater company in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>. With <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON> and other investors, he has privately funded <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION> to make low-budget movies. The profits will be go back to <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Drama </PERSON> as well as help finance the new play program with <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> is one of these producers who's really in the business because he loves the theater,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> says. `` So am I, but it's easier for me I do n't have to worry about selling tickets too often.''

<TEXT>
 Still looming over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s capital city today is <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, a turreted, ancient fortress on a hill that has succumbed to English invasions since the 7th century. It's symbolic of how <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, nearly 300 years after its union with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, feels dominated by its southern neighbor, which sets the direction for its economy _ not always, many Scots feel, the most desirable one. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s lack of control over its own economic affairs is a big issue north of the border, particularly now that a sharp rise in interest rates is threatening a slow, belated recovery in the Scottish economy. The feeling that <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has fallen behind <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, that its economy has been battered by nearly a decade of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s policies, makes for some potent anti-government, and anti-English sentiment, in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has pushed interest rates up 5.5 percentage points to 13 percent in five months to curb inflation, which has accelerated to a 7.5-percent annual rate. This, among other things, could raise the value of the British pound and hurt exports, on which the country depends heavily. `` The harmful effects of dampening could be worse on the Scottish economy, just because you're cutting the recovery off just at the point where it should continue to be growing,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The backlash, also fueled by strong opposition to the government's property tax reform, has revived Scottish nationalist sentiment, and a heated debate over whether <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> should keep the status quo or seek self-government. The tax reform, known as the poll tax, takes effect in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in April and is based on the number of people in a home rather than the value of the property. Property values tend to be lower in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` There is a great struggle of minds in the people of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sillars </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, who won a stunning election victory in <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> in November, ousting a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member and reviving his party's fortunes. Opinion polls consistently find 80 percent of Scots would prefer a moderate degree of self-government. But the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s call for outright independence attracts only minority support. Now the nationalists have come up with a new formula, `` Independence within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' whereby <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> would become independent but retain an association with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> by joining the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. A recent opinion poll put support for the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at 28 percent, double its strength in the June 1987 general election. It stands in second place after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has a 41-percent approval rating. Conservatives are third at 20 percent. Of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s 72 seats in the 650-member House of Commons in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 49 are Labor, 10 are Conservative, four are nationalist, and the rest are held by centrist parties. A referendum in 1979 failed to win the necessary majority for devolution, or self-government within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has always had its own church -LRB- Presbyterian as opposed to Anglican in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -RRB-, its own currency and its own legal and educational systems, but critical decisions such as interest rate increases are usually taken in <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION>, the seat of government in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 400 miles south. Most Scots are staunch socialists. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a fervent capitalist, has been fighting to eradicate socialism from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. She is also a firm believer in maintaining the union between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` This government remains committed to the union, as committed as ever,'' she said in a recent speech in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` And it is in the union that we have flourished and found strength.'' Nationalists have long accused the English of fostering <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s kilt-and-bagpipe identity as a diversion from the real issues of nationhood. Now they talk of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> being `` Englished'' as more and more positions of power in the Scottish cultural bureaucracy fall to English appointees. The government's Scottish secretary, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, says <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION> have benefited greatly from the government, which spent 2,676 pounds -LRB- $ 4,683 -RRB- per capita in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, compared with 2,162 pounds -LRB- $ 3,784 -RRB- overall in the last fiscal year. Scottish-born <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, says government policy is not to `` put more pounds into people's pockets'' but to make them take the initiative. In a speech, he urged Scots: `` Search out the opportunities. Do not just respond to those put on the plate before you.''

 <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> was united with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1707. Its 5.1 million people are about one-tenth of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s population, and its 30,000 square miles represent about one-third of the kingdom. Its economy now depends on services and high technology, rather than basic industries, largely because it has managed to attract outside investment _ principally American investors in the electronics industry, who have created a `` Silicon Glen'' in central <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil industry has been recovering from a sharp downturn in 1986. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s huge financial services sector is growing a bit. The historic industries of whisky, salmon fishing and woolens have modernized and are thriving, partly by targeting the upscale market. Unemployment, at 10.3 percent, is finally falling, and Scottish businessmen are looking confident. `` Generally the scene is quite good,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, Scottish director of the Confederation of British Industry. The Scottish economy grew an estimated 3.5 percent last year, compared with 4.5 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> overall. It should grow as much as 3 percent this year, faster, for a change, than <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> professor. But not everybody's assessment is sunny, and many problems remain. Sillars, the nationalist, said: `` There's a lot of economic anxiety around in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has been painfully wrenched from its dependence on its declining heavy industries and its job losses, which have been exacerbated by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s refusal to use taxpayers' money to rescue ailing industries. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate remains 3.3 percentage points higher than the British average of 7 percent. The number of people employed in steel, shipbuilding, coal and the heavy engineering industries has fallen in 30 years from 300,000 to about 50,000, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. `` There is an incredibly strong attachment to -LRB- what -RRB- represents Scottish industrial heritage,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` There is an enormous reluctance to come to terms with that and change that.'' Critics complain that inward investment is creating a branch economy based on low-skilled assembly jobs. `` The problem with <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> is that we do n't have -LRB- new -RRB- indigenous industry,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregson </PERSON>, a Scottish entrepreneur. Many of the jobs created by the inward investment go to women, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. `` I think it has a very distinct effect on the way <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> lives. We're a very chauvinistic society,'' he said. Strongly Presbyterian, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> prides itself on its respect for authority, its moral standards, work ethic and collective spirit. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> also is concerned about outside takeovers of its relatively small number of public companies. Many Scots lay the blame for this on Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s free-market policies. There also is lingering resentment that <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> does n't benefit more from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil revenue. The long list of complaints underscores that <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> `` has got a very big chip on its shoulder,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the professor. `` There is an enormous sense of oppression. Everything is the sense of the English against <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` There's a need to step back from that kind of pattern.''

 Democracy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> style, went to work aboard a Soviet fishing vessel off <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Its 50 officers and sailors met during a storm to nominate a candidate for a new national assembly back home. Slicing through 40-foot foam-flecked waves, the 18,000-ton <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> covered 400 nautical miles before its crew could agree on who they thought should represent them in the halls of power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said first mate <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atroshnikov </PERSON>. Democracy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> style, pre-empted the movie `` King Kong'' in the palace of culture of this port city 1,000 miles north of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, famed as the destination of the World War II Allied convoys carrying guns and Spam to the embattled Soviets. In snow-coated Kirov Palace, where on other days the great ape had roared on the screen, more than 700 delegates from city workplaces and neighborhoods gathered to whittle down the list of candidates to be proposed to voters. It took them nine hours to pare the list of six names to three. With passion and skepticism, a modest measure of ballyhoo and a big dose of confusion, this city of 440,000 and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at large are experiencing their first nationwide election campaign where voters will be allowed a choice, instead of having a single candidate put up by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm running because the law now gives me that right, and I want to state my positions,'' said one <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> candidate, <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON>, an engineer who has worked on nuclear-powered icebreakers. `` That's my only goal.'' Said the chief of <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khachenko </PERSON>: `` In the past, we used to gather in committee and say: ` How many women candidates do we need here, or how many workers there?' This time not a single candidate has been endorsed by the city -LRB- party -RRB- committee.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who championed the multi-candidate elections, calls the exercise a `` school of democracy.'' He says Soviet political life must be opened to greater citizen participation if his program for `` perestroika'' -LRB- social and economic change -RRB- is to succeed. That's the theory. In practice, there are clear signs of pressure from the party in some sections of the country, like the conservative <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, to have a party-backed candidate become the voter's sole option in the elections March 26 for the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> The electoral changes, approved in December by the Soviet parliament, also create what some Soviets call `` filters'' at several levels to block candidates who ca n't garner majority support on nominating panels. One famous victim of the `` filters'' was <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, whose candidacy was not backed by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The choice of the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>'s crew, the captain of another fishing boat, never made it through a subsequent nominating meeting held by representatives of <LOCATION> Sevriba </LOCATION>, the enterprise that runs the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and more than 70 other Murmansk-based fishing vessels As a result of the meeting in late February at the culture palace, voters in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>'s Territorial Election District No. 224 will choose on March 26 from among a doctor, the chief of a fishing trawler fleet, and the 37-year-old <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON>. What's emerging in their fledgling campaigns is a pronounced accent on local issues, such as the lack of housing that's keeping 50,000 <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> residents waiting for better apartments; the rationing of sugar, sausage and other staples; the lack of polyclinics in new neighborhoods, and the fouling of the environment by industry in this once pristine region north of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON>'s nine-minute speech at the Kirov Palace never mentioned <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but detailed the problems of his fellow city dwellers and had a distinct `` let's send a message to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'' tone. `` When you're talking about people's lives, you must make demands,'' he declared. According to <PERSON> Khachenko </PERSON>, there's little if any difference in the candidates' platforms: `` What people want is a deputy with courage who will fight for what he believes in.'' What's also becoming apparent in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> is a clannishness, or splitting along professional lines. `` The city's doctors are campaigning for the doctor and are in the street passing out leaflets,'' <PERSON> Khachenko </PERSON> said. The captain, meanwhile, has surrounded himself with other captains. A local editor, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prostikhin </PERSON>, is trying to shake off attempts by <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>'s electoral commission to force his <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, run by the <ORGANIZATION> Murmansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, to give equal space to other candidates besides <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON>, a shipping company employee. `` That's pressure on the press,'' Prostikhin maintained. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new electoral system is a school, <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON> is a budding star pupil. The lanky <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> native with gray-streaked black hair wears a burgandy tie and light blue shirt, because allies advised him to. However, the engineer drew the line at loosening his collar and tie while campaigning, as his advisers suggested. `` Somebody told me that's what <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> senators do, but it would n't look proper here,'' <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON> said in an interview, between puffs on an imported Pall Mall cigarette. Before the Kirov Palace meeting, <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON> bought time on an electric sign that shines down on <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>'s main square. `` VOTE FOR ANDREI <LOCATION> ALEKSEYEICH </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ZOLOTKOV </LOCATION>,'' it said. He wanted to rent a sound truck but relented when told that the move might offend other candidates. His character became a campaign issue when one participant in the Kirov Palace meeting asked him if he would have the courage to publicly oppose a decision by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Yes,'' he responded. `` I already have disagreements with the election law,'' <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON> said. `` Why should a member of the -LRB- party -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have more votes than I do?'' The Gorbachev-backed law gives the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the right to directly fill 100 of the assembly's 2,250 seats. Whether a candidate like <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON> can win March 26 is a subject of keen debate in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. `` Perestroika so far here is more slogans that deeds,'' said <PERSON> Yura </PERSON> <PERSON> Verbitsk </PERSON>, 24, who works at a plant that burns garbage to generate electricity. `` There are a lot of people still around from the era of -LRB- Leonid I. -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>,'' the late Soviet president. But the fact Zolotkov even made it to the ballot is a sign of changing times. To become the candidate proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Murmansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, he beat out a man who would have been an easy winner in past elections, an icebreaker captain awarded the coveted title of Hero of Socialist Labor. <PERSON> Zolotkov </PERSON>, a candidate for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, says he is no expert on economics or legal matters but wants to go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to make <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vision of Soviet democracy work. `` If one party is directing things, that's exactly why we need a stronger legislature,'' he said. `` By my activities, I want to demonstrate that there can be controls on power.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``True Believer''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The American judicial system, that great theater of the absurd, seems to inspire more movies than any subject except love. The newest addition to the pantheon is `` True Believer,'' the saga of one burned-out lawyer and the murder case which offers him redemption. In the capable hands of director <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, the imaginative story of lawyer <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> becomes a genuine edge-of-your-seat thriller with an ending that, for once, is not telegraphed in advance. Believable? Well, one ca n't ask for everything. Suspension of disblief is the name of the game in <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Strick </PERSON>'s cleverly crafted script. We meet <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> at the nadir of his brilliant legal career. Once a champion of the underdog, a fighter for unpopular causes, this aging radical with the graying pony tail, has been reduced to defending drug dealers. He says he's fighting for the constitution, but neither he nor we believe that. With the arrival of his fresh-faced, hero worshipping new law clerk -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> is reminded of his past glories but gives the apprentice defense lawyer his most cynical assessment of the accused: `` They're all guilty.'' That pronouncement quickly is followed by the arrival at <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s office of a tearful mother seeking help for her imprisoned son She claims the son, a Korean-American, was wrongly convicted of a <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> murder. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> takes the case, and with that begins piecing together a puzzle so complicated we are n't quite sure where it leads. When the revelations pile up toward the end, they are stunning. The pace of `` True Believer'' is so fast that we have little time to question its real-world underpinnings. It will be hours before we begin to wonder why <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, hated by law enforcement, would tempt fate by openly smoking pot in his law office. Or why the most simple fact involving the location of the coroner's office eludes everyone on this case for years. But the plot is complex enough to distract us from such concerns. And the peformances _ particularly <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' _ make it all seem plausible. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> is appealing as the wide-eyed young law clerk who helps crack the case. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallahan </PERSON> is memorable as the key prosecution witness and <PERSON> Kurtwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> gives a cool malevolence to the district attorney. <PERSON> Yuji </PERSON> <PERSON> Okumoto </PERSON> as the accused murderer and <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> as one of several villains, give strong supporting performances. Production designer <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> adds insight into <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s character with his cluttered office and the lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> world he inhabits. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> puts his stamp so strongly on <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing this off-beat character. With such successful casting, could there be a sequel in the works? `` True Believer'' is rated R for violence.

 `` Spike of <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta, $ 89.95. Rated R -RRB- I fell asleep midway through this thoroughly confused and confusing movie, woke up, dutifully rewound and watched again and I still do n't understand what happens in `` Spike of <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>.'' Or why or how. And it did n't make me care. <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> -RRB- is your basic no-talent club fighter who gets involved with <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> -LRB- the amusing <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitillo </PERSON> -RRB-, daughter of the local don -LRB- <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgnine </PERSON> -RRB- and gets her pregnant as a kind of career move. Of course the don wants no part of <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>, who is exiled from <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> -RRB- and he impregnates a pal's sister _ the achingly lovely <PERSON> Talisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, whose luminous beauty is utterly wasted here. I swear I do n't know why any of this movie happens the way it does. None of the characters are real. The actors are pretending they are real, but it's really easy to see they are not _ all except <PERSON> Talisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, who wisely says little. `` Spike of <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>'' is a disquieting thing to see: It's not like real life. It's not like a movie fantasy. It's not funny. It's not scary It's not anything. _ By <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' -LRB- Sire -RRB- _ <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> `` You ca n't beat 2 guitars, bass, drum.'' <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> states this in the liner notes and proves it in each of the 14 songs on this album. His four-piece band turns out essential rock' n' roll, lean and muscular. And this close-to-the-bone playing is the only proper accompaniment for the down-to-the-marrow lyrics of <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s bleak look at his city. The wild side of city life that <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> once glorified has turned brutal in the age of crack and AIDS. Drugged-out parents beat their kids, love and sex are just a brief escape from the crack wars, the ghosts of AIDS victims haunt the `` Halloween Parade'' and about all you can depend on is `` the worst always happening.'' The album title might as well include a date _ sometime in late 1988. References to specific crime cases and to <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> threaten to turn the album into the audio equivalent of one day's issue of a tabloid newspaper _ lacking in the timelessness or universality that can touch people years later or miles away. But just as a human interest feature story in a newspaper can be more gripping than the latest shock headline, `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is most successful when <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> focuses on individuals. In `` <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Had </PERSON> <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> comes in from the crack-ridden streets for a few moment's escape in bed with his Juliette. In `` Dirty Blvd.'' young <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> finds a book on magic in a garbage can and sits in his welfare hotel room wishing he could make himself disappear. The album's lyrical strengths and shortcomings are highlighted by a mix in which <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s unvarnished vocal is featured prominently. But if `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' proves to have staying power, credit the two guitars, bass, drum. _ By <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Money for Nothing'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Dire Straits This greatest-hits collection, coming as it does in the midst of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON>'s public nonchalance about the future of Dire Straits, if any, has an air of finality to it. But this is no `` Crossroads'' - style retrospective; rather, it's the obligatory, single-disc collection with the obligatory live track `` not previously available'' _ in this case, the gentle `` Portobello Belle Much of the material is, then, Dire Straits' `` hits.'' But the band has had few real hit singles; they are an album group, and most fans will already have many of these songs. One notable omission is `` Skateaway'' from `` Making Movies,'' which became a semi-video-hit in the early days of <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. `` Money for Nothing'' _ this album, not the single, which is indeed included _ also has one major fault: an unfortunate remixing of the fine dance track, `` Twisting by the Pool.'' This time, the sound is thinner, and some of <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON>'s vocals _ about the closest his singing ever came to a rock' n' roll rave-up _ have actually been deleted. Still, many of these songs remain certifiably brilliant. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON> was fond of introducing his group in concert as the `` Dire Straits rock' n' roll band,'' and it has been that milieu, not his session work or his film scores, that stands as his highest testament. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 Concerto No. 2, Op. 18 in C minor; Etudes-Tableaux, Op. 39, by <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>; <PERSON> Evgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissin </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION>, conducted by <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergiev </PERSON> -LRB- RCA <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> -RRB- For an 18-year-old Russian pianist who played his first recital seven years ago, why not debut on disc with <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON>'s virtuosic and most recorded of his four piano concerti. <PERSON> Evgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissin </PERSON>, who looks about 14 in his picture, gives a sure reading of this lush, difficult work. He has plenty of technique and plays without affectation. What's missing is a more vivid sense of mood and character changes in contrasting sections _ the different flavors shown by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Graffman </PERSON>, say, with <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> on an older CBS recording. Then there's always <PERSON> Sviatoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>'s performance on DG, and of course the composer's own 1929 version with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orchestra </LOCATION> The sound of the RCA recording is clear, though sometimes the piano is a bit mushy, perhaps the result of a little too much pedal. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Gergiev </PERSON>, music director of the Kirov Opera, and the <ORGANIZATION> LSO </ORGANIZATION> provide solid support, particularly with some gorgeous wind solos in the second movement. <PERSON> Rachmaninoff </PERSON> wrote the work after being treated for a paralyzing depression brought on by the failure of his first symphony in 1897. He dedicated the concerto to Dr. <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, who helped his depression with hypnosis, repeating _ as <PERSON> Racn </PERSON> to write your concerto. ... you will work with great facility. ... the concerto will be of an excellent quality.''' He did. He did. It is. <PERSON> Kissin </PERSON>'s performance is excellent but not hypnotic. It's nice to see the infrequently recorded Etudes-Tableaux coupled with the concerto. They have a Chopinesque flavor to them, varying in moods. <PERSON> Kissin </PERSON> is more successful in the more intimate, quieter moments. By the way, why include only six of the nine etudes in Op. 39? At only 59:53, the disc has plenty of room to include the other three. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Adventures of Terry Gilliam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> does n't make box-office ticket machines sing. His movies are n't stuffed with car chases, naked women or automatic weaponry. He prefers strange characters, weird settings and unusual endings. Most of what <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> does rubs corporate Hollywood the wrong way. And that's why the arrival of his new film, `` The Adventures of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>,'' is such a minor miracle. While many other <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> filmmakers produce predictable, mass appeal fare, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> grinds out ruminations on fantasy, idealism, history and death. `` I'm desperately trying to make popular films because they speak to a large audience,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said on a recent visit from his home in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` But I also want to turn people a little bit off the path they are charging down.'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>'s past films have been praised by critics as much for what the movies do as for what they do n't do. Both 1981's `` Time Bandits,'' about a schoolboy's exotic travels through the past, and 1985's `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' a bleak scrutiny of a nonsensical future, refused to surrender their inventive premises. `` I had a very early talk with producer <PERSON> Arnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Milchan </PERSON> when we started ` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,' `` <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` <PERSON> Arnon </PERSON>, we have to approach this film in a very specific way. We have to think of it as the most spectacular failure the world has ever seen. Because the minute we start to think of it as a great film, or a good film or a popular film _ any of those things _ we then start compromising.''' Four years in the making, `` Baron Munchausen'' fits no mold either. In visually overwhelming style, the movie chronicles the fantastic travels of a 10-year-old girl -LRB- <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Polley </PERSON> -RRB- and the legendary German calvary officer <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hieronymus </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> -RRB-, who was known for his exaggerated tales. -LRB- His exploits were chronicled by the German writer <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Raspe </PERSON>. -RRB- The two, trapped in an 18th-century European city surrounded by threatening armies, set out in an improvised hot air balloon to save their compatriots. The couple's odyssey takes them to the moon, the center of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the stomach of a giant sea monster. While <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> says the film should appeal to a broad audience, its lack of stars and British flavor will present a marketing challenge to <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. And <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, already having survived the film's difficult production, knows he's not yet out of the woods. `` There are a lot of people here,'' he said with a sweep of his hand toward <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, `` who have worked very hard at training an audience. I think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the most brainwashed country in the world.'' Brainwashed, <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said, into thinking that everything is safe, and nothing unusual is worth experiencing. `` McDonald's hamburgers are safe. They're not good or bad. They're safe. You know exactly what you're going to get. `` Everything here is so infantile. There is no future, there is no past, and the present is reduced to a nanosecond. People are just seeing the same thing over and over again. They're being pandered to all the time and their vision of the world gets smaller and smaller.'' Only a few moviegoers these days now want to be challenged, he said. `` It terrifies me. What happens is that the handful of people who are doing really interesting things end up only speaking to a very small audience. And that's what I do n't want to do.'' Whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> audiences love or hate `` Baron Munchausen'' is n't exactly the point What <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> is after is shaking the seats in which they so casually slump. `` When my kids were younger, I would read fairy tales to them _ ` Red Riding Hood.' And it's bowdlerized. Suddenly, the wolf does n't really eat Granny <PERSON> Granny </PERSON> actually has been somehow hiding _ she'd run and hide in the cupboard `` And the woodsman has been turned into daddy, who chases the wolf away. The whole point is just gone. And those fairy tales are meant to be frightening. They're meant to scare the kids. Children should know the world is not just a jolly place. `` And we just sit here and tell the kids it's all ` Sesame Street' time _ everything is wonderful I do n't mind that, but I think the balance is gone. ... People do n't want to see depressing endings. But most of the great works of art tended to be tragedies.'' Unlike `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' a movie so terrifying that <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> originally refused to release it, `` Baron Munchausen'' celebrates the triumph of whimsy. `` I wanted to make an upbeat movie,'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> said. `` I wanted fantasy to win. I was making a film primarily for my daughters -LRB- ages eight and 12 -RRB- _ and to tell this fairy tale, not another fairy tale.'' <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, 38, a graduate of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a frequent collaborator with the British comedy troupe <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>, said that as pleased as he is with `` <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>,'' he'd never want to repeat the experience. `` You begin to wonder whether it is worth four years of your life. I would n't do it again. I hated the thing and I actually wanted to quit. `` It was the worst nightmare I've ever been involved in. By week two, I wanted out. It was like punishment for something I'd done. I actually felt like Job.'' Out of such anguish, though, do wonderful endings sometimes follow.

<HEAD>The Artists: Underground Art Surfaces at Pompidou Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A clanking pin ball machine, six bicycles and a projector showing white light are among 100 pieces of `` anti-art'' objects on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Georges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pompidou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in a retrospective of Situationist art. It is said to be the first such exhibit of its kind. `` On the Passage of a Few People Through a Rather Brief Moment in Time, the Situationists 1957-1972,'' features comic strips, cartoons, pamphlets, posters, paintings, sculpture and books documenting the growth of the International Situationist. The International Situationist was an underground, avant-garde movement of the 1960s and'70s which attempted to tear down the barriers between art and everyday life. Situationists worked to combat what they saw as the oppression of the individual by advertising and other elements of a capitalist society. `` Their basic idea was that the mediated image controls us,'' said <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, chief curator at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> which co-produced the show with the <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. `` Advertising is so dominant people only know what they're told to desire, there's no room for their own desires to surface.'' The show will run in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> through April 9, go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> from June 21 to Aug. 13 and move to the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> from Oct. 21 to Jan. 7, Among works on display are a giant collage-mural by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who designed posters and record covers for the now-defunct Sex Pistols punk rock group, and paintings by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinot-Gallizio </PERSON> wrapped around an industrial Most notable in his absence is <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Debord </PERSON>, the French filmmaker who was the movement's leading theoretician and author of the Situationist bible, `` The Society of the Spectacle.'' The reclusive <PERSON> Debord </PERSON> has not allowed screenings of his films since 1982, but they were evoked in the show by a whirring projector showing only a beam of light. The exhibition would probably horrify die-hard Situationists who were opposed to both showing or selling art. Born in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as an offshoot of surrealism, the movement _ gathering no more than 100 members at any given time _ expelled followers who became too commercial. `` Painting is finished. It might as well be killed off,'' proclaimed one poster. This early philosophy rose to a climax during the 1968 student revolts in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, made its way to the Univerisity of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, and contributed, ultimately, to the rise of punk culture in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in the'70s. `` For the International Situationist, there is no separation between art and nonart,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollen </PERSON>, the show's curator. `` Art became a total environment, not a canvas on the wall.'' <PERSON> Wollen </PERSON> said he spent three years tracking down the documents which had been scattered throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Everything had vanished. Many items turned up in basements and garages, and a few were taken out of museum storage rooms. The International Situationist argued that society was turning into an all-embracing spectacle under the pressure of ever-expanding Western capitalism. `` Most of the Situationists would have liked to dynamite a place like the <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, so it's really ironic that they're being consecrated here,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Higonnet </PERSON>, an antique dealer and longtime aficionado of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Situationist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. The show has not gone unnoticed by anti-art buffs nostalgic for the Situationists' hey-day. They have showered the <LOCATION> Pompidou </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> with more than a dozen tracts denouncing the exhibition as a sell-out to the establishment. The show even managed to capture the revolutionary spirit as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> celebrates its bicentennial. An oversized coupon from the Marie-Antoinnette Bakeries reads: `` Good for One Cake.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Today's Blues Hero</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It seems that today's most prominent blues hero, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>, has become a real close friend of the Grammys. This year, his `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark'' single won a Grammy as best contemporary blues recording. It's the title cut from his fifth LP. Last year, his popular `` Strong Persuader'' album won the best contemporary blues recording Grammy. It also has sold more than any blues album in history. The year before that, `` Showdown,'' an album by <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, won the best traditional blues recording Grammy, proving that <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> can be a traditional blues man when he wants to be. He and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> bassist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> recently played on a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> recording. But these are the 1980s, not the heyday of <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> has found his own voice for his own time. `` A lot of people say it's not blues enough,'' he said. `` It does incorporate a lot of rhythm' n' blues.'' His band does n't always use the blues' traditional three-chord progressions. `` I guess the best way to say what the difference would be is that ours is more funky, more danceable, more current, more in tune with what's going on,'' he said. He also is n't figuring just how much rhythm' n' blues influence to use or calculating music toward sales or black radio. `` We do n't think about anything like that,'' he said. `` We go in to make a good album. We're not trying to make anything else out of it. The more uptempo dance things are rhythm' n' blues. The sadder songs are blues. Top 40 singles _ those are n't the intentions. `` We do n't get too much play on black radio stations. We do n't fit their format, which is more dance and a lot of rap The music we're doing is too thick, too serious. `` We get a lot of play on album-oriented rock stations; the singles are sometimes on contemporary hits stations. We've been heard on jazz stations. A lot of older jazz stuff is basically blues riffs.'' For <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, a blues is a sad or lonely song and somebody in it is blue: `` When you go in to record, it's kind of embarrassing. It's spilling your guts. He wrote three of the 10 songs on `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark'' and collaborated on two more. Producers <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> do some of the songwriting. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> wrote `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark.'' Band members Cousins, drummer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> and keyboardist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boe </PERSON> also write. <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> was recently in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a sold-out engagement at Radio City Music Hall. But the veteran of 15 years on the road does n't get caught up in praise, though fame has allowed him to be freer on stage. `` The excitement level is way up. They're familiar with a lot of songs you're going to do. A lot of people are in your corner. You're free to do pretty much what you want It does make it just a step more comfortable.'' His current tour started last May, though his LP was released until August. The band played in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The tour ends here in June and runs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> until next August. Thinking back, <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> recalled, `` I was taken with <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> the first time I heard him, in 1969 at an outdoor festival in southern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. He got my attention playing guitar behind his back and walking out into the audience with a long guitar cable. I was 15 or 16. I was pretty impressed. I was playing guitar at the time.'' <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>, who is less of an extrovert, has n't appropriated <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' tricks `` That's not my personality. ... I guess I'm just not that kind of guy.'' In 1971, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> played at <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s high school graduation. `` The class voted for him; he had done a lot of work in the area,'' he said. `` I met him at the party during his break. I asked him about his band and his music. The next time I saw him was 1976. He remembered talking to me.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> and Cousins, both sons of career servicemen, met near <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>. In January 1974, they moved to <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to start a blues band. `` We decided to get out of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> and go down there and start working with drummer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who had gone to school in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> worked well with him We were a trio for awhile. ... We had a succession of different players,'' he said. `` We played rhythm' n' blues and blues in the bars in <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, did an occasional gig in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, through 1974 and 1975. In 1976 we started traveling to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> backing <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> and doing some gigs on our own. `` Personnel changed in 1979. We started to work <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, occasionally <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and more into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It was n't until 1983 we were able to go across the country.'' They made their first recording in 1978 after meeting producer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> at a blues festival in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But `` Who's Been Talkin''' was n't released until 1980 because the label they were on, Tomato, had problems <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> currently records for Mercury. <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> remembers that festival. `` It was a lot of fun. We were the last act on Sunday afternoon. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> joined us. We were the highlight of the show. It was a big thing for us. We got our picture in the paper. `` Tomato folded about six months later,'' he said. `` We continued to work up and down the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. In 1982 we ran into <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> again. He and a friend of his started <ORGANIZATION> Hightone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. We were the first on it. ` Bad Influence' was released in 1983. That's what enabled us to go across country.'' `` False Accusations'' was released in 1985 but it was `` Strong Persuader,'' the first <PERSON> Cray </PERSON> album distributed by a major record company, which shot him to prominence. <PERSON> Cray </PERSON>, who has too busy to look, has friends searching for a house for him to buy in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state a whole lot,'' he says. `` It's gorgeous in the summertime. But we got spoiled. After we finished touring in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in November 1987, we took a couple of months off in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to get material together and from January to April we made the latest record. The sun was shining all the time.''

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> knew the dirt roads and outhouses of the Great Smoky and <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, but her travels and talks with the people of the region fueled a passion to have those voices heard. `` This is the nuts and bolts of social history. So much of what they had to say is lost,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who put her photographs and portraits of the hundreds of people she interviewed in the area in a new book called `` Mountain Voices.'' She took a leave of absence from her teaching job at a private school in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, leased an apartment in her hometown of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> and taught a few days a week so she could spend more time in the mountains. `` I spent most of my time on the dirt roads where the blacktop had ended,'' she said. `` I wanted to see what they had to say. I found out how little I did know about these people. I became caught up in it. I wanted their voices to be heard. `` The stereotype is they're lazy, barefooted hillbillies,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, now an educational consultant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I had gone to the mountains of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> all my life as a summer person, and this was n't the view I had at all.'' The 38-year-old author found herself going back to the southern Appalachians every chance she got. Then she would bring back her tape-recorded interviews and sit up all night and listen. `` I realized I needed to capture it before it was gone,'' she said. She gained the confidence of people who do not typically give interviews _ farmers, homemakers, raccoon hunters, mountain musicians, craftsmen and <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. `` I found the people are very different from one area to another,'' she said. `` There's lots of different kinds of people. You do n't get that from any stereotype. `` These people are very private individuals. They need to get to know you before they open up.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> would begin her conversations by saying that her intention was to portray the mountain residents on their own terms. `` I wanted their views, their opinions,'' she said. `` I wanted them to talk about themselves.'' The book comes as oral history, as the words of the people themselves. `` These people make quite good philosophers,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` They realize what is important. If something is difficult, they make a joke about it and go on with their life.'' People like <PERSON> Bea </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, a blacksmith from Spruce Pine: `` My theory is that you were born to live and not make a living,'' he says in the book. `` Making a living comes secondary. Anyone can make a living. Not everybody can live. And your monetary value does n't have anything to do with it. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> believes the book should help clear up some of the misconceptions about the people who inhabit the mountains of western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` They are portrayed as people who did n't go to school and who do n't send their kids to school,'' she said. Instead, the offspring of some of those she interviewed had graduated from college, and some had even gone on to graduate school. `` This is n't my book, it's theirs,'' she said. `` Every one of them is special in their own way. These people are my best friends and I care about them.''

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As country music performer <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> left her dressing room to entertain recently, backup singer <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> greeted her with the show business phrase `` break a leg.'' `` I probably will,'' she quipped. The reason she fears for her lower extremities is that she has just added some fancy footwork to her Las Vegas-style act. Inspired by the recent movie `` Big,'' she has purchased a `` walking piano'' like the one actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> played in the hit film. The instrument is a flat, long series of adjoining keys that sit on the ground. They are played by stepping on them. <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON>, 34, whose sisters, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irlene </PERSON>, also are country music performers, is now using the unusual piano in her act. `` It's a novelty,'' she said in an interview before playing the instrument on <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV. `` It's a toy that will be interesting to people. It's fun; we've been giggling half the day away when we practice.'' The electronic piano, which costs $ 15,000, weighs 600 pounds and is 14 feet long. It has 40 keys -LRB- 24 white and 16 black -RRB- which require 30 pounds of pressure to make a sound. It came in two sections, and her road crew put it together and made some technical adjustments to amplify the sound to make it better for settings such as showrooms. She will place a mirror behind her so the audience will be able to watch the intricate foot work. `` It's a toy,'' she said. `` An expensive toy.'' Three other members of her act will join her on the keys. They hop on and off and quickly move to different spots along the keys. The performance looks something like a Chinese fire drill where all four have hot feet. She did n't have to hire a choreographer to take advantage of her costly new prop. `` It's not really dancing,'' she said. `` It's playing an instrument with your feet.'' In the movie, <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> is a boy who suddenly physically becomes a man but responds at the level of a child. He and his boss, a toy company executive, hop on the piano at the toy store and play a `` Chopsticks'' duet. `` I loved it,'' <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> said about the film. `` Movies usually bomb when I love them, but not this one. I love kids. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> was believable as a child. I'm a big fan of his.'' R.C. <PERSON> Bannon </PERSON>, her husband who is a country songwriter, suggested they buy one and put it in her act. They called a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> toy store, ordered one and it arrived crated up in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> accompanied by a piece of paper with a telephone number to call with questions. She began rehearsing on the piano in February. She knows of no other performer who has incorporated the instrument into his or her act. `` It's not like the piano where you just sit and do your piece,'' she said. `` Believe me, it's a lot of work. `` I play the -LRB- regular -RRB- piano, so it's not like a whole new experience. And I dance, so the experience helped.'' <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON>, known to many TV viewers for her shampoo commercials, said she wo n't be too worried about hitting a wrong key. `` The fans like me because I'm not perfect,'' she said. The first two songs she learned on her new instrument are `` Down Yonder'' and `` The William Tell Overture.'' `` ` Down Yonder' is a standard country song,'' she said. `` The country music fans know ` The William Tell Overture' but it reaches the non-country fans too. It's challenging.'' She does n't plan to carry the new piano to the dusty fairs where nearly all country music stars perform in the summer. `` It's too big, too fragile. I do n't think it could endure the road. But people could set it up at home and it would last forever.'' She and her sisters starred in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> show `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandrell </PERSON> and the Mandrell Sisters'' for two seasons beginning in 1980. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, whose specialty is playing the fiddle, now performs in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> about 12 weeks a year plus makes records and does other appearances. Irlene, whose talent runs more toward comedy, is currently on the syndicated TV show `` Hee Haw.'' <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> appears periodically on TV specials and has recently resumed her recording career. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> recently has been the opening act for ageless <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` He watched every one of my shows and made all these cute comments. He's really a lot of fun,'' she said. She said he's amusing even offstage and enjoys fostering his image as a ladies' man. He sent her candy one day with this note attached: `` We were great together last night.''

<HEAD>A Significant Archaeological Find, But What Does It Mean?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LUXOR, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery of five ancient statues has transformed a tranquil courtyard of <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> into an archaeologist's dream. `` We want to discover who buried the statues, why and when,'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> area's director of antiquities, said as diggers' picks and shovels turn the silty earth in search of more statues. Since the Jan. 22 discovery of the well-preserved statues, experts have debated whether more lie near them beside towering columns on the north side of the courtyard of Pharaoh <PERSON> Amenophis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who ruled <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1391-1353 B.C. The courtyard, just over 57 yards long by 50 -LCB- yards wide, is considered the glory of <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a fabled remain altered and reworked by many of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s best-known rulers. On a recent Sunday, four of the statues, covered in padded vinyl and tied so only their toes peeked out, sat in their burial pit. Workers dug around them as small boys carted basketfuls of dirt to mounds near an outer temple wall on which Ramses II, in a chariot, smites the ill-fated enemies of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Each digger hopes to be the next el-Rayees <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON>, chief of temple workers, who was credited with finding the edge of a buried granite statue base that had shielded the figures from generations of footsteps. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON>, in a brown galabeya, or robe, his head swathed in the traditional scarf of southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, shouted orders to his men as they excavated. They've found no additional large statues, but <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON> said the dig had turned up a small bronze of the god Osiris, lord of the underworld; part of a stela or commemorative plaque; copper tools, and other small artifacts. Some light has been shed on mysteries of the discovery, one of a number of group burials by ancient Egyptians. `` We know this burial was not accidental,'' <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON> said. `` These statues were placed lovingly in the earth, their sides turned toward the west. Not only did the ancients protect the statues by putting a base over them, but they took the care to seal the pit with a layer of gypsum and limestone chips. They wanted to save them for eternity.'' The base, a granite slab with two niches carved in it, apparently once held two of the statues found in January. The general, and later pharaoh, <PERSON> Haremhab </PERSON>, knelt in a rounded-off rectangle with offerings before a seated creator god, Atum, that fit in a rectangular niche, according to measurements. A third statue found in January is of the goddess <PERSON> Hathor </PERSON>, patron of beauty and womanhood, and the fourth is a minor goddess, <PERSON> Yunet </PERSON>. Originally, the base lay on the ground inside the temple. At some time, for reasons unknown, the ancients decided to bury the statues. They put them in a hole, covered it with dirt, gypsum and stone, then put the base on top and covered it with dirt _ much like the layers in a sandwich. <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON> and others think the base may have provided protection, or may have had some magical significance. It only actually covers a quartzite statue of Amenophis III, which <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON> said was the most important find. The statue depicts Amenophis III standing on a sledge to demonstrate his divinity. Tomb paintings and small wooden statues exist showing him in such a pose, but the stone statue standing more than eight feet tall is unique. Over 34 centuries Amenophis III has remained among ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s most fascinating personalities. Early in his reign he claimed to have killed 102 fierce lions. He brags in heiroglyphs on the new statue that he controls land from <LOCATION> Nubia </LOCATION>, ranging from southern <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> through what is now northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the east to the <LOCATION> Taurus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. In later life, <PERSON> Amenophis </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> preferred luxury to prowess. A patron of the arts, he demanded magnificent monuments and the finest works craftsmen could produce. The five statues show the masters' touch, and conservation experts from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> will have the job of ensuring their safety in the modern world. They have been moved from the courtyard to a special storage area at <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saghir </PERSON> said he's just beginning to have the time to think about what's been found. `` Finding something by surprise and discovering it in a regular excavation give different feelings,'' he said. `` The first night after these statues were found I could n't sleep I went to <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> at 11 p.m. and walked in the moonlight. I went home. At 2 a.m. I went again to the Temple. I was trying to decide what to do next. I was so afraid something would happen to them. I knew at first sight we had a cache.'' The statues may have been put in hiding for safekeeping during the Assyrian invasion, he said. That west <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> empire conquered <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 671 B.C., and for years its soldiers ransacked and plundered monuments throughout the country. However, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> suffered ups and downs as early as 100 years after <PERSON> Amenophis </PERSON> built <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, when the pharaohs began to decline after the 66-year reign of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and that may account for the statues' burial. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadelmann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and one of the profession's most respected scholars, said he believes the order in which the statues were buried gives history a hint. `` The best choice'' for the time of burial would have been during the reign of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who expanded and redesigned <ORGANIZATION> Luxor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` Perhaps they bothered <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> in some way or interfered with his processions.'' He reasons that the statues were grouped as they are for a reason. `` To me they represent the west, the setting sun,'' <PERSON> Stadelmann </PERSON> said. `` If this is true, then we can expect in the opposite courtyard to find another grouping, this time representing the east, the rising sun.'' He characterized his ideas as fantasies because the discovery is so new, but said he expects that the statues lined the sides of the festival courtyard in ancient times to produce a processional journey for the sun god. `` We have these processions painted on walls, but in this case it could have been done with statues. To the ancients it would n't have mattered if the pharaoh were dead or if the statues later were buried ... `` The journey would continue.''

 Bridges, buildings, trains and planes that monitor their own structural well-being sound like science fiction, but they're results of new technology that lets scientists test things without destroying them. `` Our work is like re-inventing the wheel and making it work better,'' said physicist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Non-Destructive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> he started in 1971 at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Langley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> The lab uses an array of measurement techniques _ thermal diffusion, ultrasonics, acoustics, magnetism, X-rays, lasers and holography _ to probe for internal defects in objects like space shuttle solid rocket motors, satellites, airplane wings, train wheels and railroad tracks _ and even ordinary bolts. Then there are `` smart'' materials that take care of themselves. `` We're investigating how to incoporate sensors directly into materials,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said. `` It's easy with fiber-like materials like composites _ a fiber optic line is buried in the structure. An aircraft wing can be made the same way, and the same applies to larger structure like the space station.'' The technology is especially critical for the space station expected to be built in thes, lasers and holography _ to probe for internal defects in objects like space shuttle solid rocket motors, satellites, airplane wings, train wheels and railroad tracks _ and even ordinary bolts.

The technology is especially critical for the space station expected to be built in the 1990s because it will be a permanently orbiting platform bombarded by cosmic dust and stressed by temperature differences. Less glamorous would be its use in bridges, buildings, oil platforms and pipelines, `` anything where you need to measure strain, stress and temperature,'' said <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>. Smart materials will sense that something may be malfunctioning before a major problem develops, he said. `` This nervous system we're building will be able to sense when we need help.

 As a plant, grass is taken more or less for granted. It grows. It gets mowed, watered and fertilized. It grows more. `` There's not just that much attention to it,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON>, a turf researcher for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But everybody's got grass to cut.'' <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON>, who estimates he's one of just a dozen turf breeders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would like to see the care given to grass become even easier. He and a staff of 11 have 20 acres of grass in College Station, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. One objective of their research is to give the homeowner `` a much higher quality plant with less input, less care, less maintenance,'' he said. `` And in the program we're introducing grasses that wo n't have to be mowed as frequently or grasses that produce little or no clippings. Homeowners, though, are n't the only people who stand to benefit from <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON>'s research. Most people believe turf is just there to look pretty, but its main purpose is to stabilize and conserve the landscape. <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON> hopes to introduce two new grasses this year to the grass-growing industry _ a $ 25 billion business nationwide. One is a buffalo grass capable of growing from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the northern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; the other is a zoysia grass adaptable along the southern tier of states from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The buffalo grass will be introduced to growers this year and available to the public in about three years. It would grow to only about four inches, need little or no fertilizer and pesticides, and crowd out less desirable grasses. <PERSON> Engelke </PERSON> wants it to be called `` Prairie Buffalo Grass'' because it reminds him of the rippling, wind-blown grass crossed by prairie schooners.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Chiefs Expect Harmony And Few Changes In $18 Billion
Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It took two years of negotiations before <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> could agree to create the world's biggest media and entertainment concern through an $ 18 billion merger. But the executives who will head the new company say their protracted talks have paved the way to a harmonious future. `` I do n't know of an item we did n't explore,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said Sunday. `` That is one of the things that makes me feel very secure in the future.'' Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday they would join forces in a merger of equals that would value the combined company, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 18 billion and would rank it as the biggest media conglomerate in the world, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Bertlesmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would have projected annual revenues of $ 10 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Bertlesmann </ORGANIZATION> recorded 1987 revenue of $ 6 billion. The agreement between Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> followed two years of on-again, off-again talks between the two New York-based companies. The most-recent hiatus occurred as <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> pursued a $ 1.2 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, but the negotiations picked up steam after <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> completed that acquisition in January. Saturday's announcement also followed years of takeover speculation about Time that sparked periodic surges in the company's stock price The company shored up its defenses from time to time, most recently by extending its stock buyback plan and amending its shareholder rights plan in January. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> _ who will serve as co-chairman and co-chief executive officer of the new company along with <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> _ said Sunday of the merger, `` This is an offensive move, not a defensive move. However, it is impossible to ignore the fact that the combination of Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> literally gives the two companies solidarity in the face of a trend toward consolidation in the media industry. Publishers including <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> have gone on shopping sprees in recent years, building media conglomerates that would have found either Time or <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to be an attractive takeover candidate. The deal calls for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to receive 0.465 share of Time for each share of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> they own. Since there are potentially 177.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> common shares, and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> closed Friday at $ 109.12 -LCB- a share, that puts a value on <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 9 billion if the deal had closed Friday. In addition, there are 56.6 million shares of Time outstanding, giving it a market value of a little more than $ 6 billion based on Friday's close. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 45.87 -LCB- on Friday. Debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the $ 18 billion market value of the proposed new company. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies and by the federal government. Because the deal is a merger of equals rather than an acquisition, it can not be directly compared to such megadeals as the record $ 24.53 billion leveraged buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> last month. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said in an interview there was no one factor that enabled the two sides to finally reach agreement. `` I'm not sure anything happened,'' he said. `` I think there is a certain time when things really begin to come together.'' The price of the merger was not a problem, according to <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. `` Ninety percent of the discussions had to do with people, logistics and future plans,'' he said. Both executives said the congeniality of their contacts over the past two years cemented a relationship that will make it easy for them to work together as co-CEOs. It wo n't be the first <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> has served as a co-CEO. He and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON> shared the top job at <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 until <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>'s death in 1971. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> will serve together until <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, 58, retires and becomes chairman of the executive committee of the combined company. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> will be succeeded as co-CEO by <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, currently the president of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and who will hold that same post at <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Upon the eventual retirement of <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who is 61, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> is expected to be sole head of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Few immediate changes are expected in the structure of the new company. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said there were no plans to sell any parts of either <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> or Time, and they did not expect any layoffs as a result of the combination. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was reluctant to discuss what <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s plans were, but did say he expected the biggest impact of the merger to be on the company's overseas operations. Time is the nation's leading magazine company, with such titles as Time, People and Sports Illustrated, along with <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> and the Book-of-the-Month Club. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> has major movie and television production interests, including <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> cable television operations would be merged with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s, creating the second-largest cable operation in the country, behind <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Time's cable holdings include Home Box Office and <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> also expected <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s book division to become part of Time's larger publishing empire. The merger announcement came nearly two months after <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> completed its long-delayed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> agreed on a merger last May, but the deal was n't finalized until January because of stumbling blocks raised by <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest stockholder. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> have been at loggerheads for years, quarreling not only about <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, but about <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' salary and the makeup of the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board. How much of a thorn <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> will be in the side of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> remains to be seen. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said it was not yet known if <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who sits on the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> board, will also be a director of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s stake in the new company will decline to between 6 percent and 7 percent from his current 11 percent <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> share, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Chris-Craft bought its stake of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 to help <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fight a takeover attempt by <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Some Questions And Answers About The Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are some key questions in the 17-month labor dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its Machinists union. Q: Who is on strike? A: The 8,500 Eastern workers who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. They are about equally divided between aircraft mechanics and ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle baggage and drive motorized equipment on airport runways. Q: How much do Machinists make? A: Mechanics at Eastern earn a top wage of $ 18.83 an hour. That compares with $ 16 at non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18.78 at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, $ 20.05 at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 20.10 at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. Ramp service workers earn a top hourly wage of $ 15.60. Comparable workers earn $ 15.51 an hour at American, $ 15.93 at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, $ 16.53 at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, $ 16.57 at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and $ 17.47 at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> contracts for the work. Q: What does each side want? A: Eastern is seeking $ 150 million in wage and benefit concessions to help stem mounting losses at the airline. The Machinists want $ 50 million in raises but last week offered to delay increases for 15 months. Q: How has the dispute evolved? A: The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal talks began in October 1987. Pilots and flight attendants a year earlier reached concessionary agreements with the airline that slashed pay 20 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> intervened in the dispute in January 1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massive layoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last month after Eastern rejected binding arbitrtion and the mediation board declared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike. More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized a strike. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to intervene to delay the strike. Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13 percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. It was rejected Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. Q: Could the Eastern strike affect other modes of transportation? A: Yes. The National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycotts in air and rail travel. If rail union workers honor pickets, traffic on the nation's 12 commuter railroads and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> could be severely disrupted. Also, other airlines could be picketed and the 14 million-member <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has asked its members to honor the Machinists strike. However, the union decided Sunday to appeal a judge's order barring such secondary boycotts in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area and said it would not picket any railroads Monday. Q: What is Eastern's financial condition? A: Eastern says it has lost more than $ 1 billion this decade and is losing more than $ 1 million a day. It also has $ 2.5 billion in debt. The airline was bought by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in February 1986 and since then has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restore profitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunk to about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cut profitable routes, closed its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, hub and taken smaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on some flights. Eastern has about $ 400 million in cash to help it meet its financial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pending sale of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will bring in about $ 365 million. Q: Why is Eastern ailing? A: Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands and says it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to make sacrifices. Labor maintains <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is suffering because it did n't react aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in 1978 In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for future profits that never materialized and stock. <PERSON> Tey </PERSON> do n't want further concessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-term commitment to its financial fitness. The unions also claim <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> wants to strip the airline of assets or dissolve it. Q: What are the strike's possible effects? A: The strike threatens to force the 60-year-old airline into bankruptcy. To forestall its demise, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could lay off striking workers and sell other assets, such as planes, airport gates or international routes, to raise cash. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> could sell the airline, and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been among potential buyers who recently have expressed interest. A separate settlement with pilots, who are honoring the strike, could allow the airline to keep more planes airborne. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could change his mind and appoint an emergency panel that would force the Machinists to return to work for 60 days.

<HEAD>Former Utility Chairman Arrested in Recruit Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today arrested the former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on suspicion of bribery in a stock-profiteering scandal that has shaken <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s political and business elite. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> District Prosecutor's Office said <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, 78, was arrested with his 63-year-old secretary, <PERSON> Kozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murata </PERSON>, on suspicion of receiving bribes in the form of bargain-price shares in a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate with business links to the giant telecommunications utility. Authorities also said they searched Shinto's home. Shinto was known as an advocate of clean government and business until December, when he was forced to resign from the chairmanship of <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> as a result of the scandal. Today's arrests follow the announcement Saturday that prosecutors in the case had indicted four people on bribery charges, including the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another Recruit executive and two former <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> officials. The Recruit figures were indicted on charges of offering bribes, and the former <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> officials were accused of accepting bribes. Prosecutors suspect that in exchange for bribes, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> gave Recruit special favors in the resale of U.S.-made Cray supercomputers and reduced rates on leased communications circuits, news reports say. The Recruit scandal has shaken confidence in the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Three members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> have resigned under fire for links to the Recruit company. A total of 10 people have now been arrested in the case on charges of bribery or violating securities and exchange laws. Five have been indicted, including one who allegedly tried to bribe an opposition legislator into easing off in an investigation into the affair. Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted shares of the real estate subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Recruit-Cosmos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent figures through September 1986. An estimated 160 people purchased the prelisted shares and were then able to reap large, tax-free profits shortly after they were offered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986. Shinto's secretary reportedly made about $ 157,000 and <ORGANIZATION> Shinto </ORGANIZATION> earned about $ 71,000. When the transaction was revealed in detail in December, Shinto said he had not known of it and that his secretary had controlled the account. Shinto had headed <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> since 1981 and oversaw its conversion to a private company during the administration of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who was among politicians whose aides or relatives profited from transactions in the stocks. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who is also among those figures, has repeatedly denied direct involvement in the scandal. On Sunday, he took responsibility for the scandal but pledged to restore confidence by pursuing political reform, a published report said. `` The Recruit case ... surfaced during my term as prime minister so there is no way for me to escape responsibility,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was quoted as saying in today's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demands for the resignation of his entire Cabinet. Public support for the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> has dropped steadily over the past five months due to the scandal, as well as government plans to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in commercial transactions, according to media polls.

<HEAD>Hazardous Waste Entrepreneurs Say Business is Booming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forget plastics. The glow is off computers. Hazardous waste disposal is the high-tech growth industry of the 1990s. So say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs, executives and consultants who attended a two-day conference on how to profit from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toxic waste problem. `` Two or three years ago if you'd said you're having a hazardous waste business conference, you'd get very few people showing up,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irish </PERSON>, whose company extracts heavy metals from contaminated wastewater. But it was standing room only at a session last week in the Copley Plaza Hotel's ornate ballroom. The subject: `` Identifying Market Opportunities in the Hazardous Waste Industry,'' or, as one person attending put it, `` Given that companies do n't publicize their hazardous waste problems, how do we identify potential customers?'' Other sessions covered how to comply with environmental regulations, how to minimize legal liability, `` Surviving Hypergrowth'' and `` Preventing Your Employees from Becoming Your Archrivals,'' or how to protect toxic trade secrets. The beverage served everywhere was mineral water. Hazardous waste processing will be a $ 5 billion industry this year and could hit $ 12 billion by 1994, said conference organizer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Golob </PERSON>, publisher of the weekly newsletter `` Harzardous Materials Intelligence Report.'' There's no shortage of stuff to clean up. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has identified 30,000 potentially hazardous sites, of which 1,000 qualify for Superfund clean-up money. According to <PERSON> Golob </PERSON>, other surveys have estimated that up to 430,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination. And the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that of managing, disposing and cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at its facilities could cost from $ 53 billion to $ 92 billion, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said. The manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, consumer products and even decaffeinated coffee produces hazardous waste. As environmental regulations get stiffer, companies that can deal with infectious waste, radioactive contamination and dirty drinking water are in special demand. Irish's enterprise was born in 1988 from tougher state and federal groundwater regulations. Electroplating plants produce rinsewater that includes heavy metals, including nickel, lead and a carcinogenic chromium compound, said <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> UNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, a Mulberry, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> UNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. UNC Reclamation installs equipment that extracts metals from rinsewater, Irish said The residue is turned into metal salts that can be sold back to the electroplaters, he said. The service costs electroplaters less than disposing their metallic sludge in landfills. And it eliminates their long-term legal liability, Irish said. The process also ensures that no contaminants will leak from a landfill into groundwater. `` Clearly it's the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep anything from going into the ground,'' Irish said. `` Reclamation is what they want.'' UNC Reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are expected to hit $ 12 million this year, he said. The company plans to expand into cleaning up toxic sludge from batteries that have been dumped into some <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, lagoons. The environmental boom already has produced some hazardous waste millionaires, <PERSON> Golob </PERSON> said. One high-tech entrepreneur is <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKim </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1980 at age 25. The company said it now has nearly 1,000 employees and had sales of $ 73 million last year. But the industry has to cope with more than its share of regulation and red tape, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, vice president of <PERSON> DartAmerica </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Freehold </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DartAmerica </PERSON> transports toxic, low-level nuclear and solid waste to approved disposal sites. It is regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, and has an array of permits that allow it to truck waste in 48 states. It takes three full-time employees just to handle shipping permits, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, PCBs are regulated and -LRB- waste -RRB- oil is n't. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, oil is regulated but PCBs are n't,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. `` You're like a slave to 48 masters.

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Go Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of leaded gasoline jumped more than a penny per gallon during the past two weeks, an analyst said. The increase may signal a long-expected decision by dealers to pass on losses sustained by higher wholesale costs, <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said Sunday. `` It's taken years, but the differential is finally shrinking,'' she said. A March 3 nationwide survey of gasoline stations found the average cost of gasoline for all grades with taxes was 99.22 cents per gallon, up about a half-cent from Feb. 17, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. For the same period, leaded gasoline at self-service stations rose 1.11 cents per gallon, Ms. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. The cost of making leaded gas has risen as environmental laws cut the amount of lead allowed, forcing producers to use costlier substitutes, and as older leaded gas-using cars were taken off the road, she said. Self-service prices on March 3 were 88.87 cents per gallon for regular unleaded, $ 1.0806 for premium unleaded and 86.25 for regular leaded. Full-service prices were $ 1.1857 for regular unleaded, $ 1.3008 for premium unleaded and $ 1.1479 for regular leaded.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle doubled its normal rush hour schedule from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today in the wake of a strike at its competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The shuttle, which normally flies once an hour from each city, was scheduled to fly every half hour today, except for the slow hours between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>.

Noise restrictions prohibited use of Airbuses on flights to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000 passengers on the shuttle Saturday and Sunday, also with a doubled schedule.

<HEAD>Soviets: Need More Scientific Evidence Before Banning CFC's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said today it requires more scientific evidence that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone layer before agreeing to a ban. `` Any decision ... should be well-grounded and should have a firm scientific basis,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>, Soviet delegate to a 120-nation conference on the ozone layer. `` If any fears which some scientists have now ... are proved, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will back any initiative, or will initiate itself the reduction of CFCs,'' he told reporters. Western scientists agree that the compounds, used in refrigeration, air conditioning, aerosols and fast-food packaging, are destroying the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. They say the compounds are responsible for creating an ozone hole roughly the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> every winter. An international team of scientists this winter also found evidence of ozone depletion over the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>, but said it could n't yet prove a link in the region with the compounds <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON>, chairman of the Soviet committee on ozone protection, said Soviet scientists have found evidence of a 25 percent ozone depletion over parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he said it was due primarily to naturally occurring cyclones. `` This process is cyclical and this cycle is 10-15 days, and it was observed in February and in January of this year,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is one of 31 signatories to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which calls for halving production of the compounds by the end of the century. Six more agreed Sunday to abide by its terms _ <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, athe <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have said they want to ban the chemicals by that time. <PERSON> Zhakarov </PERSON> said `` if there is proved scientific date that we should phase out those substances, we will support this idea ... not all the countries support the appeal of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. We must be very cautious here. If we take a decision which is not well grounded, we can interfere and destroy the economies of the developing countries.'' <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, ozone campaign chairman of the environmental group Friends of the Earth-USA, said the Soviets `` have presented a fairly confusing position ... I think what they'd like to do is just buy themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy ... The science is clearly there.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s delegate called for the establishment of an international fund to protect the ozone layer, to be supported mainly by the industrialized countries. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Pu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s environmental commissioner, said the industrialized countries had done most of the damage. He said the developed world produced 80 percent of all the compounds, while <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> produced less than 2 percent. He also proposed that substitutes for the compounds be provided at no cost to developing countries. No substitutes the compounds are available for sale, but industry officials say they hope to have some on the market by the mid-1990s. The compounds can last 100 years, but when they reach the stratosphere, about 15-25 miles above the earth's surface, they break apart and their chlorine atoms destroy ozone. The compounds also trap heat and warm the Earth's surface, a process known as the greenhouse effect, which could cause major climate changes.

 The stock market headed higher today in activity dominated by communications and entertainment issues. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.35 to 2,279.64 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 640 up, 299 down and 465 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 23.65 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might be candidates for mergers or takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock was delayed in opening, while Time's shares dropped 1 -RRB-. Analysts said Time's decline in part reflected disappointment among traders who had been reckoning that the company might have itself become a takeover candidate at a higher price. Elsewhere in the group, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> gained -RCB- to 18 -LRB- and American TV-Communications, traded in the over-the-counter market, jumped 3 \ to 42 Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of economic growth. That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .46 to 164.36.

 A fistfight erupted at a U-Haul stockholders' meeting, punctuating a bitter family struggle over control of the rental empire Witnesses said the fight Saturday involved four sons of U-Haul founder <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, 73. <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, who has sought to regain control of the company since he was forced into retirement in 1986, appeared visibly shaken by the brawl. `` I created a monster,'' he said.

Two other sons, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON>, also sit on the six-member board of directors, which was re-elected Saturday. They were not involved in the fisticuffs. Hotel security guards quickly responded to the fight and broke it up. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON>, who was forced to hold an ice pack to his cheek afterward, said the fight occurred after the stockholders' meeting adjourned. `` They ran it -LRB- meeting -RRB- in the most hough they knew they had the votes they needed to win,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> said. `` They were not willing to allow discussion on anything.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and his supporters declined comment Saturday, but issued a news release pledging a back-to-basics approach in the company's five-year management plan The plan calls for an all-new truck fleet, discontinuation of unprofitable operations, liquidation of unused assets and an employee profit-sharing plan. The elder <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> contended the company has been devalued under <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>'s leadership and no longer adheres to its founding principle of customer satisfaction. He also accused <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> of lending money from a trust fund to several company employees to purchase shares of stock in an effort to retain control of the company. The elder <PERSON> Shoen </PERSON> set the stage for the brawl years ago when he divided 95 percent of the company's stock among 12 children from three marriages. After Saturday's meeting, he said the only way to defuse the situation is to sell the company. `` This will have to be solved and that's the only way to solve it,'' he said. U-Haul is now part of a Nevada-based corporation, <ORGANIZATION> Amerco </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Require Retirement of Airline Flight Engineers</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, today refused to let <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over age 60. The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is bound by an age-bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against Western. A federal judge in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ordered Western in 1981 to abandon its mandatory retirement age of 60 for flight engineers. The judge also permitted pilots to bid for flight engineer jobs when they approached 60, the retirement age for pilots. That ruling stemmed from a suit by 15 flight engineers who accused Western of violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act aimed at protecting older workers. Their victory was upheld in 1985 by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a ruling that set guidelines for enforcing the federal law. When <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> merged with Western in 1987, it sought to force the retirement of the 15 unless they agreed to take on-ground jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> said its offer was in line with its policy barring captains and co-pilots over 60 from becoming flight engineers. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last October that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is bound by the 1981 court order enforcing the flight engineers' victory against Western. `` Delta may be free to execute its own policies to other employees, but it is not free to abrogate -LRB- Western's -RRB- obligations to'' the former Western employees, the appeals court said. `` There is a continuity of operations between the merged airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> had notice of Western's obligations and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has the ability to provide relief.'' Some of the 15 have retired voluntarily. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Criswell </PERSON>, 88-1138.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities law. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> to tell readers whether companies featured in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for other services. The magazine, aimed primarily at small investors, is published 10 times a year in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, by <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinelli </PERSON>, that city's former mayor Each issue contains general financial news and seven or eight articles on specific companies as investment prospects. According to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here, the articles `` describe the featured companies in unabashedly glowing terms'' and never contain a negative report or even mild skepticism. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sued the magazine in 1982, alleging that it violated securities law by failing to disclose `` consideration'' received from those companies described in its feature articles. The suit said such considerations included the purchase of advertising space in the magazine and the purchase from the publisher of article reprints. The commission sought a court order forcing the magazine to tell readers about considerations received in connection with all future articles. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> threw out the civil suit in 1986. He said any order forcing such disclosure would be a `` prior restraint'' on publication, violating the magazine's free-press rights. The judge said, however, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was free to criminally prosecute the magazine for alleged willful violations of the anti-touting provisions. The commission appealed, and the appeals court last June 21 reinstated the civil suit. `` The prior restraint doctrine is not precisely applicable to the requested relief in this case,'' the appeals court ruled. `` Orders that are carefully focused, address a continuing course of speech and are imposed after an opportunity for full merits consideration are not properly analyzed as prior restraints.'' The appeals court sent the case back to the trial court for a determination whether the anti-touting provision was violated. The magazine then sought <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review. It said the appeals court ruling wrongly would allow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to dictate `` a significant element of the content of the articles it publishes, under threat of contempt.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers urged the high court to reject the magazine's appeal as premature. `` The decision of the court of appeals does not ... determine that -LRB- the magazine -RRB- has or has not violated -LRB- the anti-touting provision -RRB- or establish what the terms of any injunction prohibiting future violations of that provision may be,'' the government said. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-982.

<TEXT>
 Airlines and bus companies braced for a heavier-than-usual passenger load today as the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strike continued into its third day with no signs of a settlement. Meanwhile, worried commuters nationwide breathed sighs of relief after a federal judge blocked sympathy walkouts by railroad workers and striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> called off plans to picket about a dozen commuter rail stations. The Eastern strike began Saturday with a walkout by 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew over demands for wage concessions. Most of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants have honored picket lines, virtually shutting down the carrier. Only about 9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,000 daily flights took off Sunday, according to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s usual 100,000 daily passengers at airports nationwide and have left other airlines scrambling to accommodate those travelers <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said its already-busy shuttle doubled its normal rush hour schedule from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today. The shuttle, which usually flies once an hour from each city, planned to fly every half hour today, except for the slow hours between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. She said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planes for 150-seat <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s on some flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000 passengers on the shuttle over the weekend, also with a doubled schedule. It expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekday norm, <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. Eastern's sister company, Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which is also owned by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has `` added some extra sections to already existing flights where there has been market demand, primarily <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' according to spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said that pickets have not gone up against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and that the strike was not having any effect on its operations. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said extra buses were standing by at several <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities today prepared for heavier-than-usual traffic.

We do n't sell out of seats,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. `` We just keep adding buses and sending them out.'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said Greyhound `` should be able to maintain on-time expectations, ... now that the commuter rails are open.'' On Sunday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> signed a temporary restraining order in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> blocking rail workers from sympathy strikes to support striking Eastern employees.

<HEAD>Court Bans Tennessee Age Rule</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to let <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials impose a retirement age of 55 for officers who enforce state wildlife laws. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the state failed to show that physical fitness and a healthy heart are necessary to do the job. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last October struck down the mandatory retirement age for officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The officers' duties include investigating violations of hunting and fishing laws and arresting suspects. The appeals court said the age limit violates the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act aimed at protecting the rights of older workers. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> officials said wildlife officers also are responsible for rescuing boaters and water skiers, work long hours in bad weather and face life-threatening situations. The strenuous nature of the job is too demanding for those 55 and older, the state officials said, because older officers are more likely to be unfit and suffer from heart disease. But the 6th Circuit court said the state undermined its case by not requiring physical fitness tests or heart examinations for any officers, and by permitting some officers to stay on past age 55 due to economic hardship or political pressure. Such waivers of the mandatory retirement age `` were granted without any determinations as to job performance, physical ability or physical fitness,'' the appeals court said. Therefore, it said, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> `` has not treated physical and coronary fitness as reasonably necessary to the position of wildlife officer.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 said the federal age-bias law requires employers to show that employee qualifications _ such as physical fitness _ are reasonably necessary to carry out the employer's work. The court also said in that ruling that an employer must show that workers over a certain age lack such qualifications, or that it is impractical to test the workers individually to determine whether they are so qualified. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, representing the federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in the case, said the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> dispute has limited application.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs increased by four this week to total 761, continuing a seesaw trend that saw a slight boost with the addition of 20 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> rigs, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The count dropped by nine last week to total 757, following an increase of 20 rigs in the previous week, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. A year ago, the rig count was 978. The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the rig count since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to revive lawsuits by <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that sought government reimbursement for more than $ 35 million paid or owed to shipyard workers suffering from asbestos-related diseases and injuries. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw the suits by <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> out of a federal claims court. Thousands of workers exposed to products containing asbestos made by <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> have sued the company. Many of the workers were employed at government-owned shipyards, others at privately owned shipyards that built or repaired ships for the government. Many of the claims date back to World War II. <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> sought reimbursement from the government, contending that federal officials negligently approved use of asbestos in shipbuilding. The company also accused the government of failing to protect and warn workers about the hazards of exposure to asbestos. The corporation filed suits in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION>, a court here that handles various claims against the federal government. The claims court threw out the suits and a federal appeals court upheld the dismissal. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> is barred from seeking reimbursement in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> because the corporation also sued the government in a federal district court in another asbestos-related matter. The related case sought reimbursement for $ 45,000 <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> paid a worker injured by asbestos exposure after 1963. The appeals court said the fact that the cases stem from asbestos exposure some 20 years apart does not permit <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> to seek recovery in the claims court while also seeking reimbursement in federal district court for a similar claim. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Johns-Manville </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-1052.

<HEAD>Michigan Law on Minority-Owned Businesses Found Unconstitutional</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law that required 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minority-owned businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women was unconstitutional, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The justices, without issuing any written opinion, upheld a federal appeals court's invalidation of the law. In a Jan. 23 decision, the high court itself struck down a similar affirmative action plan that set aside 30 percent of all city construction contracts in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for minority-owned businesses. In that ruling, the justices made it far more difficult for local governments, and by extension state governments, to impose strict racial quotas as part of affirmative action plans. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> program, enacted in 1980, was unlawful because there was inadequate evidence of past discrimination by the state against minorities and women. State officials `` have relied upon certain conclusory historical resumes of unrelated legislative enactments and proposed enactments, executive reports and a state-funded private study conducted in 1974,'' the appeals court said. `` This documentation is not reflective of discriminatory action by the state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' The appeals court said there was `` little if any probative evidence'' of discrimination against minority groups, and it said evidence of discrimination against women `` is non-existent.'' The minority groups covered by the program are blacks, Hispanics, Orientals, Eskimos and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. State officials said the quota figures were based on the percentage of businesses in the state owned by minorities and women. The set-asides were challenged by various contractors doing business with the state, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 upheld a federal law that set aside 10 percent of federal contracts for minority owned businesses.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Rate Restructuring Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected an appeal by a group of rural electric cooperatives challenging the authority of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials to restructure rates charged to customers. The court, citing the lack of `` a properly presented federal question,'' let stand a ruling supported by major oil companies that buy power from the cooperative group. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last July that the state's public utility commission acted properly when it ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Ute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to redesign its rates The association, comprised of 14 rural electric cooperatives, had been charging what is known as a flat rate _ one not taking into account the differences between fixed capital costs and variable energy costs that fluctuate depending on fuel needs and costs. The utility commission ordered the cooperative association to adopt a pricing setup that reflects separate charges for capital and energy costs and varies according to seasonal demands of customers. The association's power needs generally are greater in winter. Supporting the change ordered by the state officials were <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the public utility commission had adequate grounds to order the cooperative association to restructure its rates because the old system resulted in `` an uneconomic under-utilitization of capacity.'' `` Rates charged should accurately reflect the utility's actual cost of providing service, including both capital costs and operating expenses,'' the state court said. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the cooperative association also argued that its constitutional rights were violated because the public utility commission based its findings in part on a key computer analysis that the association was barred from challenging adequately. The cooperatives said the they did not have an opportunity to examine the computer program and supporting documents. The coops also said the state regulators interfered with the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency, to regulate the cooperative utilities. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Ute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has 14 members. One member, <ORGANIZATION> Empire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, opposed the appeal by the other 13. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Ute </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION>, 88-977.

 Wheat futures prices opened mostly higher but corn and soybeans were mostly lower this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting a mixed bag of weather in key growing areas over the weekend.

Union Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair treatment. The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the federal Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 does not `` provide a private cause of action to enforce federal employees unions' duty of fair representation.'' The court ruled against <PERSON> Efthinios </PERSON> <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON>, a Greek language instructor at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> had worked for the institute for nearly 20 years when in 1976 he was promoted to the higher-paying position of course developer Greek language instructor <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntelos </PERSON> objected to the promotion and filed a grievance with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the institute's workers. <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> is not a member of the union, but it represents him in collective bargaining. <PERSON> Kuntelos </PERSON> is a union member. The union decided to arbitrate <PERSON> Kuntelos </PERSON>' grievance without telling <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> about it. After a hearing not attended by <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON>, an arbitrator cleared the way for <PERSON> Kuntelos </PERSON>, in effect, to get <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON>' job. <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> objected to his demotion, but the union refused to arbitrate in his behalf. He filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. But the union and <ORGANIZATION> FLRA </ORGANIZATION> settled the case when the union agreed to state it would not undertake similar acts in the future. <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> then filed a federal court suit against the union. A federal judge said the union breached its duty to give <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> fair representation and ordered the union to pay his lawyer fees. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned the ruling and threw out the suit. In upholding the appeals court decision, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said today that federal workers do not have the same relationship to unions as privately employed workers. The court enforcement procedures for private collective-bargaining contracts do not apply to federal employees covered by the civil service act, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. The case is <PERSON> Karahalios </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, 87-636.

<HEAD>Court Says Contract Dispute Between Stanford, Computer Firm Should

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today said a contract dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a computer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration. The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and a setback for <ORGANIZATION> Volt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which had asked the justices to compel arbitration. Writing for the court, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ not federal _ law governs the case. The dispute developed when <PERSON> Volt </PERSON> submitted a claim for additional compensation for extra work it said it performed installing a system of electrical conduits connecting computer facilities on the university campus in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The contract signed by <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Volt </PERSON> contained a provision that any dispute would be submitted to binding arbitration. The contract also specified, in typical contractual language, that the pact would be `` governed by the law of the place where the project is located.'' When Volt demanded that its claim for additional compensation be arbitrated, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> sued in state court. Its suit alleged breach of contract against Volt and two other companies with whom <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> did not have arbitration agreements. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> courts ruled that the contract dispute should be resolved in state court, and not in arbitration, because of a state law allowing arbitration to be postponed pending lawsuits involving third parties not bound by the arbitration. In seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, lawyers for <PERSON> Volt </PERSON> said the company was being deprived of its arbitration rights under the Federal Arbitration Act. But <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> wrote today that such rights are not absolute, and may be overridden by agreements to let state law govern. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> dissented, and Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> did not participate in the case.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle doubled its normal rush hour schedule from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today in the wake of a strike at its competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern, however, had crews available and was operating its shuttle today, said spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Four out of eight scheduled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flights left by 10 a.m. _ two to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and two to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ and the others were canceled because of snow, not the strike, he said. Eastern also got off one non-shuttle flight _ to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> _ from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> this morning, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Eastern was not operating from the other New York-area airports, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. The shuttle crews were made up of a combination of union employees who crossed picket lines and airline managers pressed into duty, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. He said he did not know how many passengers were on the Eastern shuttle flights; the man who usually tracked such figures was `` out throwing bags.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle, which normally flies once an hour from each city, was scheduled to fly every half hour today, except for the slow hours between 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., said spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. Pan Am also planned to substitute 250-seat Airbus planes for 150-seat <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s on some flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. Noise restrictions prohibited use of Airbuses on flights to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> carried twice its usual weekend load of 3,000 passengers on the shuttle Saturday and Sunday, also with a doubled schedule. It expected 10,000 passengers today, double the weekday norm, <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. One shuttle passenger, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyal </PERSON>, said she went to <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> an hour and a half early today in anticipation of delays that did not occur. `` And to add insult to injury, I was in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for the weekend and I came back early to avoid the train strike,'' she said. That problem also did not materialize: A federal judge blocked a sympathy strike at the railroads. Today's first <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flights arriving in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the 6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m. airplanes from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were delayed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for reasons unrelated to the strike: It was snowing.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Challenge to Miami Affirmative Action Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today reinstated a challenge to a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> affirmative action plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned by women or minorities in building a rail transit system. The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ordered a lower court to reconsider its dismissal of the challenge in light of their Jan. 23 decision striking down a similar affirmative action `` set aside'' program in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> voted to leave intact the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> affirmative action plan. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan required that 30 percent of all public works contracts go to minority-owned businesses. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> plan was challenged by a construction company that submitted the lowest bid on the project but was rejected for lack of minority participation. The project involved construction of an electrified third rail for the city's transit system, which is run by Metropolitan <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials. The construction is financed with 80 percent federal funds. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> awarded the contract in 1979 to <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which submitted the second lowest bid of $ 8.37 million. The low bid, $ 8.08 million, was submitted by H.K. <ORGANIZATION> Porter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. County officials required that 5 percent of the work be farmed out to minority subcontractors unless the main contractor could show it made every reasonable effort but failed to get minority participation <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said it was unable to arrange minority participation. The corporation said it has a plant in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that would assemble the electrified third rail, and that only four items from outside sources would be needed to complete the project. The firm said no minority firms produced any of those items. After its bid was rejected, the company sued for $ 1.5 million in damages. The firm said the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> set-aside plan is a form of reverse discrimination that violates its constitutional rights. A federal judge threw out the <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> lawsuit, and the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld that ruling. The appeals court, citing key <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings on affirmative action, said the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> plan is justified by a federal law mandating minority participation in federally financed public works projects. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 passed the Surface Transportation Assistance Act appropriating money for highways and mass transit. The law, without setting specific percentages, called for participation of minority business enterprises to alleviate past discrimination against women, blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. The 11th Circuit court said <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> `` was not constitutionally required to make additional findings of past discrimination regarding the awarding of this contract. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about a national problem. Its findings provide adequate support for such local projects.'' The appeals court conceded it was troubled by a lack of evidence to support the 5 percent figure for the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> project. But the appeals court said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had upheld higher percentages for minority participation. The appeals court also noted that <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> failed to show it made every reasonable effort to get minority participation from subcontractors to support its bid. In urging the justices to reject <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s appeal, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials noted that the federal regulations at issue in the case acted on today were amended by a 1982 law. The new law changes the concept of minority-owned businesses to require 10 percent participation in federally supported projected of small businesses owned by `` socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.'' The case is <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> vs. Metropolitan <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 87-1001.

<HEAD>Court Enhances States' Power Over Gas Production in Kansas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today enhanced the power of states to regulate natural gas production, including `` use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production. The justices unanimously upheld the authority of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials to control production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas reservoir in the world. The decision upheld regulations adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. At issue was gas from the <LOCATION> Hugoton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which extends across portions of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. About two-thirds of the field is in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines. The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since 1944 imposed regulations aimed at assuring that each well will ultimately produce about the amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder. The idea was to treat well owners equally, since gas can migrate underground from an unproducing area to a well that is overproducing. To assure equal treatment, the state fixed the maximum amount of gas that can be produced each month from each well. In practice, wells can not always be operated to meet monthly ceilings for varying reasons. For example, there may be a low demand in a given month. To allow for these variables, state officials permitted owners of underproducing wells to `` save up'' their production ceilings _ creating what are called `` underages'' _ and overproduce in future months to make up for the shortfalls. To create a production incentive, the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> commission changed the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within specified periods of years or they would be canceled. The use-it-or-lose-it policy was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major buyers of the <ORGANIZATION> Hugoton </ORGANIZATION> gas for transport outside <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> said the 1983 rule change prevents it from purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually. The pipeline company asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to strike down the 1983 regulations on grounds that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has exclusive authority over natural gas production. Northwest Central also argued that the regulations impermissibly interfered with interstate commerce. Writing for the court today, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> regulations are neither pre-empted by federal law nor unconstitutional. `` We must decide whether a regulation ... to govern the timing of production of natural gas from the <LOCATION> Kansas-Hugoton </LOCATION> field violates either -LRB- the constitutional clause giving federal law supremacy over conflicting state laws -RRB- or the commerce clause,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` We hold that it does not.'' The justices ruled in 1986 that states may not require interstate pipelines to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool when the pipeline had pre-existing contracts with only some of the owners. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lawyers had told the high court that the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> controversy should not be controlled by the 1986 ruling. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION>, 86-1856.

<TEXT>
 An `` overlap of functions'' since <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> has contributed to a decision to lay off 550 of the company's 2,350 employees in its <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> headquarters, officials announced today. The layoffs, amounting to about 23.4 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> staff, are to take place over the next several weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said The company will be left with about 1,800 employees in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and 100,000 worldwide. `` The decision to eliminate these positions was necessary to make <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> a stronger, more profitable company, prepared to compete successfully in the world marketplace,'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and head of Grand Metropolitan's worldwide foods group, said in a statement. `` We have concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> business has been operating at a competitive disadvantage which must be corrected. Additionally, the merger of Grand Met and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> created some overlap of functions which will be eliminated,'' he said. After a three-month fight, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in December agreed to accept a sweetened $ 5.68 billion takeover offer from the Britain-based Grand Metropolitan. Grand Met reported sales of more than $ 11 billion in fiscal 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 6.2 billion.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>' birthday horoscope on Monday promised: `` You'll be on more solid emotional-financial ground in April.'' But Bakes, 43, did n't get the present he hoped for _ a return of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots to work. Without the pilots, who are supporting a strike by the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, the airline's chances of survival by April are considered low. Bakes, in pleading Sunday for the pilots to cross the Machinists picket lines, declined to speculate how long Eastern could survive but said `` the economics are clear.'' He also referred to speculation about consequences such as bankruptcy that could stem from a prolonged strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is $ 2.5 billion in debt and says it is losing $ 1 million a day. Since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> president 2 -LCB- years ago, Bakes has talked of plans to pull the carrier out of its 10-year financial tailspin, make it grow and make it profitable. But union leaders call Bakes one of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> crew,'' the executive team that helped <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> turn <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into a cheap-labor, predominantly non-union company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> bought Eastern three years ago. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and his `` union-buster'' image have galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers who believe his priorities are attacking organized labor and milking cash out of Eastern. `` What we're seeing here is a remake of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> movie,'' pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Sunday, after Bakes made a televised plea for pilots to cross <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union picket lines. `` You've got the same players and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as the script writer and director. But this time, the first act has been different.'' In 1983, pilots crossed <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> picket lines at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, but both unions later had their contracts voided when the parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> took <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization. <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said he was `` somewhat surprised'' and had miscalculated the extent to which <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots would support the Machinists. Eastern's strike contingency plans had counted upon the pilots to follow tradition and not support the Machinists, or for many of the pilots to defy their union leadership and cross the picket line. The tall, lean long-distance runner with bright, piercing blue eyes was born in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and graduated with honors from <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Bakes served as an assistant prosecutor in the Watergate investigation, was a counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittes and then the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and then, after the airline industry was deregulated, joined <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as a vice president. In 1982, <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> became executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and the carrier's president and chief operating officer in 1984. There, he helped <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> return from bankruptcy reorganization as a low-cost, aggressive airline. Bakes joined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as its chief executive in October 1986 and in January 1987 unveiled a plan to turn the airline around with a six-point program that included marketing expansions and $ 490 million in labor cost cuts. He has promised <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has shrunk steadily under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, will grow again if its labor costs can be cut. Bakes said he inherited a tense labor situation that predated <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, himself and chief Eastern negotiator <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is a company that's lost $ 1.5 billion since deregulation. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> ... owner of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has only been involved for three years. `` What we've tried to do is say: ` Give it a chance.' We will put contractual guarantees that perhaps will get over the initial distrust. `` With a successful company, when we're growing, buying airplanes, refurbishing, trust will come,'' Bakes said.

 On reviewing the monthly housing statistics, you might think that one of today's most popular participant activities is moving, preparing to move or thinking about moving. It is n't quite true. It is true nevertheless that real estate and housing markets have been particularly busy in recent months and years, in spite of foreboding by economists and despite rising prices and interest rates. January housing starts soared to 1.69 million units, 170,000 units higher than in December 1988 and 310,000 thousand higher than in December 1987. Single-family resales last year reached 3.63 million units, the highest since 1978. But, while such statistics are impressive and to some extent unexpected, there is an aspect of the housing market that is even more active. Remodeling, that is, seems to have become the national pastime. While final figures are n't in, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> already has declared that remodeling and fix-up expenditures last year exceeded $ 100 billion for the first time, double the amount spent five years earlier. While the exact amount for the year has n't been determined, it is known that in the first three quarters the annual rate was better than $ 102 billion and that preliminary indications were for a strong fourth quarter. The spending rise has been what economists tend to call `` dramatic.'' After varying between about $ 45 billion and $ 49 billion in the four years from 1980 through 1983, the total soared to $ 69.8 billion in 1984. It has risen without interruption since then, to $ 80.3 billion in 1985, $ 91.2 billion in 1986 and $ 94.1 billion in 1987. Even when adjusted for inflation, says <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> remodeler and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> NAHB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Remodelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, this huge increase `` makes the remodeling industry the fastest growing sector of the construction industry.'' Whether growth will continue is questionable, because almost all segments of housing markets are cyclical. The <ORGANIZATION> NAHB </ORGANIZATION> expects growth of four to six percent for the next three to five years, or little more than the inflation rate. Some non-housing people would n't be surprised, however, to see the trend continue, especially if the cost of new housing continues to rise. They point to these factors as contributing to the remodeling and repair statistics: _ The rising cost of housing, which often makes it more advantageous to remodel than move New houses often absorb all of the old equity; remodeling may leave some for other purposes. _ The desire to remain in mature communities with good schools and desirable amenities, rather than moving to new communities with prospects of higher taxes for new schools and municipal improvements _ Equity growth and growing access to that equity through tax-advantaged loans _ Convenience as well as savings Anyone who has moved recently knows it can be costly _ for moving expenses, set-up costs, lawyers, new mortgages and the points that accompany them. There may be inconvenience in either instance _ moving or remodeling. But in remodeling you can at least stay put amid the noise, confusion and dirt. According to an <ORGANIZATION> NAHB </ORGANIZATION> survey, the top remodeling activities in 1987 were room additions, which accounted for 25.5 percent of all remodeling, and kitchen remodeling, 20.2 percent. Complete rehabilitation accounted for 7.9 percent. As many homeowners might guess, the major expenditures by type of work were painting, plumbing and roofing, with heating and central air conditioning not far behind. Luxuries, such as swimming pools, were far down the list.

 The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations produced about 19.4 million barrels of oil a day in February, less than in the previous month but still above their new production goal, according to fresh estimates released Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in its Monthly Oil Market Report that estimated production by the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> dipped last month from 20.2 million barrels a day in January. The oil-producing nations agreed in November to slash output starting Jan. 1, to try to boost prices to $ 18 a barrel. Since then, analysts say the oil nations have reduced the crude flow to meet their ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year. The slowdown in output has boosted prices about $ 5 since last November. The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> was $ 16.31 a barrel last week. Independent oil-producing nations have also agreed to lower their exports in the April-June quarter in an effort to kick up prices further. As part of that drive, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Friday announced it would cut its exports by about 5 percent in the first half of the year. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the world's largest crude oil producer, said Monday the export reduction would amount to 100,000 barrels a day and was an effort to cooperate closely with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to stabilize world oil prices. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sells foreign clients an estimated 1.8 million barrels of oil a day. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s report estimated the world oil supply at 49.6 million barrels a day in February, off 900,000 barrels from January. `` The reduction,'' it said, `` is due primarily to lower production in several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries as well as a slight production decline in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> is an organization of about two-dozen industrialized nations. Oil output in those nations, it said, was estimated at 16.2 million barrels a day in February, down 100,000 barrels from January. The report also said strong economic growth, especially in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, helped lift oil consumption in the industrialized nations to 38.8 million barrels a day in the October-December quarter of 1988, up about 5 percent from year-earlier levels. `` Heavy fuel oil consumption increased in all regions, mainly because of higher demand by electric utilities,'' the report said. `` In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, there was considerable switching from natural gas, partly because of competitively priced fuel oil.'' Oil consumption in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, it said, was 19.7 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of last year, a gain of about 4.5 percent from the same period of 1987. European consumption, it said, advanced about 3.5 percent in the last three months of 1988. The report estimated that oil consumption in the industrialized nations would rise about 1.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. `` January consumption growth was quite strong but appeared to slow in February,'' it said. According to the agency's supply estimates, only <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> appeared to be producing in February above the levels set for individual <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries last November. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s output was estimated at 2.7 million barrels a day in February, compared with its quota of 2.6 million barrels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> produced about 1.6 million barrels a day, well above its target of 988,000 barrels. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> was measured at roughly 300,000 barrels a day, compared with its quota of 230,000 barrels. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest crude exporter, produced an estimated 4.5 million barrels a day in February, the same as its quota. Its daily output was roughly 4.8 million barrels in January. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> released figures late last month that showed member countries complying in January with the new output accord. It said a dozen of its members supplied a total of 17.42 million barrels a day in January, just under the combined quota for those countries of 17.51 million barrels. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> said it measures a nation's quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are: <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 Since coming to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as president 2 -LCB- years ago, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> has insisted he has firm plans to pull the carrier out of its 10-year financial tailspin. The crippling strike that continued in its third day today indicates his employees do n't really believe him. Instead, union leaders call Bakes one of `` the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> crew,'' the executive team that helped <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> turn <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into a cheap-labor, predominantly nonunion company It's <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and his `` union-buster'' image that has galvanized <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s workers, who believe his priorites are attacking organized labor and milking cash out of Eastern. `` By all the actions they've already taken, it's clear where he's taking the airline,'' pilots' union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Sunday, after Bakes made a nationally televised plea for pilots to cross <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union picket lines and return to work `` He -LRB- Bakes -RRB- is trying to deflect the issue away from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` What we're seeing here is a remake of the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> movie. You've got the same players and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as the script writer and director,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` But this time, the first act has been different.'' Cole referred to 1983 when pilots crossed <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> picket lines at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, only to join the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> in having their contracts voided when the parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> took the carrier into bankruptcy reorganization. Bakes admitted Sunday he was `` somewhat surprised'' and had miscalculated the extent to which pilots would support the Machinists. Eastern's contingency plans had counted on pilots crossing the picket lines. `` If the pilots had come to work Friday night, I'd be at the Miami Grand Prix this afternoon and you'd all be home with your families,'' Bakes told reporters. This morning, Bakes accused the pilots of misleading the airline, and later in the day, the airline dropped the other shoe by filing suit against the pilots, saying the work stoppage was illegal. `` The pilots have been saying over the last year that if the Machinists did strike, they would come to work. That's why we were so surprised,'' Bakes said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` This is the pilots strike that really should n't have been,'' added Bakes. Eastern filed the request for a restraining order to halt the strike with a federal judge in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who did not immediately schedule a hearing. The tall, lean long-distance runner with bright, piercing blue eyes turned 43 today. A newspaper horoscope for those with birthdays today promises: `` You'll be on more solid emotional-financial ground in April.'' However, Bakes is unlikely to reach that ground with Eastern if the strike does n't end soon. He declined to speculate on how long Eastern could stay alive, but said `` the economics are clear.'' He referred to speculation about the consequences of a prolonged strike, which include bankruptcy. Bakes said Sunday the company is keeping up its payments on nearly $ 2.5 billion in debts. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, native, graduated with honors from <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, served as an assistant prosecutor in the Watergate investigation, was a counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees and then the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. After the airline industry was deregulated, he joined <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> as a vice president. In 1982, he became executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and the carrier's president and chief operating officer in 1984. There, he helped <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> return from bankruptcy reorganization with a low-cost, aggressive airline. Bakes joined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as its chief executive in October 1986. Three months later, he unveiled a plan to turn the airline around with a program that included marketing expansions and cutting labor costs overall by $ 490 million, or about 30 percent. He has promised <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has shrunk steadily under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, will be rebuilt to grow if its labor costs can be cut. Bakes agreed that trust is an issue. `` We would hope that over time there will be much more trust among all the Eastern people,'' he said, adding that he inherited a tense labor situation that predated `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> and -LRB- chief negotiator -RRB- <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is a company that's lost $ 1.5 billion since deregulation. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> ... owner of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has only been involved for three years. `` What we've tried to do is say: ` Give it a chance.' We will put contractual guarantees that perhaps will get over the initial distrust. `` With a successful company, when we're growing, buying airplanes, refurbishing, trust will come,'' Bakes said.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Say Economy Grew in February But At Slower Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy grew in February at the slowest rate in two years, according to a survey of purchasing executives. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks the economy through its monthly survey of its members, said in a report for release Monday that its Purchasing Managers Index fell slightly last month, to 53.0 from 53.2. The February level was the lowest for the index since February 1987, when it was 52.6 percent. Despite the drop, the index still pointed to economic growth. A reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding, while below 50 it is contracting. The index has exceeded 50 for 31 consecutive months. `` The economy appears to have entered a period of slower and more moderate growth than the robust pace of last year,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, association chairman and director of materials management at <ORGANIZATION> Pitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bowes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This, coupled with a decreased employment and a declining inflation trend, could be signalling a more subdued and healthier economy for this stage of the economic recovery.'' The survey found that new orders continued to increase in February from the previous month, which was at its lowest level since October 1986. Thirty-two percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said new orders were better last month, while 53 percent said they were the same and 15 percent said they were worse. In January, 27 percent said they were better, while 61 percent said they were the same and 12 percent said they were worse. The rate of production growth slowed to an index level of 53.7 percent from 56.2 percent in January. The February level was its lowest since 53.0 percent in December 1986. Vendor deliveries continued to grow, but their change came at a slower pace. Slow vendor deliveries are a bullish economic signal; they indicate a business is getting new orders faster than it can fill them. Sixteen percent of the respondents said deliveries were slower, while 74 percent said they were the same and 10 percent said they were faster. In January, 15 percent reported slower deliveries, while 79 percent said they were the same and 6 percent said they were faster. Inventories declined for the second consecutive month. Eighteen percent of the purchasing managers said inventories were higher, 67 percent said they were the same and 15 percent said they were lower. That compared with 17 percent who said they were higher, 59 percent who said they lower in January. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents said prices were higher, while 57 percent said they were the same and 5 percent said they were lower. In January, 51 percent reported higher prices, while 46 percent said they were the same and 3 percent said they lower. Employment declined in February after eight consecutive months of increasing, according to the survey. Thirteen percent of the purchasing managers said employment was up at their companies, 72 percent said it was the same and 15 percent said it was down. The previous month, 10 percent reported higher employment, 80 percent said it was the same and 10 percent said it fell. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> is an education and research organization of purchasing executives. It polls purchasing managers in more than 250 industrial firms for its economic survey.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics trade deficit with the world shrank about 25 percent in 1988 to $ 9.6 billion but the deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> grew 2 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports increased more than 28 percent to $ 58 billion from $ 45.2 billion in 1987, while imports increased 17 percent to $ 67.6 billion from $ 58 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics companies' exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> shot up, but a small percentage increase in imports was still enough to cause the deficit to swell. The electronics trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> grew to $ 20.5 billion from $ 20.1 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> grew more than 43 percent, to $ 6.3 billion in 1988 from $ 4.4 billion in 1987. Imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased 9.4 percent to $ 26.8 billion. `` This significant reduction in our trade deficit with the world is the result of a surge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics exports,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AEA </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer. `` Unfortunately, the same progress was n't achieved with our trade problems with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` The Japanese electronics industry must realize that trade is a two-way street and that the open markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be matched by the same in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The fourth-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics trade deficit with the world decreased by almost 20 percent to $ 3.0 billion from $ 3.7 billion in 1987. Exports rose to $ 15.7 billion from $ 12.7 billion and imports to $ 18.6 billion from $ 16.4 billion. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for electronics products and services slowed its rate of growth in the 1988 fourth quarter to 1.5 percent to $ 5.6 billion from $ 5.5 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> improved to $ 1.8 billion in the 1988 quarter from $ 1.3 billion in 1987 and imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose to $ 7.4 billion from $ 6.9 billion.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly higher Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with the wheat market posting solid gains amid weather concerns and new export activity. The key winter-wheat states of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> received far less precipitation over the weekend than many traders had expected, spurring brisk buying Monday of new-crop wheat futures _ contracts for delivery in July or later. Wheat for near-term delivery was supported by reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was seeking to buy 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices for April or May delivery. The soybean complex was boosted by heavy speculative buying of soybean meal futures, although analysts could cite no new supply-and-demand developments to account for the late surge. Corn futures finished narrowly mixed. At the close, wheat was 2 \ cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.80 a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.10 a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 7.71 a

 Colored plastic wrap introduced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will `` make the mundane task of wrapping leftovers fun,'' the company says. Skeptical? <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> says consumers responded with even more enthusiasm than expected when the company tried out the red, green, blue and yellow plastic wrap in focus groups and simulated test markets. `` The addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic wrap, which in its clear form is considered purely a functional product,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nims </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>' consumer products division. `` Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting.'' The new product, called `` Crystal Color Plastic Wrap,'' is intended to liven up the kitchen... make things more interesting,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waring </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, author of `` The Total Woman'' and proponent of the idea that women spice up their marriages by greeting their husbands at the door wearing only plastic wrap, says the colored wrap `` is a great idea. It would really add a lot of zip,'' she said Sunday in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The Richmond-based company will promote use of the colored wrap in crafts as well as food storage, Ms. <PERSON> Waring </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> will have several special promotions around the holidays for the product, which is manufactured at its plant in Grottoes, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The colored wrap is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company's sales, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> analysts said. `` It's a tempest in a teapot,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siedenburg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Reynolds is principally and always will be an aluminum producer. `` Does it matter what color you use to wrap the meat you did n't finish at dinner? he added.

<HEAD>Ruling Bolsters States' Power To Regulate Natural Gas Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The Supreme Court Monday enhanced the power of states to regulate natural gas production, including `` use-it-or-lose-it'' rules designed to stimulate production. The justices unanimously upheld the authority of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> officials to control production from what is believed to be the largest natural gas reservoir in the world. The decision upheld regulations adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. At issue was gas from the <LOCATION> Hugoton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, which extends across portions of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. About two-thirds of the field is in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, containing some 4,000 wells as of 1983. Most of the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines. The use-it-or-lose-it policy was challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the major buyers of the <ORGANIZATION> Hugoton </ORGANIZATION> gas for transport outside <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> said the 1983 rule change prevents it from purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually. The pipeline company asked the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to strike down the 1983 regulations on grounds that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has exclusive authority over natural gas production. Northwest Central also argued that the regulations impermissibly interfered with interstate commerce. Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> regulations are neither pre-empted by federal law nor unconstitutional. In other action, the court: _ Rejected an appeal by Northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other states _ Decided federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair treatment The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. _ In a case stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, refused to let <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over age 60 The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is bound by an age-bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against Western. _ Turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securities law The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could force <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> to tell readers whether companies featured in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for other services. _ Took steps against two affirmative action programs, citing its ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in the award of public works contracts in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system. And the court declared unconstitutional a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> law requiring that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minority-owned businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women.

 Stock prices posted a broad gain today in activity dominated by buying of communications and entertainment issues. The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might be candidates for mergers or takeovers. Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of economic growth. That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest rates.

 Contracts for new construction fell 5 percent in January from the high level of December, when public works projects had surged, F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. F.W. Dodge, a division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said fluctuations in contracting for public works projects have been a big influence on the building sector for several months. Commercial and industrial construction showed renewed strength in January while residential building slowed. Contracting for public works and utilities in January was 20 percent lower than December's unusually strong level. The January decline brought the annual pace of contracting in this sector to a more normal level, F.W. <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> said. The value of all newly started construction in January declined to an annual rate of $ 243.6 billion from December's annual rate of $ 256.2 billion. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>'s vice president and chief economist, said the construction sector entered 1989 on a weak note and could deteriorate as the year goes on if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> becomes increasingly aggressive in its battle against inflation. The building business is very sensitive to interest rate movements and interest charges have been rising lately as the central bank pursues a tight-money policy. `` One month hardly sets a trend, but if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> stands firm in its determination to tighten credit further as inflationary pressures continue to mount, the coming months could make January look good,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said.

 To <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, commercial television is as welcome in the classroom as it is in the living room. `` The people against the commercials should wake up and smell the coffee,'' the 12th-grader at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mumford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said Monday after viewing the first edition of <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>' Channel One news program `` This is the 1980s and commercials are a way of life. `` They're just trying to create the image of ` Leave It To Beaver' and it's just not that way anymore,'' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said of the show's Students and administrators at <LOCATION> Mumford </LOCATION> gave high marks to Channel One, a 12-minute daily program being tested in six schools around the country by <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, - based media company The launch of Channel One came amid growing criticism by some children's advocates and educators, including the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of the inclusion of 30-second television ads. Commercials for Snickers candy bars, Head and Shoulders shampoo, <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s 501 jeans and the Partnership for a Drug-Free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> were in the initial show. `` I enjoyed the program,'' said <PERSON> LaMesa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a 12th-grader. `` Not a lot of kids go home and watch the news on television, so it's good that they have the opportunity to see it at school.'' About 20 students viewed the premier show with members of the media in the high school's library on Monday. The program contained features on students' reactions to the continuing death threats against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of the book `` The Satanic Verses;'' life for a teen-ager in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>; and the controversy involving the launch of Channel One. `` The story about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was especially interesting because I got to see how teen-agers over there live, what they wear, what music they listen to,'' 12th-grader <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. Students appeared to watch the program closely, with some taking notes, while others at times were distracted by the lights of television cameras from local stations covering the program's first showing. Detroit Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, on hand for the debut of Channel One, said the program would be monitored carefully. `` We take very seriously the responsibility of educating young people,'' <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> said. `` We have to be very careful about the intrusion of commercialism upon a captive audience.''

 Energy futures prices began the week slightly higher Monday, aided by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reaffirmation of oil production cuts and a report showing a drop in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> output last month. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the April contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 11 cents higher at $ 18.67 a barrel, after falling 16 cents in volatile trading Friday. The April contract had risen as high as $ 18.86 a barrel Monday, but declined on profit-taking, analysts said. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 0.63 cent higher at 51.43 cents a gallon, after falling 1.07 cents Friday. April unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.68 cent the previous session, settled at 51.59 cents, up 0.60 cent. `` The confirmation of the Soviet cutback on production was the principal issue in the market,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Top Soviet energy officials said Monday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to cooperate closely with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to stabilize world oil markets The statements follow a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announcement Friday that the Soviets will cut oil exports by about 5 percent in the first six months of 1989, as part of an effort by non-OPEC producers to shore up world oil prices. <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said the oil market also got a boost Monday by a report shoing daily oil production among the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> declined to 19.4 million from 20.2 million barrels. The 13-nation cartel agreed in November to slash output starting Jan. 1, to try to boost prices to $ 18 a barrel. Since then, analysts say, the oil nations have cut crude flow to meet their daily quota of 18.5 million in the first six months of the year.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is about to follow up last month's order for up to $ 7.5 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> jets with the purchase of up to $ 3.5 billion more in smaller commuter airplanes from undisclosed manufacturers, a newspaper reported Monday. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman, though, said the company has yet to make any decisions about commuter plane purchases. The small commuter jets, which would seat about 100 and together cost up to $ 2 billion, would fly under the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> name, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported. Turboprop planes that seat between 35 and 50 passengers and together cost up to $ 1.5 billion would be flown by American's commuter airline subsidiaries that operate collectively as <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>, the newspaper said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s senior vice president for operations, told the newspaper the airline expects to order both types of aircraft within the next 30 to 45 days. `` We'd like them yesterday,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We are units short. We'd love to have 50 more airplanes Monday morning, simply because we have the chance to use them productively now. And there are some closing windows of opportunity.'' The story did not say what company might supply the new planes. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was attending a daylong meeting Monday and was unavailable for comment, his secretary told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Calls to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were referred to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, a corporate communications spokesman for American. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said reports about plans for airplane purchases are `` speculative'' and said although <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is reviewing its needs for new commuter airplanes, decisions about purchases have yet to be made. With 475 airplanes, American already operates the biggest commercial fleet in the Western world. Last month, American ordered eight MD-11s with the option to buy another 42. MD-11s are three-engine, wide-body jets that can carry 405 passengers long-range and are designed to replace the older DC-10. American also took options on 100 MD-80s, smaller twin-jet planes designed to replace the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. American's commuter airline subsidiaries operate 128 commuter planes, and six are on order. That does not include the 58 planes operated by <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Grapevine </LOCATION>, an independent company that flies as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> franchisee at American's <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> hub, and Executive Air, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> operator at American's hub at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wants to use some 100-seat jets to replace its 39 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100s, which seat 118 and are the oldest planes in the fleet. The oldest 727-100 is nearly 25 years old. American also sees the 100-seat jet as a vehicle for expansion into small-city markets. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> has identified 80 to 100 such markets around the country.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman lashed out at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday just moments after a top official of the Seattle-based aerospace firm testified there was no evidence to link the use of a high-tech composite material with workers' health problems. `` I am somewhat resentful of your testimony,'' said <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, chairman of the toxic substances, environmental oversight, research and development subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said he felt <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was `` minimizing'' the effects the materials can have on workers by pleading ignorance and emphasizing the disagreements in the medical community. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for human resources, told the subcommittee his company had decided to discontinue use of the material even though it was `` determined that the material presented no significant health hazard.'' <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON> also said doctors were divided on the effects composite materials can have on workers and that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had `` not only met, but significantly exceeded'' regulatory standards governing use of the material. <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, in ending its use of a resin that contains phenol and formaldehyde, was responding to workers' complaints `` The fact that we believed the material was safe became irrelevant,'' said <PERSON> Peritore </PERSON>. `` In the highly-charged atmosphere that existed, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concerns was to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> told reporters after the hearing, that he felt testimony from an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> showed that firm `` recognized the problem'' and was trying to do something about it. `` The difference between <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was like night and day,'' said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>. The subcommittee hearing stemmed from complaints by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area and employees at a production site for the new stealth fighter operated by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The materials are mixtures of plastic, carbon and synthetic fibers which increasingly are being used to replace metal in aircaft. Nearly 100 workers are suing <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, claiming workplace chemicals resulted in ailments ranging from dizziness, nausea and bloody urine to skin and organ injuries and cancer. Lawyers representing the workers say at least five have died of cancer since the lawsuit was filed in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers at plants in the Puget Sound region, including Kent, <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>, have had similar health complaints. Dr. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, allergist whose patients include more than 130 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees, said composite materials are causing `` widespread, serious'' health problems for aerospace workers. `` Chemicals are being used without adequate health and safety data, without proper testing, and without giving some workers the necessary protective equipment, ventiliation and training that are essential to safely using these toxic industrial materials,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said his patients showed a `` definite pattern of symptoms'' that were `` unprecedented and unexpected'' in a general allergy practice. `` There are widespread, serious health problems throughout the industry now that they are using the new composite materials,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees he has seen, 75 percent suffer from extreme fatigue, 68 percent had memory lapses, 67 had chest pains or trouble breathing and 68 percent had vision problems. In addition, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there was evidence that some of the employees may be suffering from `` organic brain poisoning,'' which can result in varying degrees of `` incapacity to perform and think up to previous abilities. `` It is of the greatest urgency that adequate safety is insured in the workplace wherever these materials are used,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The unfortunate victims of these chemical poisons should be properly cared for and not be subjected to harrassment, demotion, termination, or forced to continue working in unhealthy work environments until they can work no more.'' Two women who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> plant testified they were never warned that the chemicals could be dangerous. `` I had no idea what chemicals we had in the shop,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> of North Bend, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> said the exposure to chemicals left her with a number of medical problems and an overall lack of energy `` I ca n't play with my own granddaughter for more than a few minutes,'' she said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said workers were discouraged from reporting their health problems and were warned they would be fired if they did. `` I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Schrum </PERSON>. `` I ca n't go to the grocery store without getting sick, I ca n't sleep at night, you do n't eat, you have no energy. `` My memory is a mess, I do n't know my kids, some days I do n't even know I am in my home,'' she said

<HEAD>Du Pont Announces Long-Term Alternatives To CFC Cleaning Agent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it has developed two products that could become long-term replacements for a chemical commonly used as a cleaning agent that is suspected of damaging the Earth's ozone layer The products are intended as substitutes for CFC-113, a chlorofluorocarbon used by the electronics and other industries requiring high standards of cleanliness in such equipment as wiring assemblies. Cleaning agents account for about 20 percent of the world market for CFCs, which also are used in refrigeration, aerosols, and blowing agents, including for insulation and cushioning. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, which accounts for about half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of CFCs and is the world's largest producer, plans to stop making the chemicals, and has been researching possible alternative products. With the latest two products, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> has developed candidates to replace CFCs in each of the four major areas in which the chemicals are used, said <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunham </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> group vice president. He made the announcement Sunday at an international conference on ozone protection in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and a summary of his remarks was released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 120-nation conference has focused attention on the chemical compounds that scientists say are destroying the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. The compounds are blamed for creating an ozone hole roughly the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> every winter. A smaller hole has also been spotted over the Arctic. One of <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s long-term cleaning agent substitutes is a fluorocarbon-based blend that has about 90 percent less ozone depletion potential. Laboratory tests show it might be a superior cleaning agent in removing residue from wiring assemblies in the electronics industry. The other candidate contains a mixture of solvents and surface-active agents and it is designed to remove residue in a process using a final water rinse. It has no potential to deplete the ozone layer. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has applied for patents on both blends and limited quantities of each are available for evaluation. The company said that depending on market reaction and further testing, the fluorocarbon-based product could be ready for commercial use in several years and the other product could be ready by the end of this year. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> plans to introduce a series of product alternatives to CFCs over a three-year to five-year period beginning in 1990. The company expects to phase CFCs out of several major market segments in the early to mid-1990s, but complete phaseout may take until the turn of the century. The company said it has spent or authorized nearly $ 100 million on developing substitutes for CFCs and plans to spend $ 45 million more this year. An investment of more than $ 1 billion would be needed to completely restructure its <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> business to produce alternative products, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said.

 The dollar rose against most major currencies except the British pound and Canadian dollar in choppy trading Monday. Gold prices rose in domestic trading following a mixed performance overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 387.30 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, $ 1 higher than Friday's late bid. <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar benefited from improvements in the stock and bond markets and rising oil prices. Snowy weather in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Monday kept some dealers away and persuaded others to end their business days early, which made for a thin market, <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON> said. In a thin market, individual trades can have an exaggerated impact on prices. European dealers said the market lacked much incentive to do anything other than explore the dollar's recent ranges.

 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees showed little sympathy Monday for the walkout at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, saying many of them earn less money than the strikers at the troubled sister carrier. Pilots for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, itself the target of wage cuts and job actions during a tumultuous 1983 reorganization under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, predict their Eastern counterparts will suffer for honoring picket lines <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> owns both airlines. `` My personal opinion is that the pilots _ or for that matter anyone else _ should not have gone out on strike. I think they're going to lose their jobs and they're probably going to lose the airline,'' said one pilot, who spoke on the condition of anonymity `` I think <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s going to shut that thing -LRB- Eastern -RRB- down and either sell parts of it or bankrupt it,'' he said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots he talked to in advance of the strike had hoped to keep flying. `` I do n't see how they can continue.'' Of more than a dozen <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> employees interviewed, none expressed misgivings about aiding <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management by accepting additional passengers bumped from the sister carrier's flights. However, some <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> laborers suggested their comments were restricted by management. `` It's going to be tough to try to find anyone to talk to,'' said one worker. `` They're really cracking down on us.'' With only four daily <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flights through <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> airports, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> workers say they have seen only a slight rise in passengers and shipping since the strike began. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and Eastern is in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Despite increased security and fears that striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers may target <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> because of its relationship to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, there have been no reported attempts to block <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> operations, union and airline officials said Many of the pilots, flight attendants and other workers at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s Intercontinental Airport, the airline's main hub, said they considered the labor strife unrelated to their operations, and uncalled for when compared with salaries at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or in other industries. Nearly all of them, however, said they hoped to see an end to the strike and the ultimate survival of Eastern. `` What <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> did is look at their salaries and then compare them to salaries in the marketplace _ what those people would make working somewhere else,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> pilot, who asked not to be named. `` Let's face it _ throwing a bag is throwing a bag no matter where you do it,'' he said. `` This is a supply and demand business and they're in business to make a profit. They have to answer to their shareholders.'' The sentiments apparently spread through the ranks at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, although many employees refused to be interviewed. `` The problem is n't really the mechanics, it's the baggage handlers,'' said one worker. `` They outnumber the mechanics and they're the ones who pushed this thing, and they're making a lot of money for what they're doing.'' He said that his wife, a nurse, makes about $ 6 per hour less than an Eastern baggage attendant who may have no advanced education. <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was laid off after <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection in 1983 but later was rehired and rose to a supervisory position, said union members at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> apparently missed a valuable history lesson. `` I think they should have foreseen what was taking place and know what he -LRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> -RRB- would do _ get rid of their jobs,'' she said of the possible response to the strike.

<HEAD>Japan Not Obliged to Buy More U.S. Chips, Trade Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not obliged to increase American semiconductor manufacturers' share of this country's computer chip market, a Japanese trade ministry official said Monday, disputing <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. `` There is no legally binding agreement except the semiconductor agreement,'' an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials have said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has failed to live up to a commitment to increase the percentage of the Japanese chip market held by American companies, while Japanese officials say they made no such commitment. Former <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> alleged last year in his book, `` Trading Places: How <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allowed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to Take the Lead,'' that the Japanese government pledged in a secret document to raise the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share of semiconductors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to 20 percent by 1991. In the third quarter of last year, the latest period for which there are statistics, foreign manufacturers had 10.9 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chip market, the <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> official said in an interview. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the American share rose from 9.2 percent in 1987 to 9.5 percent in 1988. In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pledged not to dump computer chips _ selling them at less than fair market value _ in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and to increase American access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chip market. <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> wrote that there was a confidenial side letter in which `` the Japanese said that they understood, welcomed and would make efforts to assist the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in reaching their goal of a 20 percent market share within five years. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators said that this commitment meant there would be a guaranteed increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the Japanese market,'' <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> added. Japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separate document accompanying the semiconductor agreement, but say there was no document that holds them to increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share. `` In a sense he -LRB- <PERSON> Prestowitz </PERSON> -RRB- is wrong because there are no legally binding documents. In fact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government statements never admitted to the existence of such a document,'' the <ORGANIZATION> MITI </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` In general there are a lot of letters of exchange between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in any kind of trade negotiations,'' he said. `` Sometimes they're secret and sometimes they're not.'' Asked if there was an informal agreement by the Japanese government on a 20 percent share for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chip manufacturers, the official said, `` No comment.'' But he added, `` Imagine if there was such a letter. It would n't represent a commitment to a market share. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official who spoke on condition of anonymity repeated Monday the American position that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is failing to live up to an agreement to ensure a steady increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In April 1987, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed penalty tariffs of $ 300 million against Japanese electronics imports, saying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still was dumping chips worldwide and had failed to live up to its market access pledge. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reduced the penalties to $ 165 million two months later, saying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had stopped dumping but that the access question remained. Japanese manufacturers accounted for 50 percent of semiconductors sold in the world last year, up from 48 percent in 1987, while the American global share fell from 39 percent to 37 percent, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> survey.

<HEAD>Platinum Rallies On Japanese Buying, Technical Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum futures prices gained strongly Monday after a modest rally led by Japanese jewelry makers pushed prices through key resistance levels, triggering widespread buying. On other markets, gold and silver futures also advanced; copper futures declined; energy futures gained; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Platinum settled $ 7.40 to $ 8.30 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in April at $ 546.70 a troy ounce. Japanese commercial traders, who recently had been absent from the platinum market, began buying futures early in the session, which encouraged others to enter the market. The rally slowly gathered steam, then accelerated rapidly in afternoon trading after the April contract's price surpassed $ 544 a troy ounce, analysts said. `` We hit buy stops right over that, ran up to $ 548, then pulled back,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, a metals-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Observers noted an easing of concern about the possibility that a strike in the base-metals section of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rustenburg </LOCATION> metals complex would spread to the platinum refinery, which processes about half of the world's platinum. `` That's definitely a contributing factor but it's not as prominent as it was last week,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Trading volume in precious metals futures was thin, both on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, where gold and silver futures are traded. Gold settled $ 1.10 to $ 1.20 higher with April at $ 390.50 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 0.8 cent higher with March at $ 5.809 a troy ounce. Copper futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after five straight days of gains. The decline was linked to the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s report of a relatively large, 4,500-ton increase last week in its warehouse stocks of copper, and to a 337-ton increase over the weekend in warehouse stocks registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Copper settled 1.4 cents to 3.1 cents lower with May at $ 1.42 a pound. Oil futures climbed moderately higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report showing a reduction in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> crude-oil output last month. Meanwhile, Soviet energy officials said Monday they were willing to extend a previously announced 5 percent cutback in crude-oil production beyond the original 6-month deadline in a bid to help boost prices. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 21 cents higher with April at $ 18.67 a barrel; heating oil was .32 cent to .63 cent higher with April at 51.43 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .06 cent to .87 cent higher with April at 51.59 cents a gallon. Wheat futures made solid gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following a weekend of drier-than-expected weather in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the heart of the winter-wheat country. Wheat also was supported by reports that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was seeking to buy 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. Wheat settled 2 \ cents to 7 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.35 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.79 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 4 \ cents higher with March at $ 2.09 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -RCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 7.70 -LCB- a Livestock futures settled mixed in lackluster trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Frozen pork bellies finished sharply higher, erasing about half the losses sustained in last Friday's steep sell-off Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with April at 77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .43 cent lower with March at 82.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to .52 cent higher with April at 43.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.85 cent lower to 1.38 cent higher with March at 38.95 cents a pound.

A round-trip ticket on the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concorde </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> cost $ 4,876, up 10.2 percent from $ 4,424 in 1987. A <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> Corniche convertible cost $ 205,500, up 12 percent from $ 183,500; the caviar cost $ 47, up from $ 33.25; a bottle of <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> X.O. cognac cost $ 78.95, up 7 percent from $ 73.79, while a bottle of <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perignon </PERSON> cost $ 69.97, up 8.5 percent from $ 64.50; and a men's Rolex Oyster perpetual day-date watch with President bracelet could be had for $ 11,700, 12 percent more than last year's $ 10,450 Some items registered price increases that were near or lower than the overall CPI increase: a ticket to `` Cats,'' $ 50, up 5.3 percent from last year's $ 47.50; a wash, cut and blow dry in one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s more exclusive salons cost $ 70, up 4.5 percent from $ 67; and a full-length mink, $ 17,000, up $ 500 or 3 percent from last year's $ 16,500.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, acquired by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.68 billion two months ago, announced plans Monday to lay off 550 of the company's 2,350 employees in its <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> headquarters. An `` overlap of functions'' since the food and restaurant company was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION> was cited as a reason for the across-the-board layoffs, and one analyst expressed surprise about the amount of fat on the Doughboy. `` These guys -LRB- Grand Met -RRB- are obviously looking to become low-cost producers,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The layoffs over the next several weeks will leave <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> with about 1,800 employees in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and 100,000 worldwide. `` The decision to eliminate these positions was necessary to make <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> a stronger, more profitable company, prepared to compete successfully in the world marketplace,'' <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and head of Grand Metropolitan's worldwide foods group, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said the layoffs affect all job classifications, from clerical support employees to managerial and staff-level functions. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> announced the closing of two plants, in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, which will result in 334 layoffs. The shutdowns, effective the end of March, are because of surplus production capacity resulting from acquisitions and were in the works before the takeover. After a three-month fight, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> in December agreed to accept a sweetened $ 5.68 billion takeover offer from Grand Metropolitan. The acquisition was completed in January. Grand Met is a British real estate, liquor and gambling conglomerate. Its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings include <PERSON> Alpo </PERSON> dog food and Pearle Vision Centers. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> makes <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> flour, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetables, <PERSON> Haagen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dazs </PERSON> ice cream and a variety of other products. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also owns the Burger King, <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale restaurant chains.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said Monday he might be willing to accept a gasoline tax increase of 5 cents a gallon if the money was used to repair aging roads and bridges `` There's a lot of money needed for infrastructure,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highway system needs a great deal of work done on it.'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> spoke at a news conference preceding an Economic Club of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> luncheon. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said he disagreed with proposals that would use the increased tax receipts for uses other than roads and bridges. `` A large increase in the fuel tax is not an easy option for fiscal relief,'' he said later in his formal address. On another matter, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> expects stable crude oil prices in the coming year with no marked increases for more than two years. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> predicted that the price of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brent </LOCATION> crude oil will average $ 15 to $ 17 a barrel this year, with <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude about $ 1 a barrel more.

The Exxon chief executive officer said he would n't dispute predictions of $ 25 - to $ 30-a-barrel prices by 2000 But he said, `` I would n't bet a nickel on it either.'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said he did n't know how long the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' December agreement to limit the countries' total production to 18.5 million barrels a day would last Such agreements `` all hold up for a while,'' he said. He refused to forecast <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the year, but said they would depend heavily on crude oil prices.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday asked its shareholders to adopt a charter amendment requiring 80 percent shareholder approval for any merger or sale that might threaten its newspapers' journalistic goals The `` super-majority'' would also apply to any merger putting more than 20 percent of the company under foreign ownership. `` Our board believes the company's newspapers serve a unique and vital public interest in our society,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>. `` The proposed charter amendment is directed at preserving their journalistic excellence, integrity and independence ...'' He said the company's newspapers have won 50 Pulitzer prizes, including 22 in the past four years. The proposal is to be voted on at <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s April 28 annual meeting. <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said he was not aware of any threatened or rumored takeover effort against <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 30 newspapers. He noted that more than half of the company's shares are in the hands of the current directors, officers, employees and members of the founding families. The `` super-majority,'' as management called it, would be avoided only if the board studied the merger or buyout plan, and determined it did not threaten the company's journalistic mission, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said. The company wants to extend the rule to cases involving foreign ownership, noting that `` restriction on foreign ownership of our country's media are not uncommon.'' The proxy statement says that federal law already prohibits foreign ownership of more than 20 percent of the stock of any licensee of any broadcast station.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that a federal judge has dismissed all claims made by <ORGANIZATION> SAPC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> and its founder, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapor </PERSON>. In November, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> dismissed <ORGANIZATION> SAPC </ORGANIZATION>'s claim of copyright infringement, ruling that <ORGANIZATION> SAPC </ORGANIZATION> gave up its right to sue when it sold most of its assets to <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Keeton </PERSON> dismissed all remaining charges against <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kapor </PERSON> last Wednesday. Those claims included charges of breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential secrets and unjust enrichment. <ORGANIZATION> SAPC </ORGANIZATION>'s motion for an immediate appeal was denied. A hearing has been scheduled for March 29 to consider whether to proceed with <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> counterclaims seeking full compensation for expenses related to the suit. <ORGANIZATION> SAPC </ORGANIZATION>'s telephone number at its <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> headquarters was disconnected. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said SAPC was still incorporated but was not doing business.

<HEAD>A Look At Developments in the Eastern Airlines Strike</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern Bjt</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Here are some developments in the 3-day-old <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OPERATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Eastern shut down nearly all operations and laid off 5,000 workers, saying it could not maintain its business while pilots honored the Machinists' walkout. The airline said it would retain its most profitable routes _ the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle and three flights weekly between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Using managers and workers who crossed picket lines, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> managed to fly about one-third of its 62 shuttle flights between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Snow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hampered service further. Supervisors de-iced planes, loaded baggage and worked as flight attendants. Planes that did leave were delayed by up to five hours. Few non-shuttle flights made it into the air.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Eastern filed a motion in federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> against the pilots. The airline said the pilots' walkout was illegal and asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to force them back to work. The pilots, who argue they are not striking but merely honoring Machinists' picket lines, said they were studying the management motion and were not surprised by it. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> blamed the pilots for the shutdown. `` The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the company,'' he said. The 41,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reiterated a pledge to begin a job action at dawn Tuesday that could delay every flight in the country.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PICKETS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Machinists and supporters picketed Eastern terminals. No problems were reported Monday. The Machinists' strike was joined by most <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants and pilots. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> joined picketers, calling <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> one of the `` corporate raiders who take what they can get and leave behind the desiccated hulls of the companies. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to give employees a chance to buy the failing airline and try to save it from bankruptcy. `` If <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> ca n't fly it, let the workers buy it,'' he said.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 None scheduled. The last talks were Friday; they failed to produce an agreement, and the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike began at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>RAILROADS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Monday against secondary picketing at <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. The judge on Sunday issued a similar order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000 commuters daily between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and northern suburbs. Nine other commuter railroads nationwide and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> had been potential targets of sympathy actions. But the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union said it decided to appeal <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s orders and did not set up picket lines at railroads Monday. A hearing was scheduled on both rulings Wednesday.

<HEAD>Twelve Disagree On Strategy To Promote High-Definition TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 12 <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries could not agree Monday on a strategy to defend their high-definition television system and have it adopted worldwide. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ministers of industry differed on the role to be given to the executive <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in promoting the European HDTV system. A single world system will be adopted next year by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiocommunications </ORGANIZATION>. The ministers were scheduled to agree on a declaration asking for the adoption of their system worldwide and setting up a special body to coordinate the action of their governments, the commission and TV equipment industries. Some countries wanted to give the commission a leading role in the strategy, while <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> balked at handing too much power to the executive. HDTV should make TV films as sharp as movies, allowing projection of the same films on either screen. The issue was pased to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ministers of telecommunications, who will meet in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> next month.

 A buyout specialist Monday offered to buy <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest bedding maker and producer of <ORGANIZATION> Sealy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Posturepedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Foster mattresses, in a deal valuing the company at nearly $ 1 billion. `` This is a great day for all our stockholders,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuliger </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION>, which announced Nov. 18 that it had hired an investment banking firm to review a possible sale. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>, with offices in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said it was offering $ 25.50 in cash for 96 percent, or 36.9 million, of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION>' shares. The remaining shares would be exchanged later for shares in the new company. The tender offer alone would cost $ 940 million. The value of the whole company implied by the price of $ 25.50 a share is $ 980 million. The tender offer is dependent on obtaining at least 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION>' shares. The stock jumped $ 2.87 -LCB- a share to $ 24.62 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the news of the bid was `` no big surprise'' given the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> announcement last fall that it was reviewing its possible sale options. `` The price being offered would seem to be a done deal and reasonably close to full value,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. He said it was unlikely <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON> would attempt to sell off much of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mattress </LOCATION> to pay off the takeover debt, noting that most of the company's operations reflected its core bedding business. Any non-bedding operations would be relatively small, he said. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a partner in the investment firm, said the firm was attracted to <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> by its market share, its opportunity for international growth and plans for direct home delivery by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> of products sold by retailers. `` We think we can run the company more efficiently,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest bedding manufacturer, Madrid-based F.L. Betere S.A. -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> Flex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, plans to take a minority participation role in the new company, according to <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The percentage ownership it will have was not disclosed. `` We believe such an international strategic alliance, coupled with domestic opportunities we see for the company to develop its ` home delivery business,' as one example, will enable management to generate an accelerated and even more profitable rate of growth in the years ahead,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> said it received six acquisition offers last Wednesday, three of which were subsequently improved. The other bidders were not disclosed. `` The -LRB- Gibbons, Green -RRB- offer was selected by <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION>' board following its determination that the offer represented the best available transaction for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> stockholders,'' the company said in a statement. The tender offer is expected to begin Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said it has financing commitments from the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. The entire offer will be financed with funds from <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> and its own equity funds, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wuliger </PERSON> said he had been asked by <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to remain as chairman and become an investor in the subsidiary company. For the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 661.5 million and profits of $ 33.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> has 5,555 employees at locations around the nation, <PERSON> Wuliger </PERSON> said. The acquisition would be the 29th by <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, which was founded in 1969 and acts as general partner in three equity buyout funds on behalf of banks, insurance companies, pension funds and university endowments. Its previous acquisitions include Coca-Cola Bottling of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Purex, <ORGANIZATION> Ekco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housewares </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent-a-Car </ORGANIZATION>.

SPX Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said the partnership will be the world's largest maker of piston rings and transmission fluid filters, used in assembling automobiles. The four divisions which will make up <ORGANIZATION> Sealed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> had $ 357 million in sales last year. In addition to piston rings and filters, SPX makes special tools and electronic diagnostics products used after an automobile is sold.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' roughly $ 400 million in cash will drain fast because the strikebound carrier must pay competitors to fly waylaid passengers and it's facing a $ 70 million debt repayment within weeks, a leading debt-rating agency said Monday. `` The strike poses a serious threat to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s survival, and management may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection if more pilots do n't return to work soon,'' <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said in a bulletin about the finances of the Miami-based airline. Eastern was struck by its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union Saturday and pilots and flight attendants have been honoring picket lines. S & amp; P said the airline began the year with $ 402 million in cash but the reserve fell slightly in January and February because of operating losses. Eastern has said it is losing about $ 1 million a day. `` Refunds and payments to other airlines flying passengers ticketed to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will dissipate most of its cash reserves within several weeks,'' S & amp; P's bulletin said. Under so-called interline agreements among airlines, passengers ticketed on Eastern may use their tickets on competitors, which get a reimbursement from the airline later. Eastern has been forced to transfer thousands of passengers from canceled or delayed flights to seats on other airlines. S & amp; P also said Eastern may have to repay $ 70 million worth of unspecified secured debt at the end of March. Secured debt is a loan backed by assets of the borrower, which in Eastern's case could include aircraft.

 Companies based in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were by far the largest purchasers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in 1988, according to a survey released Monday by an international accounting and management consulting firm. British companies bought 420 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies last year in deals valued at $ 32.7 billion, according to the survey by <ORGANIZATION> KPMG </ORGANIZATION> Peat Marwick.

Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies spent $ 9.4 billion last year acquiring 471 foreign firms, the survey found.

 Entertainment and communications issues set the pace as the stock market staged a broad advance Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.53 points to 2,294.82. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by better than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 995 up, 475 down and 486 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 168.88 million shares, up from 151.79 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 200.72 million shares. The big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might be candidates for mergers or takeovers. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock led the active list and jumped 2 -RRB- to 48 \, while <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s shares dropped 1 | to 107 Analysts said Time's decline in part reflected disappointment among traders who had been reckoning that the company might itself have become a takeover candidate at a higher price. <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which owns a 17 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, gained 3 -RCB- to 33 -LCB-. Elsewhere in the communications and entertainment group, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western rose 2 -LCB- to 45 ~; <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> 2 -LRB- to 53; <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> 1 \ to 77 |; <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 16 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> 1 Brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly report by a purchasing managers' group that suggested a slowing of economic growth. That was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest rates. The news got a warm welcome in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose as much as $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 ~ to 24 The company agreed to a $ 25.50-a-share buyout by the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Gibbons </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerongen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shaklee </ORGANIZATION>, subject of a $ 40-a-share bid from a group led by invest <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, rose 4 -RCB- to 38 -RCB-.

 A 17-month labor dispute at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, capped by the virtual shutdown of the strike-torn carrier Monday, displays the power of pilots over their employers. The decision by most of the 3,600 Eastern pilots to join the working-class Machinists' strike dealt a crushing blow to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> after a long history of financial losses and labor-management tensions. And `` pilot power'' is poised to expand its reach Tuesday, when pilots across the country planned a job action that could delay every flight on every major airline. Eastern on day three of the strike said it was shutting down nearly all operations and idling 5,000 to 6,000 workers. The company was quick to blame the pilots, saying it could not afford to continue operating because they had honored the Machinists' picket lines. `` The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Why did Eastern pilots, who earn an average $ 80,000 a year, cast their lot with mechanics and baggage handlers who make about $ 19 and $ 15 an hour respectively? `` The older pilots do n't have a chance to go to another airline,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, an Eastern pilot. `` We're going to lose our profession.'' `` The fact that we're out here -LRB- picketing -RRB- is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, period,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, 47, who has flown for Eastern for 22 years. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who controls <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> through parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been a lightning rod for the pilots' anger. He is widely mistrusted by pilots and other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers because of what they call his triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. They also accuse <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of diverting precious <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The Eastern pilots have been torn between their dislike for <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and reluctance to quit the airline and sacrifice years of seniority. A shortage of pilots nationwide means they could easily find jobs at other airlines, but they would have to relinquish seniority and accept lower pay and benefits, said <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The job market -LRB- for pilots -RRB- is extremely good,'' <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> said, noting that the airline pilots earn an average $ 82,500 a year plus substantial benefits. Eastern had said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying during the strike, but the pilots union put the number at 88. Eastern has operated only a fraction of its customary 1,040 daily flights during the strike. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> has asked all pilots nationwide to strictly follow aviation rules Tuesday `` to ensure the safety of the -LRB- air traffic -RRB- system,'' which he said had been weakened by the Eastern disruptions. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the action would slow air traffic, but insisted that was not the intent. `` We expect a very good response from pilots at all carriers,'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> said. `` Pilots are going to recognize that there are problems generated out of the Eastern strike that have a ripple effect throughout the system.'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> pilots prepared to join the slowdown, and pilots at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> also expressed support.

<HEAD>Software Company Wins Violated Copyright Case</HEAD>

 A federal judge has ruled in favor of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> software company in a copyright infringement case that may protect software manufacturers against what is called the `` look and feel'' of clones. The judge, in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, ruled recently that three competitors infringed on the copyright of the Costimator program made by <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. The Costimator helps users to estimate the time and cost of manufacturing parts. The competitors did not copy the mechanics of the Costimator software but duplicated its on-screen appearance, what is commonly called the `` look and feel'' of the program. The ruling was made in late January, but <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday that they delayed publicizing the decision until the 30-day appeal period had expired.

<HEAD>Aerospace Company Fined $5.5 Million For Defense Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 5.5 million Monday for double-billing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> on a navigation satellite. The company, which pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of court in the case but maintained it was innocent, vowed to appeal the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> fine. The El Segundo-based aerospace and manufacturing company was fined $ 500,000 for an alleged conspircy among some of its managers to double bill the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> by approximately $ 450,000 on the NAVSTAR navigation satellite system between 1982 and 1984. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Consuelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> ordered a $ 5 million fine for a contempt of court charge brought against <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> because the terms of settlement of an earlier, unrelated case barred the company from fraudulent billing. The fine for contempt of court is unlimited. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> also was sentenced to five years' probation. The company's attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, vowed to appeal the fine. On Jan. 19, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> entered a conditional plea of guilty to the charges in an agreement with prosecutors under which a number of related charges were dismissed. The conditional plea was based on the company's appeal of an early ruling in the case to a higher court. If that appeal were to succeed, the company hoped to have its guilty plea erased from the record. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> maintained the fraud was perpetrated by division managers without the knowledge or consent of upper management. In the earlier ruling, the judge rejected a company motion to throw the case out of court on grounds that <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> had reported the fraud under provisions of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> program intended to encourage defense contractors to report dishonesty. Since it entered its plea, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> has engaged in a public relations campaign portraying itself as a victim of overzealous prosecution, and maintaining that the example of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s case would deter other defense contractors from reporting fraud under the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s voluntary disclosure program. Federal prosecutors maintain that <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> did n't report the fraud until after auditors were on the trail. The case involves billing for repairs to the satellite's radio gear performed by a subcontractor, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s defense communications division. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> was n't a defendant. A <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> manager, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavodnik </PERSON>, 47, has pleaded guilty to lying to the government and conspiracy in the case. His supervisor, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, 60, was acquitted of the same charges by a federal jury.
