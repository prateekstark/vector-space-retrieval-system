<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met Tuesday with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> to thank the union officials for their support in his election to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, according to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman. The meeting included six Teamsters officials who are scheduled to go on trial next month as the result of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civil suit accusing them of racketeering, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Wednesday editions. The brief session was held in the office of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming chief of staff, said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The meeting had not been publicly announced. `` The Teamsters people were meeting with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and the president-elect simply stopped by briefly. The purpose was to thank them for their support during the election campaign,'' she said. The meeting was set up by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. The Post reported that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> noted the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> case against the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> but said any discussion of the case would be inappropriate in the meeting. Last June, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, charging that the Teamsters were infiltrated by organized crime and urging a federal court to put the union under government trusteeship. The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 27 and the 18 defendants include <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and others in the group who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the Post reported. In 1981 and 1985, after the election of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had appeared at the union's board meetings during inaugural week to thank the organization for endorsing the Reagan-Bush ticket. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, the meeting Tuesday was in lieu of a public appearance by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a Teamsters' board meeting, which union officials had sought.

 A young drifter wearing combat fatigues opened fire with an assault rifle at screaming children in an elementary school yard Tuesday. Five children, all refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, were killed and 30 people wounded before the gunman shot himself to death. The gunman, identified as <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, 26, originally of <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, had an `` extensive criminal history'' but police had `` no idea'' of a motive, said <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, deputy police chief of this agricultural city 60 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,'' said <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, who teaches deaf children at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and ran to her window when she heard what she thought were firecrackers. She said she saw a man standing in the schoolyard, spraying gunfire back and forth from a Russian AK-47 assault rifle as 400-500 pupils from grades 1-3 played at recess. She said when she realized what was happening, she took her 10 students into a rear room where they could n't be seen. `` He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very straight-faced, it did not look like he was really angry, it was just matter-of-factly,'' she said of the gunman, whom she described as about 5-10 with short dirty-blond hair. `` There was mass chaos. There were kids running in every direction,'' she said. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had lived most recently in <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northeast of here. Prior to that he lived in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, where he purchased an AK-47 from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 3., said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s criminal record was mostly in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and included narcotics and weapons violations and soliciting for sex, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had lived with an aunt and uncle in <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> for several months until October and the aunt, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, `` told me he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic.'' He said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> also had apparently been living in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> since leaving <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. The gunman, dressed in battle gear and wearing a flak jacket, parked his car near the school, then set it on fire as a diversion before entering the campus through a gap in a fence at about 11:40 a.m. PST with two handguns and an AK-47 `` with a full banana clip,'' police said. He opened fire on the west side of a group of portable classrooms, then moved to the east side and continued firing across the blacktop yard, towards the main buildings about 250 yards away, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> was no closer than that when he shot himself in the head, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. About 60 rounds were fired; in some cases, the bullets went completely through the main school building and came out the other side to fall spent on the L-shaped school's front lawn, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. As police cleaned up the carnage, a large handgun and the AK-47 were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood. Written on the pistol's handle was the word `` Victory.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said five pupils were killed and 29 wounded in the schoolyard. A teacher was also shot. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said two of the dead children were dragged inside the school by teachers. At least 15 of the wounded were in critical condition, he said. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said the dead children all belonged to refugee families from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He identified them as Raphanar Or, 9; <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 8; <PERSON> Thuy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON>, 6; Sokhim An, 6; and <PERSON> Oeun </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>, 8. <PERSON> Thuy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> was from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, the others from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Officials said about 60 percent of the pupils at the school were from Southeast Asian refugee families. Three of the children were slain in the yard, and the two others inside the school, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribble </PERSON>. He said at least one teacher was injured. `` There were a dozen students lying on the ground. It was very frightening,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, who rushed to the school where her 11-year-old daughter, <PERSON> LeAnne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundstrom </PERSON>, is a pupil. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said the wounded were evacuated to eight hospitals in the area. Two helicopters and a fleet of ambulances were pressed into service to transport the victims. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Billedo </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a pupil at the school, described seeing a schoolmate shot. `` I just saw him fall down,'' said <PERSON> Billedo </PERSON>. `` His head hit the ground. The teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other classroom.'' `` Some kids were outside and some man came over here shooting like crazy. A few kids got shot,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 10, a fifth grader. `` They were shooting at my classroom and at -LRB- <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s -RRB- classroom at reading time,'' said another pupil, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>. `` The bullets were hitting the walls. Everybody got scared.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON>, visiting a friend across from the school when he heard gunfire, ran to the scene. `` When you see bodies lying on a playground, you know it's, you know ...,'' <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> said, his voice trailing off. `` I tried to get a pulse, could n't get a pulse. I was hoping an ambulance would show up. It seemed to take forever.'' The school, about four blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> campus, is in a middle-class residential area. Several churches are nearby. The AK-47 is a Russian design, but Chinese replicas are available in many gun stores for around $ 300. It is capable of firing about 600 rounds per minute on full automatic. Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> described the AK-47 as a `` military assault rifle. You use it for one purpose and one purpose only _ to kill a human being.'' Under federal law, the purchase of a fully automatic rifle or machine gun requires a 4-6 month background check by authorities; however, a semiautomatic rifle can be bought over the counter by completing a standard form stating that the applicant has no criminal record, among other requirements. <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said that the AK-47 and other semiautomatic rifles can be easily converted into automatics. Other schools across the nation have been the targets for violent attacks in recent years. Last Sept. 26, a man walked into <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and opened fire with a gun in a crowded cafeteria and in a third-grade classroom. Two 8-year-old girls died, and nine other people were wounded, including two teachers. The gunman, identified by police as <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, was charged with murder and is awaiting trial. Last May 20, a young woman named <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> went on a rampage at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, killing an 8-year-old boy and wounding five other children. She fled to a nearby home where she wounded one man and then killed herself.

<TEXT>
 Within hours of the schoolyard shootings that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday, dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asian parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their youngsters. `` I would imagine it is absolute panic. They are not sure what happened, not sure what's going on around them,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Charterhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> refugee program, in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, describing the scene translators found when they arrived at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to ask whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and opened fire before taking his own life. `` They do have people on staff at the hospital, but they are so overloaded they need every extra person they can secure,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, whose organization began calling throughout <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> for volunteers speaking Southeast Asian languages. About a dozen translators were sent to the county hospital, after officials there called for help. In recent years, thousands of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asians </LOCATION> have settled in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish in the area. School officials said 60 percent of the children were Southeast Asian refugees _ either from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. All five of the children killed were of this background, authorities said. A Stockton woman who runs an after-school program teaching English to Cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators, including volunteers from all over the city, to the school and the hospital, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> a grief center might be established at Charterhouse to help survivors, whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier.

<TEXT>
 Fully equipped Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the planeload during the past week, but the aircraft also left tons of new arms and ammunition for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. Western diplomats, speaking in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on condition they not be identified further, said that at the current pace, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal could be completed by the end of the month `` However, for political reasons the Russians may wish to keep a military presence in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> up to Feb. 15,'' said one source. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pledged in a U.N.-sponsored accord last year to remove all of its more than 100,000 combat troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in nine months from May 15, 1988. But the country's ruling Marxists still have not reached a settlement with Moslem rebels known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors, who have battled them for more than a decade. Diplomats said takeoffs and landings of Soviet IL-76 transport planes at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport numbered about 40 between Jan. 9 and 14, or double the usual rate. Armed Soviet troops in full kit were seen boarding the planes but only after Afghan troops unloaded large quantities of military equipment and ammunition. As many as 18 SS-1 `` Scud'' missiles were transported from the airport during the period, according to reports from diplomats and Western journalists. Soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the <LOCATION> Hindukush </LOCATION> mountains along the snowbound <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> which runs some 240 miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> north to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the sources said. They said that judging by convoys arriving in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Soviet-Afghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route open despite harassment by the mujahedeen. Diplomats said workmen have been busy cutting down trees and leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet Embassy in southern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. One source speculated that the work was to prepare an emergency airstrip next to the Soviet mission. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> continue to accuse <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the rebels, many of whom operate from bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The death toll rose to eight Monday in the city's worst fire in 24 years and authorities said a man smoking in bed may have caused the blaze that ravaged a three-story rooming house. <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> Fire Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said the house originally was a two-family dwelling, which had been illegally converted into a rooming house by its owner, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. It was not immediately known if charges would be filed against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said the heaviest fire damage was in the vicinity of a cot used by the smoker, a man who was not identified. `` We're probably looking at smoking. The victim is reported to be a heavy smoker'' and drinker, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. He said the man was intoxicated the night of the fire. The eighth person to die from injuries suffered in the Sunday fire was identified as <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON>, 77, and 45-year-old son, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, died in the fire from burns and smoke inhalation, said Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, the deputy medical examiner. He said an autopsy on Mrs. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> was scheduled for Tuesday. The other fire victims were identified as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 52, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Prioleau </PERSON>, 61, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON>, 30. Two of the bodies were found inside the front door. Authorities said the men had been unable to open the door because it had been locked from the inside and required a key to open. Seven people were injured in the blaze. Eleven to 15 people were living in the house, officials said.

<TEXT>
 A gynecologist who faces charges from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in connection with what he calls `` love surgery'' has offered to surrender his certificate to practice medicine, his attorney said Tuesday. Lawyer <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he and Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> made the offer during a meeting with state officials in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. `` We offered to surrender the license and dispense with the hearing,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` Whether they do that or not, I do n't know. Otherwise, we'll go ahead with the hearing.'' The board has charged the 67-year-old <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> with `` gross immorality'' for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries. Most of the charges against <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> have to do with the controversial surgery in which he rebuilt women's genital areas, allegedly to enhance their sexual responsiveness. The surgery, however, instead caused sexual dysfunction, emotional distress, infection, chronic pain, incontinence and the need for corrective surgery in many patients, the board charged. Last month, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> sent a letter to the board denying the charges and requesting a hearing. The board tentatively set a Jan. 30 hearing date. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> predicted that such a hearing would last six weeks. And he said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has, in effect, retired anyway. `` He's not practicing any medicine at all,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` We offered to surrender the certificate to practice medicine and surgery. I'm certain that he feels they will ultimately revoke his license. He feels it's a worthless cause.'' Calls to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s office went unanswered, and no one answered the phone at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Board spokeswoman <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubow </PERSON> has said the severest penalty the state board could impose would be permanent revocation of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s license The board limited <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> to non-surgical medical practice last November. At least three of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s former patients have each filed $ 3 million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has denied performing the surgery without his patients' permission The surgery was last performed in February 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Thoroughly Modern Nuns Audition for Part in Hit Musical</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 She wore black stretch pants, a sequined vest and a top hat. Sister <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> did not look like a nun. Sister <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> looked the part in full Carmelite habit and veil. But she did n't act it: She took to center stage like a veteran performer and played snappy spoons to a bluegrass tune. Life imitated show business Monday as about a dozen real-life nuns showed up at the Charles Street Playhouse to audition for the musical `` Nunsense,'' a gentle spoof of convent life. Judging their performances was a panel of nun-impersonators, the show's regular cast. The habit-wearing actresses sing, clown and even tapdance in an off-beat comedy about nuns who stage a talent show to raise money to bury four of their sisters who died of botulism and are being temporarily stored in the convent freezer. The five real-life nuns judged most talented will each be given a cameo role in the show for one week in February or March. The producers billed the audition as `` Nunsearch'' and advertised for `` real nuns'' in Catholic and secular newspapers. They have promised to donate $ 2 from every ticket sold for the special shows to a charity chosen by the performing nun. `` We're constantly getting mail from nuns and priests who love the show,'' said co-producer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Biller </PERSON>. `` We're doing it to raise some money for charity and also of course to get publicity.'' `` Nunsense,'' written by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goggin </PERSON>, has played in 30 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities since its 1985 debut, <PERSON> Biller </PERSON> said. It's now playing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, is entering its third season in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, he said. Some of the nuns who auditioned said they had dreamed of stage careers before taking the veil. `` I always wanted to go to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' said Sister <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuhrman </PERSON>, 37, who works with the elderly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` But I just knew I belonged in the convent.'' `` When you get past 30, you start to say, I wish I'd done this, I wish I'd done that,'' she said. `` Even if I do n't make the part, at least I can say I auditioned for an off-Broadway show.'' Sister <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, who confessed to sweaty palms, delivered a comic monologue while her sisters and her mother superior cheered her bravery. `` You see nuns on TV, they're such stereotypes of pious, holier than thou types, and they're such stuffed shirts and prudes,'' she said. `` We're not all that stuffy.'' Sister <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> was a professional dancer and even owned her own dance studio before entering the Sisters of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> convent at age 28. Now grey-haired, she performed a jazz number to the tune of `` City Lights'' _ complete with shoulder rolls, high-kicks, and the splits for a finale. Sister <PERSON> Brigid </PERSON> of the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and Infirm in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said she decided to perform her wooden spoon routine in hopes of attracting more young women to her order. `` We are getting acolytes and novitiates, but not as many as we did,'' she said, adding that she believes that nuns' participation in a professional musical will show young women `` we're not just behind the walls doing our work. There is joy.''

Both Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Colby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, have big voices, with beautiful, lush tone in all parts of the register. However much vocal control, breath, volume or musicianship is called for, they're equal to it and there's plenty more where that came from. Their characterizations _ as set by <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvefelt </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Bolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, making his Met debut _ were right on target. As the curtain goes up, newlyweds <PERSON> Bluebeard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> have just arrived at Bluebeard's dark castle. As <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> asks for the key to one door after another, she goes from a cheery, inquisitive girl to being imperially demanding. <PERSON> Bluebeard </PERSON> goes from pride to cringing, knowing what's coming and dreading it. As <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> opens doors and takes from him parts of his past, <PERSON> Bluebeard </PERSON> takes off parts of his garb, starting with the dark glasses that have given his white face a skeletal look, through fur collar, coat, cloak, shirt and finally wig. The remarkable set is by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schavernoch </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, making his Met debut. Side walls extend inward, meeting in a V, so that one does n't have to sit in the center to see the walls. One wall folds back, when <PERSON> Bluebeard </PERSON> shows <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> the world. The other wall has the doors, through which implements of torture, a battering ram, a big pile of gold and jewels and a tall tree appear. When the last door opens, revealing the three wives Bluebeard murdered, they appear as zombies who crawl forth and walk, silently. <PERSON> Bluebeard </PERSON> puts the cloak of death on <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> and she follows them, moving like a queen. Her red gown and cloak were magnificent. Lore <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, who has worked extensively with <PERSON> Schavernoch </PERSON>, also was making her Met debut. When `` Bluebeard's Castle'' was performed by the Met in 1974, the concept was nothing like this. It was almost a concert. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> conducted with deliberate care. The orchestral music contains some chilling moments. Miss <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s singing was just as remarkable in `` Erwartung.'' But it's a letdown after the other opera. It's sung in German and the plot is impenetrable. `` The Woman'' is searching for a man in a forest. Once she finds a corpse and puts his hand on her skin to warm it. The next time she's at that part of the stage, the corpse is gone. Is she crazy? Did she kill him? Is she hallucinating? The same design team used the other opera's backdrop, plus three autumn trees, a park bench, flowers, candles and a grand piano. The only thing we objected to all evening was the piano and Miss Norman running between it and the bench. `` Erwartung'' is confusing enough. The Feb. 1 performance will be videotaped for showing March 31 on PBS.

 Eight-year-old <PERSON> Domingos </PERSON> <PERSON> Casela </PERSON> was walking through a field to his family's small corn patch and stepped on a mine. <PERSON> Domingos </PERSON> and thousands like him are maimed reminders of a civil war neither side is able to win. The conflict has gripped <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975, causing stagnation and desolation in one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most richly endowed nations. Several months after <PERSON> Domingos </PERSON> stepped on the mine, he hobbled up a ramp at the <ORGANIZATION> Kuito-Bie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with a rubber-tipped metal rod in place of his lower left leg, undergoing physical therapy to prepare for the artificial limb he will wear the rest of his life. His doctors say the mine was planted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. The U.S.-supported rebels are fighting a war of attrition against the Marxist government of the Angolan <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Portuguese initials <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it halted 13 years of aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> after signing a U.S.-mediated accord Dec. 22 with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has controlled since World War I. All South African troops in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> moved back across the border to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> when a truce between the two nations began Aug. 8. Dr. <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Salongue </PERSON>, director of the rehabilitation center in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s fertile central highlands, said most of amputees being treated were victims of mines planted by <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. Others lost limbs when gangrene set in because rifle wounds were poorly tended, he said. Visitors to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>, in southeastern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, see amputees of the other side who stepped on mines planted by the Cuban-supported army to impede rebel advances. Many victims of the war are Ovimbundu, the people of central <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bie </LOCATION> provinces who in 1960 were 38 percent of the 5 million living in a colony 14 times the size of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, 54, is an Ovimbundu. His father worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Caminho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benguela </ORGANIZATION>, the railway on which agricultural products and ores from <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> once rolled to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> ports of <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lobito </LOCATION>. Today, the <LOCATION> Cunje </LOCATION> railway station four miles outside <LOCATION> Kuito </LOCATION> is a mass of broken bricks and shards of blue-and-white Portuguese tiles, target of a <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> attack. Grass and wildflowers grow between the rails. Five huge steam locomotives built by <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> and Co.. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, rust on sidings with no place to go since <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> blew up the bridges between <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuito </LOCATION> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, 54 years a railroader, still shows up at the yard each day. He said people on both sides are weary of war and eager for the railway to run again so their corn, bananas and millet can go to market and they can receive goods from the outside. An international conference is scheduled for Jan. 25-26 in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, to raise funds for a 10-year development plan in the <LOCATION> Lobito </LOCATION> corridor, including reconstruction of the <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> railway. The conference is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coodination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The cost of re-opening the railroad has been estimated at $ 300 - $ 600 million <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Cuneen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, fears potential donor nations may balk at committing substantial funds because the war has made it impossible to conduct a technical study in the region. He and others involved in development projects feel withdrawal of Cuban troops, which began Jan. 10 and is to be finished by mid-1991, could lead to more economic aid and development if the civil war also ends. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will not negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and seeks diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His government has declared a year-long amnesty to begin Feb. 4, which spokesman <PERSON> Paulinho </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> says will be open to all renounce violence and accept the constitution. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has written <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, however, promising continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support until the government does negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. Covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the rebels was blocked for a decade by a 1975 congressional amendment, but resumed in 1986 and is said to total about $ 15 million annually. A Western diplomat said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policy toward <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was `` outdated'' and the Marxism espoused by the ruling ruling party was `` only skin deep.'' `` You'll see; this is not a Marxist nation,'' he said. `` Nearly all their trade is with the West. When the Cubans have left, then they'll get rid of the Russians.''

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s guerrillas have refrained from attacking Israeli targets for the past two months, observing an undeclared cease-fire that could give credibility to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s peace initiative if it endures. Some <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have called attention to the lack of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> operations but have expressed doubt about <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s ability or even desire to make it last. `` We have not identified any flagrant act on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> against the security zone or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> committed himself'' to end terrorism, said <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official responsible for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> policy. `` I think it is too early to judge'' if the truce would be lasting, <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said in an interview it was `` not 100 percent clear'' whether the cease-fire encompassed only <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s own Fatah guerrillas or all <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> factions. There have been two recent infiltration attempts by Syrian-based groups, one headed by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> which is outside the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> umbrella and the other, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli soldiers killed six of the guerrillas. The last attack by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> came on the eve of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of statehood in mid-November when a five-member <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> squad took <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and Lebanese civilians hostage for 18 hours The guerrillas shot to death one Lebanese man before surrendering. <PERSON> Anat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON>, a terrorism expert at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that a cease-fire would have to be more enduring to overcome Israeli suspicion about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will change people's mind if it lasts longer,'' she said. <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had never renounced armed struggle or the right to attack targets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but said it was in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s interest to suspend anti-Israeli attacks to give his initiative credibility, especially with Western countries. However, she said there were serious doubts among Israeli policymakers about whether <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> could tolerate a long period of inaction without clear political gains. The center estimates <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> has about 8,000 guerrillas, or half the total number of Palestinians under arms. Most are based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many Israelis, especially those on the political right, view the 13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as a form of terrorism aimed at destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON>, former head of military intelligence, said a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire would not be effective in dispelling Israeli doubts unless <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> specified its duration and made it comprehensive. `` For Israelis, it does n't matter which group stands behind an operation. The question that counts if whether attacks continue,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON> said the test of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s credibility was whether he was willing or able to force dissident factions to observe a truce both in cross-border raids and in violent acts in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` If he ca n't, then he is no authority we should be talking to,'' said <PERSON> Gazit </PERSON>, noting <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> succeeded in forcing opponents to observe a military stand in 1981 along the Israel-Lebanon border. The de facto truce already has touched off a public quarrel between Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and the armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, who appeared to challenge <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s policy by pointing out the de facto cease-fire <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> described as `` superfluous'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>'s report to a parliament committee that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> and other guerrillas under his authority had `` in practice halted hostile operations'' as well as preparations for attacks. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, confirmed the prime minister disagreed with chief of staff over the issue and accused <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of encouraging daily acts of terror. `` Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> believes there is a lot of terrorism by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in the territories -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> proper,'' said <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, noting a <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> cell recently had been uncovered in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` There are acts of terrorism daily in the territories and attempts in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> encourages those,'' he added. The hawkish premier has opposed any conciliatory move toward the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in response to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism and acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sought to replace <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and could not be trusted. `` I am sure there are those who understand that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> can not trust what the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> says. We know them too well,'' he said. The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> said security officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> this month it was their assessment that certain <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> groups were liable to attempt to carry out border raids but not under the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s name. The purpose of such attacks would be to gauge the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response, it said. For Israeli doves, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declarations have been enough to trigger calls for the government to agree to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Four members of parliament participated in a conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> attended by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members but avoided face-to-face talks because of a 1986 Israeli laws outlawing such contacts. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>, a dovish lawmaker who supports negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> this week that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s change of principles was more difficult to achieve than a change in policy on attacks `` It's generally easier to change the pratical than the rhetorical. For <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> it is much easlier to stop engaging in terror than to announce its end,'' said <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON>.

 There's something for everyone who wants a memento of the 41st president's inauguration, ranging from a $ 1,200 crystal eagle for high-rollers to commemorative buttons for a buck. The official sales booths do n't open until later this week, but souvenir stands along the Mall already are hawking sweatshirts and buttons with pictures of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Tourists can get a sweatshirt for $ 12 or pay $ 5 for a `` Republican Integrity'' button with pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Presidents <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Two dollars will buy a gaudy button with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s faces atop a color photo of the last inaugural ceremony, while smaller buttons go for $ 1. Sales have been slow thus far, according to one souvenir salesman who said he hopes more people will be in the mood to buy trinkets as Friday's inaugural approaches. People bought many more souvenirs when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office, another salesman said. `` When he was first elected eight years ago it was _ boom _ big market,'' said the salesman, who declined to give his name. `` Now -LRB- sales are -RRB- not even one-third of that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaugural committee hopes to rake in the cash through a souvenir sales catalogue it mailed to 1.5 million Republicans, historians and collectors. People with a lot to spend can pay $ 1,195 for a <LOCATION> Steuben </LOCATION> crystal eagle `` depicting courage, splendor and freedom in many lands,'' according to the catalogue. A crystal ice bucket with the official inaugural seal goes for $ 175. The catalogue also offers commemorative coins, key rings, golf caps, umbrellas and playing cards. For $ 75, folks can wrap up in a terrycloth bathrobe with the inaugural seal. Spices for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> chili, barbecue and gumbo sell for $ 2.50 each. T-shirts and sweatshirts celebrating the bicentennial inaugural's `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> to <PERSON> George </PERSON>'' theme _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ sell for $ 10 to $ 44.95 And, people can pay up to $ 60 for a red, white and blue inaugural auto license plate that is good until March 31. The inaugural committee also has contracted with Creative Photo Crafts of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to operate 21 sales booths along the inaugural parade route to sell items including mittens, chocolate bars and pennants. The first booth opens Tuesday, while two more open Thursday and the rest will operate only on inaugural day. `` It all depends on the weather,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON>, president of Creative Photo Crafts. Four years ago, the inaugural parade was canceled as temperatures dived toward zero. `` We're betting that the weather's going to be nice,'' <PERSON> Baltes </PERSON> said. His company will be selling more expensive items at some of the official inaugural events, including a $ 60 embroidered sweatshirt. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service is offering a different kind of souvenir _ inaugural stamp cancellations from several cities, such as <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, associated with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. For $ 4.95, post offices across the country are selling a Bicentennial Inaugural Memento with envelopes bearing the special inaugural cancellations. Otherwise, people who do n't get to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week must rely on the mail-order catalogue for their souvenirs. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s honeymoon with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be over by the time the merchandise arrives _ delivery on many items is expected to take up to 90 days.

<HEAD>DOD Audit Says Change Use Of Civilians In Combat-Essential Positions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Imagine going off to combat only to find the civilian technician who keeps your sophisticated weapons working is n't interested in sticking around. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general is warning of such a potential problem. The independent inspector general, in a 24-page audit that recently became available, says the Pentagon's procedures for designating and staffing `` emergency-essential'' civilian jobs overseas need to be overhauled. Those are jobs critical to making sure military equipment functions at the battlefront. Many of the jobs have been described previously as involving the maintenance of highly sophisticated electronic and computer gear. `` Our audit showed that implementation of DoD's programs to retain emergency-essential civilians did not afford a high degree of assurance that civilian or contractor employees would continue to perform functions and services overseas that are essential to the support of combat forces during mobilization or hostilities,'' the audit states. The people now holding the jobs `` were not informed fully of their commitment or about their benefits,'' the audit continues. Moreover, of 228 civilian DoD employees who were personally interviewed by auditors, `` 28 had not volunteered to remain on the job during crises or hostilities because of family responsibilities, and there was no evidence of contingency plans to replace these incumbents.'' `` We also found that 2 of the 228 emergency-essential positions -LRB- in this group -RRB- were occupied by persons not physically fit to serve in a war zone.'' On the flip side, some of the positions designated `` emergency-essential'' appear to be more `` desirable'' to have filled than essential _ meaning those civilians might be asked to stay in a war zone when they're really not needed, the auditors said. The number of people involved is relatively small, the auditors continued. Exact totals are n't available, but it appears the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employs about 3,700 civilians overseas in jobs designated emergency essential, while contractors working for the military employ several thousand more. Nonetheless, the military services had better address the issue because legally, they're depending upon volunteers. `` Under current law, civilians can not be required to stay on jobs during mobilization, hostile action or an undeclared war,'' the auditors wrote. `` Unless and until the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> declares war, DoD and contractor civilian employees may remain in, or be sent to, unsafe areas overseas only on a voluntary basis.'' The audit states that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> civilians assigned to emergency-essential jobs since 1985 are supposed to be volunteers who understand that if fighting breaks out, they'll be expected to remain at their post. `` And historically, DoD civilian employees and contractors have served in hostile areas in time of need,'' the inspector general said. `` However, there are no absolute assurances that a DoD civilian employee or a contractor's employee would honor a commitment to voluntarily remain on the job during hostilities.'' The inspector general recommended the services review the emergency-essential jobs to make sure they really are just that; establish physical and medical standards for the positions; explain the `` legal and administrative ramifications attendant to acceptance of the position''; and make sure every job holder knows his `` specific wartime duties.'' The auditors said the military should use soldiers to carry out any function that is essential to fighting. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the assistant defense secretary for personnel, responded to the audit by saying his office and the armed services `` concur in your assessment and endorse the positive recommendations.''

<HEAD>Summer's Drought Makes Self Felt In Winter For Cattle Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's already a rough winter for those cattle producers who have to buy higher-priced hay and grain to make up for last year's drought-ravaged pastures and feed crops, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. The financial bind of recent years has forced cattle producers to cut back herds and delay new expansion plans. That has reduced beef output sharply and sent prices to record levels at supermarket counters. It will get worse before improving, the analysts say. Cattle production prices are edging still higher, and so are consumer beef prices _ which could threaten to make family shoppers think about pork and chicken instead of beef. As of Dec. 1, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> surveys, hay stockpiles nationally totaled less than 90.9 million tons, down almost a fourth from more than 119.8 million tons a year earlier. Prices of baled hay, including alfalfa and other kinds, averaged almost $ 97 per ton last month, up from less than $ 65 in December 1987. Moreover, in some of the hardest-hit drought states hay stockpiles are a fraction of their year-ago level. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, for example, Dec. 1 inventories were estimated at little more than 2.3 million tons, compared with nearly 5.3 million tons a year earlier. Cattle production costs `` may rise modestly'' in 1989, says a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Decisions to open up this year's feed grains programs to a larger acreage may ease the supply and price situation later on, but prospects will not be firmed up before July and August. Meanwhile, the agency said in the January-February issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, 1989 beef production is expected to decline 5 percent to 7 percent from last year, the lowest level since 1980. However, larger supplies of poultry and pork are expected. That would leave this year's total meat supply at only slightly below the 1988 record, the report said. Even so, retail beef prices are expected to reach a record level. `` Rising consumer incomes and high employment rates likely will provide continued support for meat prices,'' the report said. `` A favorable economic environment will have to be maintained if record retail beef prices expected in 1989 are to be met with little consumer resistance.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle inventory on Jan. 1, 1988, dropped below 100 million head for the first time since 1961, and the 1987 and 1988 calf crops also were the smallest since 1961. A new estimate on the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cattle herd on Jan. 1, 1989, will be issued by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 8, and may show a further decline, according to agency economists. The decline in 1989 beef output will be abetted by a continued slide in the slaughter of `` non-fed'' cattle, which includes culled cows and other animals that are sold without going through feedlots. `` But the biggest impact on total -LRB- beef -RRB- supplies will come from sharply reduced fed cattle slaughter,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> feedlot marketings for 1989 could decline 6 percent to 8 percent, or about 2 million head.'' The winding down of the placement of new animals in feedlots last summer and fall `` may have set the stage for record prices next spring,'' the report said. Prices for Choice steers on the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, market in 1989 could average near the mid - $ 70s per 100 pounds of live weight, up from $ 70 last year Retail beef prices rose an average of almost 5 percent in 1988, hitting a record peak last summer when they averaged $ 2.59 per pound, as measured on <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s all-cut basis. Further increases of 1 percent to 3 percent are likely this year. `` The higher price of beef relative to competing meats has always been a concern, but 1989 may test consumer demand for beef,'' the report said. Per capita consumption of all meat, including poultry, averaged 220.5 pounds in 1988 but could drop back to 217.4 pounds in 1989. Those are retail weights before home trimming, cooking and table waste is computed. Beef exports in 1988 rose 8 percent to an estimated 654 million pounds, carcass weight equivalent, the report said. And another increases is expected this year, mainly because of larger sales to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Even so, this year's greater exports would represent only 2.8 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production. Imports of beef in 1988, meanwhile, totaled about 2.4 billion pounds, carcass weight, up 4 percent from 1987, but may decline this year because of smaller supplies in exporting countries, mainly <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The imports represent less than 9 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef consumption.

 A Soviet teen-ager unable to find a cure in her native country for a heart condition she has had since birth arrived Monday for treatment and a tearful welcome from relatives she had never seen. Seventeen-year-old <PERSON> Oksana </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlebkyna </PERSON> received a traditional Ukrainian greeting _ a loaf of round, wholesome bread, garnished with a container of salt, and red and white flowers _ when she was wheeled into the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> airport terminal. Six youngsters clad in traditional Ukrainian garb _ white blouses with intricate embroidery on the sleeves and dark skirts or trousers _ sang for Miss <PERSON> Hlebkyna </PERSON>. `` The name of the song is ` Long Live,''' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosola </PERSON>, 69, who arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1955 along with his wife, <PERSON> Kateryna </PERSON>, the ailing young woman's great-aunt. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosola </PERSON>, relaying the teen-ager's thanks, said the trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was Miss <PERSON> Hlebkyna </PERSON>'s most coveted wish. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosola </PERSON> said surgeon <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diethrich </PERSON> and administrator <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., helped make arrangements <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said it was n't immediately known what doctors could do for Miss Hlebkyna `` We are not able to state what kind of medical problem she has, because we do n't know,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` Most of the documents we received were in Russian, and none of us here speak Russian. Tomorrow morning, she will begin to undergo medical evaluation.'' Miss <PERSON> Hlebkyna </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Wladymyra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobkowa </PERSON>, made the trip from their hometown of <LOCATION> Stryj </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week and flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and Air West airlines flew the pair for free, Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. Doctors at the AHI `` are prepared to donate their services if need be ... We are not making an issue of the financial arrangements,'' said Miss <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the institute's director of acute intervention and transplant services. She said institute officials had been told <PERSON> Oksana </PERSON>'s condition was life-threatening and was affecting her lungs. `` From what we understand, she has a very abnormal heart disease. It's one that she's had since birth, and it's not feasible that she live with it,'' Miss <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Rosolas </PERSON> left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> almost 45 years ago, captives of a German army. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosola </PERSON> said she did not learn until seven years ago of her grand-niece's heart problems. That knowledge spurred her efforts, ever more intense, to find a way to bring Miss Hlebkyna to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 For 50 cents, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. `` Mutt'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> will let you drive a car across his <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> toll bridge. For $ 175,000, he'll throw in the bridge, too. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> has been trying to sell the bridge for more than a year, but so far there have been no takers. `` I could probably tell them all they had to know about maintaining the bridge or who could do it,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 69, said recently. `` I'm retired. I do n't need it.'' The one-lane, oak-plank bridge, 12 feet wide and 360 feet long, connects this western <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> town of 550 people with <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> Built in 1937, the bridge saves considerable time for Oldtown residents who commute to work in Green Spring and for West Virginians heading for <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The alternative is a 40-mile one-way trip via <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, or Paw Paw, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The span is submerged several times a year under high water, but has survived more than 50 years of ice floes and floods. Bridge users drop their tolls into a tin cup bolted to a truncated barbecue skewer, which toll takers hold out the window of a little brick house on the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> shore. Cars pay 50 cents, pedestrians a dime, motorcycles a quarter and tractor-trailers $ 1.50. Motorists can use the bridge free between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, a retired excavator and mail carrier, had done maintenance on the bridge since 1954. In 1970, he bought it for $ 53,000. `` If somebody wanted to run it themself, they could make a good living,'' he said. `` I make $ 30,000 to $ 34,000 clear, and I do n't do nothing other than take the money to the bank.''

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will receive a $ 45,500 pay raise this year if lawmakers follow President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recommendations, while a recently hired government typist would bring home just $ 250 more The third-ranking official in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or another <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> agency would get a $ 42,500 raise, but a career federal specialist in the food stamp program would receive an increase of $ 682. And while a politically appointed agency bureau director would receive a $ 39,500 increase, a mid-level manager in the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> system would only receive $ 1,263. The pay proposals in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget are noteworthy for their disparity. There would be 50 percent increases for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, top political appointees and federal judges; 16.5 percent for many junior career executves; 3.6 percent for 2.1 million military personnel, and just 2 percent for the 2.5 million-strong <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> work force. In addition, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has proposed a one-year freeze in cost-of-living adjustments for military and civilian retirees. The 50 percent raises for 2,498 people _ lawmakers, judges and top executive branch personnel _ would go into effect on Feb. 8 unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defeat the proposal. House leaders have indicated there will be no vote in the chamber by the deadline, a non-action that would trigger the top raises automatically. Under the proposal, rank-and-file lawmakers' pay would rise to $ 135,000 from the current $ 89,500. Lawmakers supporting the pay raise have said if the increase goes through, they will give up the right to earn outside income, including speaking fees. Representatives of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers are careful not to oppose the raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, because these same lawmakers must decide later whether to give federal employees more than the 2 percent <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed. But they're not bashful about attacking the administration. `` What outrages me is that the people who are responsible for doing the work are ignored and insulted by the president,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobias </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, representing 145,000 federal workers. `` It's the idea that some elitist group is solely responsible for accomplishing the mission of the federal government.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, president of the largest federal employee union, the 700,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I support the 50 percent. If you listen to some of the rhetoric and look at the folks who have come out against it, those are the same people who will be opposing pay raises for the people I represent.'' `` Taking cheap shots at high-level folks is not going to do anything for the people I represent.'' But <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is `` going out like he came in _ bashing federal employees in his budget proposal.'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said it is incorrect to compare the proposed 50 percent increase at top levels with the 2 percent for civil servants. He said that civil servants have received steady raises each year, and are only three to five percentage points behind inflation since 1969. The salaries of top officials, he said, are down 35-40 percent compared to inflation over the past 20 years. The administration is trying to let them recoup their losses all at once, he said. `` Common sense and logic do n't apply here,'' he commented. `` You reach tough personal choices where you want to send kids to college and cant afford to. This is the only government we've got and it ought to be well managed. We should n't buy executives on the cheap.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON>, spokesman for the government's personnel agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said the president's budget is not the key to determining the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pay scales. More important, he said, is a government report due in August that will compare federal pay scales to those of similar jobs in the private sector. Based on that report, he said, <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> will make a recommendation to the president on a pay raise. Civil servants are paid under the `` general schedule'' -LRB- GS -RRB- scale, which has 18 different pay grades and 10 steps within most grades. The lowest grade, GS 1, begins at $ 10,213 and the highest, GS 18, has a single salary of $ 86,682. There's also a senior executive service for government managers. Some lawmakers believe congressional pay is an issue that must stand on its own. Among them is Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who has been the chief congressional advocate of raising the minimum wage. `` We should judge the -LRB- congressional -RRB- raise on whether it would improve the quality of representation and lead to other reforms in ethical conduct including honoraria,'' the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` I believe members should not have to vote on their own pay raise. If I were required to vote on it, I would vote in favor because I believe the responsibilities of a congressman certainly justify more than we're now paid. `` If a congressman does n't think he's worth the amount recommended, no law says he's got to take it.''

<TEXT>
 With only a few days remaining before he becomes vice president, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has given few clues about how he will carry out his new role, in effect telling Americans to wait and watch. Since the November election, the once-spotlighted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has deliberately kept a low profile while President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained at center stage with personnel and policy pronouncements. Until the end of last week, the former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator eschewed interviews, rebuffing reporters' attempts to learn what specific goals or projects he has in mind for his vice presidential tenure. His standard reply is that he wants to do <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bidding and become a close adviser to the president. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, however, in an interview published Sunday, that he plans `` crusades'' in such areas as education, anti-drug and crime-fighting efforts, that could include personal visits to crime victims, drug users or school dropouts. Both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have said they want to build an easy-access relationship of the type <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with the president once a week and said that was generally the opportunity he used to relay his views and advice. But how much <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might rely on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s advice is an open question. His press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, summed up the situation this way: `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> comes to the job with certain strengths but he also comes to learn and to work hard. It's not like he's 65 years old and has a wealth of experience across the board like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had. On the other hand, he has a certain perspective that I think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> values.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and wants to spend several hours a week on Capitol Hill, working as an administration advocate with his former colleagues. The energetic 41-year-old politician also is expected to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, making the rounds of the speaker circuit, raising money and courting supporters. Although a favorite of conservatives, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he does not intend to be a mouthpiece for their interests with the more moderate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeals to a Republican mainstream constituency beyond those who share his conservative ideology. <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> managed to raise several million dollars for the party through high-roller campaign events after weathering the spate of negative publicity following his nomination. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s focus in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was on national defense, as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and on job issues stemming from his co-authorship of job-training legislation. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent most of the post-election period selecting his staff and meeting privately with officials and interest groups. Aides reject any notion that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team wanted to keep <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> under wraps, but say <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> himself set the low profile during the period when he wanted to establish his relationship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We've been sensitive to not try and handle him,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition communications director <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Demarest </PERSON>. Aides acknowledge that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has an image problem stemming from the post-Republican convention furor over his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service and poor grades in school. Opinion polls have shown that most Americans are doubtful about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s competence to assume the presidency should anything happen to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s image is n't helped by the jokes perpetuated not only by late-night TV comedians, but by fellow Republicans. One was told recently by a close associate of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to issue Quayle bonds, the joke goes. `` There's no principle, no interest and they never mature.'' When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first took office in 1981, he assigned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head a commission on deregulating the government. With that commission's work mostly finished, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> apparently wo n't take on anything similar. In his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially said he would want his vice president to head administration anti-drug efforts, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was edged out of that responsibility by congressional legislation creating a separate cabinet-level `` drug czar'' post. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week named former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to the job.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> pulled a rabbit out of his hat by bringing his proposed 1990 budget in under the Gramm-Rudman law's deficit ceiling, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be wrestling with a larger, less cooperative rabbit when he prepares his own spending plan <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accomplished the trick with a $ 1.15 trillion budget plan that stuck close to his fiscal priorities of the past eight years: domestic spending cuts and higher military expenditures. The new president, however, has outlined a somewhat different set of priorities for how the government should be spending its money. During his election campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke about expanding programs for education, the environment, drug law enforcement, the homeless, needy children, AIDS and federal prisons. He also set goals of carving out tax breaks for child care, oil and gas exploration, and college savings, among other things. In addition, bailouts of failed savings and loan associations could cost as much as $ 100 billion over the next several years, while cleanup and renovation of the nation's crumbling nuclear weapons plants could cost a comparable amount in the coming years. All of this comes when there is very little breathing room in the federal budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must try to submit a budget that finances the government's operations next year without piercing the deficit target of $ 100 billion set by the Gramm-Rudman law. The spending blueprint <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed last Monday would leave an imbalance of $ 92.5 billion. But because the Gramm-Rudman law does not count $ 6 billion worth of proposed asset sales, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plan officially leaves $ 98.6 billion in red ink. Can <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> squeeze his priorities in and still meet the $ 100 billion Gramm-Rudman target _ and keep his campaign pledge of no new taxes? Republicans say he can, although they concede it will take a lot of elbow grease. `` I wo n't say he should have no problems,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` But it's eminently possible.'' Under one scenario, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could address his campaign promises by diverting only small amounts of money at them, saving heavier spending for later years. `` I do n't see a whole lot of room, and that's the bad news,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> budget aide who is now a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The good news is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't asking for a whole lot.'' Democrats, however, are convinced that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not meet the deficit target without new taxes or harsh cuts in spending that will enrage voters. They've spent the first week of this year's tax wars trying to goad the incoming chief executive into showing how he'll do it. In their analysis of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spending plan, Democrats on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to present `` a budget that will squarely face up to the challenges before us.'' Congressional Democrats say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a harder deficit reduction job ahead of him than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admits. The White House's Office of Management and Budget says the deficit would be $ 127 billion without any tax or spending changes at all, necessitating $ 27 billion in savings to reach the target. But the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated the figure at $ 141 billion, leaving a much larger task. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to accept about $ 2 billion less in military spending than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed, leaving the Pentagon with $ 301 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But he's also considered unlikely to accept <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s idea of eliminating next year's cost-of-living increase for retired federal workers _ at a cost of $ 1.8 billion _ and could well decide to ignore other spending cuts advocated by the outgoing president. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director, has visited congressional leaders in recent weeks, apparently providing few details about the decisions the new administration might make. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will address the issue shortly after his inauguration Friday. As the next president likes to say, `` Stay tuned.''

<HEAD>Study: Male Hormones Are Good For Men's Hearts</HEAD>

 Doctors have long recognized the power of female sex hormones to keep women's hearts healthy. Now there's evidence that abundant levels of testosterone may be good for men's `` It's attractive to think that being male is good for men and being female is good for women,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett-Connor </PERSON>, a physician at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Estrogen, the female hormone, is believed to one of the key differences between the sexes that explains why women typically live seven to eight years longer than men. <PERSON> Barrett-Connor </PERSON> presented evidence Monday that men with high levels of testosterone, the male hormone, are in better shape than those with relatively low levels. Whether this means they are more likely to escape heart attacks is still unclear. Her work, presented Monday at a meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is based on a followup of 5,000 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> residents who were first examined in 1972. She found that men with high testosterone also have higher levels of high density lipoprotein, or HDL, the so-called good cholesterol that protects people from heart attacks. They also have lower blood pressure and are less likely to be overweight. `` In other words, testosterone is good for men,'' she said. However, despite these attributes that would seem to lower the risk of heart disease, there was no clear evidence that the men with higher testosterone actually lived longer. <PERSON> Barrett-Connor </PERSON> noted that the body's levels of sex hormones fluctuate throughout the day. And since her research was based on just one blood sample, it might not have accurately identified differences between the men's hormone levels. She also noted that even if testosterone turns out to be good for men's hearts, she does not advocate taking extra doses of the hormone. She said another major study has begun to see what effect estrogen pills have on women's risk of heart attacks after they go through menopause, when their bodies' natural production of the chemical drops sharply. Some of the women will take estrogen alone, while others will get a combination of estrogen and progestin. Estrogen by itself can increase the risk of uterine cancer. But while the estrogen and progestin combination eliminates this hazard, some doctors fear that the extra progestin wipes out estrogen's benefits for the heart. Among other research presented Monday: _ Dr <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said that anger, not impatience, is the key element of Type A behavior that raises the risk of heart disease. He said that those with a heart attack-prone personality are more likely to get angry, to become suspicious of other people's motives and to show their hostility toward others. _ According to Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, panic attacks and depression are frequently mistaken for heart disease, especially among young and middle-aged women During panic attacks, people may gasp for breath, grow dizzy, tremble, feel chest pain and believe they are going to die. _ Strokes occur in two or three of every 100,000 children Dr. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aram </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Babies </ORGANIZATION> and Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> has found that when the stroke is limited to one side of the brain, these youngsters grow to have normal intelligence. However, they may have varying degrees of other problems, including physical weakness on one side and trouble reading and talking. _ Dr <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reported that cocaine use is becoming a major cause of strokes in young adults. Studies at one hospital found it to be the single greatest cause of strokes in those under age 40.

<TEXT>
 A disputed Libyan plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> proves the difficulty of enforcing a treaty banning chemical weapons, say a number of national security experts. A conference of 149 nations, meeting last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, endorsed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to reaffirm a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol against the use and spread of chemical weapons. That declaration will not ban chemical weapons, but was expected to give new impetus to long-stalled negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on a proposal put forward in 1984 by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for banning chemical weapons outright and requiring those nations that have them to destroy their stockpiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who succeeds President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday, has expressed a wish to be remembered as the president under whom chemical weapons are eliminated. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, is among those who say it would be hard to verify compliance with a ban on their production, and even harder to verify their total destruction. `` The problem we have is that nobody has yet determined how to do it in an effectively verifiable way, because chemical weapons can be made in just about any kind of chemical plant,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said in a interview broadcast over the weekend on the syndicated television program, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s One on One.'' `` And you can turn it back into an aspirin plant or a fertilizer plant with a few hours notice,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` It's very troubling.'' The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference gained publicity and momentum because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> was building a chemical weapons plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 35 miles from <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> says the plant would make pharmaceuticals. Two former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats with long experience in chemical weapons negotiations, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Floweree </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, recently disputed <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s pessimistic view, arguing that any factory large enough to make a significant amount of chemical weapons could be detected by American intelligence. `` Clandestine manufacture is difficult to imagine,'' said <PERSON> Floweree </PERSON>, who in 1977-79 directed the international relations division of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of defense in the first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said the dispute over the Libyan plant illustrates the problems of verifying a ban on chemical weapons. `` While the Libyan plant is a dedicated chemical weapon facility, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s protestations that it is a pharmaceutical complex nicely illustrates the problem: essentially any facility that actually is meant for production of civilian chemical products ... has the inherent ability to produce toxic chemical agents for weapons.'' Although about 15 countries are thought to have chemicals weapons, only two nations acknowledge it, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Additionally, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> concluded in 1984 that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in its war against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has announced that his nation would begin destroying stockpiles of chemical weapons, which he and other Soviet officials have said since Dec. 26, 1987, totalled 50,000 tons. But on Dec. 2, 1988, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration challenged those figures. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not disclosed their own estimates, outside experts have cited figures as high as 300,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not produce chemical weapons from 1969 until 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, with the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, began to manufacture binary weapons, which become lethal when two otherwise nontoxic chemicals are combined, forming a lethal charge. The Army is destroying its stocks of old single-substance chemical weapons, and although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have not disclosed the extent of the stockpile, outside experts estimate it to be about 30,000 tons of chemical agents. The chemicals, plus the artillery shells to deliver them, would weigh several times more. Besides the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, more than a dozen other nations are thought to have chemical weapons, said <PERSON> Elisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> who carefully tracks the issue. Those nations able to make their own chemical weapons are thought to be <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and probably <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which is thought to have used the weapons in its war against <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is also thought to have chemical weapons, she said. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and a number of other Soviet-bloc nations are thought to have acquired chemical weapons at some point from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, although that practice appears to have ended, she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is bringing a tidal wave of Texans with him to the capital city, and they promise to make their way of doing things felt on the social as well as political scene. In addition to a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> president _ albeit a transplanted <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> _ a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, appointees from defense secretary-designate to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director, and four committee chairmen in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will have to reckon with their families. `` <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> down the hatches,'' warns <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday's front page. `` Nervy, sexy, filthy rich <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, wife of the incoming <ORGANIZATION> commerce </ORGANIZATION> secretary and a certified social cyclone, is headed our way.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, wife of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, is n't the only sign that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has arrived. `` You'll see more boots than you've seen. You'll see more hats than you've seen,'' says <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. `` And if the emergence of Texans into positions of power brings good Mexican food to the capital, the achievement will be miraculous.'' `` The quality of the barbecue is going to pick up, the quality of the Mexican food is going to pick up,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, a Democrat and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmer. `` The social scene is going to pick up and we'll have a little high culture; the cotton-eyed <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and the two-step are going to be right at the top of the list.'' <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denton </LOCATION>, that despite the influx, the days of the wheeler-dealer, swashbuckling <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicans are gone. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> says he's not convinced <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his coterie of nationalized Texans will wield the same sort of behind-the-scenes clout as <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, vice president and president; as <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> did when he was House Speaker; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> did as <PERSON> Frankin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s vice president. If any Texan has real connections, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> says it's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, who has `` has fought those battles in the corridors of power,'' and may actually be more influential in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at least for now. <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s inaugural chairman 24 years ago, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, is n't expecting any <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> invasion at all, he says, because the state has always had a presence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the 47 years he's been in here `` There's always been a pronounced <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> influence here in town,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says. `` I've known a very strong <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for 47 years.'' But others are expecting a flock of Texans who will leave a Texas-size style imprint on the government. `` Texans are really going to be here in a big way. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will have a big part to play,'' says veteran journalist <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, who predicts less `` gobbledygook'' in government publications because of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> preference for simple and direct language. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> says he thinks the four Cabinet appointments and other high-profile jobs already awarded to Texans are just the tip of the iceberg. `` There will be literally hundreds of Texans in decision-making positions. People tend to hire people they know and people they trust.'' But <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> says: `` A lot of these are cosmetic positions, especially the appointed positions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't have the connections <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> did, and there is just no substitute for on-the-Hill politics in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' Still, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> says it's a `` plus for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` I know all of these Texans care about our state and those who are not Texans know the guy at the top cares about <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and that's obviously going to help,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> says

Several officers and bystanders were hit by rocks and bottles, police said. At least two cars were set afire and two news vehicles attacked with rocks, authorities said. An auto parts store burned after firefighters were shot at and had to leave the area, police said. Four people, including one police officer, were treated for lacerations and minor injuries at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, and released, said spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. Other officers were treated at the scene, police said. `` All of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of the driver. I blocked it with my elbow. They were yelling ` Get that white woman out of the car,''' said <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz-Toledo </PERSON>, a 27-year-old WCIX-TV reporter. Miss Ruiz-Toledo, who had stayed in her car while an anchorman and camerman got out, said she drove a block away and was rescued by an officer who led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield. A waitress said her windshield was shattered by a five-pound concrete block when she drove through the area on her way home from work. `` I had no idea it was going on,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` There were about 20 kids all throwing things. I was worried that I was going to be hurt. I did n't see any cops around there.'' Later Monday, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police were placed on full alert, with overnight shifts called in early, and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Patrol </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> police placed on standby. The incident began about 5:45 p.m. on the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> holiday when police started chasing a motorcycle with two possible robbery suspects, said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. Police started shooting, and the motorcycle ran into a car, <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said. The driver of the motorcycle died at the scene, said police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who would n't say whether the cause was the crash or police gunfire. A motorcycle passenger was hospitalized, along with others in the vehicle involved in the wreck, police said, without giving identities. The 21-year-old dead suspect and his passenger were both black men, said police, who refused to divulge the race of the officers involved in the chase. A crowd of about 50 to 75 people gathered at the accident scene in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section and started throwing rocks and bottles, <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said. By several hours later, he said, the situation had become `` very volatile'' and a riot control plan was put into effect. `` I obviously can assure you we will have a full investigation,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think there's ever been a situatuion where quicker action has been taken by city governance.'' During three days of rioting in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section in 1982, arsonists torched buildings and mobs broke into stores, causing millions of dollars worth of damage. The riot was sparked by the fatal shooting of a black man by a Cuban-born police officer. A police internal affairs report in 1985 concluded that the officer was justified in using deadly force. In 1980, racial violence in adjacent <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> left 18 people dead, 400 injured and $ 100 million in damage. That rioting occurred after an all-white jury acquitted several <LOCATION> Miami-Dade </LOCATION> police officers of manslaughter in the beating death of a black businessman. The latest incident comes as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is trying to polish its image for an influx of visitors for the Super Bowl on Sunday. The scene of the disturbance was at least 10 miles from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON> in north <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the site of the Super Bowl. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> are staying less than a mile away at the Omni Hotel. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has a game scheduled Tuesday, is on the edge of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>.

 An air historian says he has unearthed evidence suggesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviator <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> ran out of fuel and crashed about 30 miles short of a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island on her round-the-world flight a half-century ago. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> air force navigator, said Monday he discovered a letter <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> wrote to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s aviation authority saying she intended to carry 1,000 gallons of fuel aboard her <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electra </ORGANIZATION> on the flight over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, some of which crossed over British <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> territory. He said <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s navigator, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, also was reported by The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, as saying the twin-engine plane would be loaded with 950 gallons for the flight from <LOCATION> Lae </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a speck of land in the central <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The record-setting pilot never arrived on <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, disappearing near the end of a 2,550-mile flight over water on July 2, 1937. No trace of the plane or its pilot and navigator were found, and theories about their fate have since abounded, including one that <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> landed on another island, was imprisoned by the Japanese and was executed as a spy. `` With 950 gallons, they could have made it, just,'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON>, 67, said in a telephone interview. `` But, unfortunately, she experienced relatively strong head winds on the flight and her safety margin evaporated. So she must have come down in the sea.'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON>, whose research was published in the February edition of <ORGANIZATION> Aeroplane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, calculated that <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> was flying about 35 miles west or northwest of <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when her last, frantic message that she was about to crash was received by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast guard cutter, <LOCATION> Itasca </LOCATION>, 20 hours and 20 minutes after takeoff. `` It is evident she must have come down in the sea a few minutes later, when she believed she was nowhere near <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> says other researchers have suggested <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> landed on the Japanese-controlled <PERSON> Mili </PERSON> <PERSON> Atoll </PERSON> 23 hours and 10 minutes after takeoff, having turned back after failing to find <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` This suggests the flight duration was the maximum possible if the <LOCATION> Electra </LOCATION> had been fueled to capacity,'' he wrote. The aircraft, converted from a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> airliner, had a fuel capacity of 1,150 gallons, he said, but in a Feb. 13, 1937, letter to the director of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> wrote that she intended to carry `` probably 1,000 gallons of gasoline'' on her longest flight over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said he found the original letter written by <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> on her headed notepaper and bearing her signature in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. He said that according to fuel consumption figures supplied to him by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, 950 gallons would have given the twin-engine plane an endurance of 20 hours and 13 minutes. In her final message, <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> said she was flying north and south on a line but did not give a reference point. `` This sounds as though <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> was chasing shadows on the surface of the sea, formed by the cumulus clouds above, or was flying toward more distant clouds in the hope that these were the smoke which the <LOCATION> Itasca </LOCATION> was making,'' <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> wrote. He dismissed the notion that she was on a mission to photograph the Japanese-held island of <LOCATION> Truk </LOCATION>, saying she would have crossed it at night, and night-photography equipment had not yet been perfected. He also wrote that contrary to the belief at the time that her plane would float, the metal aircraft was likely to have sunk immediately.

<HEAD>Stuttering Linked To Brain Flaws By High-Tech Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Stuttering, once thought to be psychological, has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists who hope to understand many disorders by making 3-D videotapes of the brain in action. Subtle irregularities in electrical activity and blood flow were found in brains of 60 percent of stutterers, whose speech is broken by abnormal pauses, repetitions -LRB- st-st-stuttering -RRB- or prolongations -LRB- ssssstuttering -RRB- of sounds, said audiologist <PERSON> Terese </PERSON> <PERSON> Finitzo </PERSON>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> studies. She said similar brain abnormalities were detected in 84 percent of people with spasmodic dysphonia, in which malfunctioning vocal cords produce a hoarse, strained, strangled-sounding voice. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> scientists studied 20 stutterers and 77 people with spasmodic dysphonia by examining magnetic resonance imaging pictures of brain anatomy. Unlike CAT scans, which use X-rays, the technique uses a giant magnet and radio waves to make pictures of organs. The scientists also made maps of brain electrical activity as measured by electrodes on the head; and images of brain blood flow. But they also developed a way to process the two-dimensional maps of brain electrical activity to pinpoint the location of that activity. That let them superimpose the brain anatomy and electrical activity images, then string them together on videotape to make `` an animated movie or cartoon, so as electrical activity progresses you can see it moving through the brain'' in three dimensions, said Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pool </PERSON>, a neurologist in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> group. Blood-flow images will be added later. Such technology might help scientists understand how the brain works, and perhaps eventually how to better diagnose and treat speech defects, mental illness, epilepsy, dyslexia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, post-stroke speech loss and other disorders, <PERSON> Pool </PERSON> said. The technique `` is expected to radically alter -LRB- brain -RRB- disease evaluation and management for neurologists, psychiatrists and neurosurgeons,'' said a news release from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Scientists have long believed that the speech impediments were psychological. But in recent years, many have linked the impediments to brain malfunctions that can be aggravated by psychological stress. That view is supported by findings of the government-funded, $ 2 million <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> research outlined by <PERSON> Finitzo </PERSON>, Pool and colleagues Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The studies also suggest the speech defects have many causes, because not all the patients had brain abnormalities, <PERSON> Pool </PERSON> said. About 1 percent of Americans stutter to some degree. Spasmodic dysphonia is uncommon, although there are no reliable estimates, <PERSON> Finitzo </PERSON> said. Stutterers and people with spasmodic dysphonia often receive speech therapy to learn to slow down, breathe differently or otherwise alter their speaking habits, but for many `` the benefits are minimal,'' Pool said. He said patients are relieved when told their stuttering or spasmodic dysphonia is physical. `` We've had people say, ` Thank God it's not my fault.' They do n't have to feel responsible for it, -LRB- even -RRB- if everybody's telling them, ` If you just relax you can speak better,''' he said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, head of speech pathology at the <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said there are several forms of the speech defects and that people whose stuttering is psychological may get improper treatment if they believe otherwise. <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> questioned the reliability of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> team's methods, saying they were biased by preconceptions and studied too few patients. He also accused them of making conclusions `` far beyond what the facts imply'' and of failing to conduct adequate psychiatric exams of their patients. But he did say `` there is great merit in what they are doing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> speech scientist <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniloff </PERSON> agreed more people should be studied, but said he reviewed much of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> research for the government and concluded `` the data are good. ... The methodology is sound.'' `` I think it's good work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> speech scientist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON>. `` They are probably the only people in the world using a combination of new brain-imaging techniques to investigate stuttering.'' Pool and <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> agreed the brain abnormalities are n't necessarily the direct cause of stuttering and spasmodic dysphonia, and that the abnormalities and speech defects could result from some other ultimate cause But because the abnormalities are in parts of the brain believed to control speech, the Texans believe the abnormalities cause the impediments _ even if they ultimately might be caused by a chemical flaw in the brain, a gene, injury, tiny strokes or even pollutants, Pool said.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges In Japan; Stocks Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar surged against the Japanese yen Tuesday, while investors reacted to the weaker yen by pushing share prices lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar eased in the afternoon to close at 127.70 yen, up 1.05 yen from Friday's close of 126.65 yen, after opening at 127.93 yen and surging to peak at 128.15 yen in early morning trading. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues dipped 70.86 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 31,227.52. Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> attributed the dollar's strength to the difference in key interest rates between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and to reported statements by West German monetary authorities that the dollar's current level is acceptable. <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> will not intervene to stem the dollar's rise because `` the situation does not require imediate countermeasures.'' Currency traders said the dollar's remarkable strength against the yen followed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's bullish advance in overseas markets overnight. The dollar closed Monday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 128.05 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 128.10 yen. Traders said the dollar also was strong because of reduced chances for central bank intervention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> due to national holidays. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> traders were absent from the market Monday in observance of Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday, while Japanese banks and government offices were also closed Monday in observance of the Coming of Age Day. `` There were strong demands for buying the dollar, but traders' fear over intervention prevented such a move,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity `` Then when they were freed from such a fear, they all went out to buy the dollar.'' But the traders added that the dollar's gain is unlikely to continue ahead of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reports due Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, dealers said the dollar's steep gain sidelined many investors. `` The market seems to be taking a break -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- because of unstable currency rates,'' said a dealer at a major brokerage house in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But the underflow of the market is still bullish.''

 A man whose wife was killed and daughter injured in a mudslide that left their car dangling on the edge of a 100-foot cliff said he was `` just driving along and the whole mountain came down on top of us.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 27, who suffered minor injuries in Sunday's accident, said the family was on a logging road and looking at snow when their car was crushed by a 20-foot boulder freed by the mudslide `` It happened so quick,'' he said. The impact of the boulder trapped the car on the steep, muddy hillside above the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was freed shortly after the accident. His wife, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. Rescuers spent seven hours working to free the <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON> They used rocks and an air bag to brace other boulders, and firefighters with safety ropes and life jackets hung over the cliff's edge to work on the car with hydraulic equipment, said firefighter <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownlee </PERSON>. `` When we got there, all we could see was her -LRB- <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON>'s -RRB- face,'' he said. `` That's how bad it was. `` The situation was if you cut one thing and pried it up, you could n't see where the rest of the body was.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a medic with <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION>, was able to crawl inside the car with the girl, but could do little more than treat a gash on her head, talk to her and administer oxygen. `` She was pretty scared,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There were times she said she hurt all over. And other times she said she felt nothing all over.'' `` She'd say, ` I want my Dad or I'm going to scream, and I said, ` If you're going to scream, I'll scream too.' That quieted her down,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The girl rarely mentioned her mother, who lay dead in the car with her, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Her father was able to get within 10 feet of the car and yell encouragement, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> added. The child was listed in fair condition Monday at <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she underwent surgery for a broken leg. `` It's almost impossible to believe anybody survived,'' said sheriff's deputy <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholaus </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to plan his father's funeral. Now other relatives must plan funerals for the son and two other family members who authorities say died from fumes from the same faulty furnace. `` It was a tremendous and gross loss of lives,'' <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jentzen </PERSON> said Monday. `` I think it makes everyone humble to see this type of disaster happen.'' After the 89-year-old <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> died Wednesday, autopsy results revealed extensive heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver. The death was attributed to natural causes, and no toxicological exams were believed necessary, <PERSON> Jentzen </PERSON> said. `` There's not a medical examiner's office in this country that would have handled this case any differently,'' he said. As relatives gathered for the funeral, they stayed at his suburban <LOCATION> Greendale </LOCATION> home. Sunday morning, his niece, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, called police when she telephoned the home and got no answer. An officer knocked on the door but got no response. Hours later, Mrs. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> called police back to say she had found the three bodies in the house. `` My wife could have been there, too,'' her husband, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, said Monday evening from their <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> home. `` She was supposed to pick them up. Then the others said they would do it. They were going to pick them up at the airport and then stay at the house.'' <PERSON> Jentzen </PERSON> confirmed Monday that carbon monoxide poisoning killed <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s 37-year-old niece, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marshfield </LOCATION> and her husband <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 38 <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, 56, was in critical condition Monday night after treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, according to a nursing supervisor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jentzen </PERSON> said further tests on the elder <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON>'s body showed he too died of carbon monoxide poisoning. `` This was a very rare and unusual case because of the circumstances and the loss of lives,'' <PERSON> Jentzen </PERSON> said. After the bodies were discovered, investigators found the gas furnace's regulator was not properly adjusted, causing too much gas to go into the furnace, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Markovina </PERSON> said. The overburning caused incomplete combustion that filled the house with carbon monoxide, a colorless, oderless and lethal gas, he said. The coroner's report said five burners in the furnace were clogged, causing improper burning, although <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the unit had annual inspections. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> also said the senior <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> was a machinist and worked as a supervisor at a factory before he retired. The home was built as part of the original <LOCATION> Greendale </LOCATION> development, part of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>'s Green Belt program of the 1930s, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, said his father was an elementary school teacher but had retired last month and hoped to spend time golfing, woodworking and traveling. He said his father, who grew up in the house where he died, moved to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> in 1971 with his wife and four children, and they became citizens of that country. `` At the time, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was bringing teachers over ... and my father was looking at a new place to teach, and he thought it would be a good change, so we came across,'' <PERSON> Zarnow </PERSON>, 29, said from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said seven relatives planned to arrive today from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` This is so stupefying on the surface,'' he said. `` Thankfully, there's been so much activity -LRB- at his home -RRB- that it's distracted my wife.'' Friends had stopped by, bringing food for the family and `` talking about other things,'' he said. `` It helps keep the ball rolling.''

 The Western Shoshone Indians have vowed to press their claim to full grazing rights on a half-million acres of land despite an appeals court ruling limiting the number of horses and cows they can have. `` This is n't the end to litigation.

The appellate ruling limits the <ORGANIZATION> Danns </ORGANIZATION> to grazing 26 cows and 79 horses, the number their parents had on the land when the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act took effect. The sisters currently have 768 cows and 850 horses. A tearful <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday she has no plans to reduce the herd. `` I'm not really afraid of going to jail because I believe I'm right,'' she said The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sued the <ORGANIZATION> Danns </ORGANIZATION> for trespassing in 1974 to prevent them from using the land for grazing. The 14-year-old case has been argued three times in federal court in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, twice in the appeals court and once before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The sisters claim that an 1863 treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives them the right to use the land for grazing. The government contends that the Western Shoshone lost its ancestral land in 1979 when the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> awarded the tribe $ 26 million for the acreage. The Indians have refused to accept the money. `` This land was never given by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to us. It is the Creator's land,'' <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> said Monday. `` The Creator put us on this land,'' she said. We were not placed here by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government. Our livelihood is tied to this land. They wanted to do away with our livelihood. They're trying to destroy our beliefs, our culture.'' <PERSON> Luebben </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said he would continue to argue the case in federal court, but added he would try other avenues. `` Considering this decision by the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Shoshone </LOCATION> people are going to have to appeal to the public and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Luebben </PERSON> said. `` We consider this decision to be wrong and extremely unjust,'' he said. `` There is still institutional racism in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 Five former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines stood at what was their military base two decades ago. Surrounded by unexploded shells, they unfurled the stars and stripes and prayed and wept for their fallen comrades. While <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, a 41-year-old farmer from <LOCATION> Langdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, prayed for help to `` deal with the memories, the pain and the loneliness,'' poor women and children with hoes hacked away at the reddish dirt, trying to uncover the casings of shells for scrap metal. They said that two weeks ago an old man was killed when an uncovered shell exploded, and that such shells had killed many others, including children. A Vietnamese captain, <PERSON> Hoang </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON>, stood with the Americans at the ceremony just south of what was once the Demilitarized Zone that divided <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> at the 17th parallel. He verified that mines and other unexploded artillery and mortar shells were still killing and wounding civilians. The former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> had suspected that civilians were still being killed and wounded by unexploded shells and land mines that their engineer battalion, the 11th Marines, planted to protect a string of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases just below the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s. The men, who came back to check claims by Vietnamese officials that all of the mines had been cleared, were shocked to see the children picking at the shellings at the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> artillery base at <LOCATION> Gio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linh </LOCATION>. `` I feel outrage,'' said <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, a 41-year-old maintenance worker from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as he looked out over the children. `` This whole place should be quarantined, fenced up; only professional people, not children. Look at them.'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said: `` My legs are walking but my mind is not wanting to do this because for so long I spent time in this place watching people get killed.'' `` It's peaceful, but I'm real nervous,'' he said. `` I've got to admit I could hardly get out of the van to come up here. I'm scared to death, the time I was here we was under attack and that's the only memories I have of here. `` Even though it's in peace, its still looks awfully threatening to me.'' In the salute to the dead, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, a 39-year-old police lieutenant from <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said, `` On behalf of the men that lost their lives and women in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during the conflict, we present this small ceremony, some token of appreciation in the lives that they gave. For those who did not return, eternal rest. For those who did return, gratitude and peace.'' Everywhere the former marines went, they were greeted warmly as they retraced their steps northward along Highway 1 where they once swept the road for land mines. Children followed them along the route and the Americans stopped to snap photos. `` This is the first time I've felt we're performing our mission since I've been here,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` This is for the people.'' `` This is where it all began,'' said fireman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, 40, from <LOCATION> Stoughton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` This is where we grew up. This is where we became men 20 years ago.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said minority students are getting an inferior education because of a lack of minority teachers. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> on Monday called the shortage a matter of `` true urgency,'' pointing out that 30 percent of the nation's students are minorities, while only 13 percent of the educators are. `` Today, the person that takes roll ... and assigns work ... is usually an Anglo teacher, doing the best he can do,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said in the keynote address to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruitment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the eyes of some minority students, knowledge and education are equated with whites, and perhaps ... minority students believe education belongs to one group or another,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said earlier Monday that the minority student population is expected to increase in the 1990s as the number of minority teachers in public schools drops to 3 percent. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said a shortage of minority teachers will threaten the system because it deprives minority students of positive role models and `` creates an educational deficit'' for whites because it gives `` them a distorted view of the world ... and valuable contact with teachers who offer dramatic proof that adversity can be overcome and that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream is not a myth.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said more minority teachers must be recruited, and that recruitment must begin in elementary schools by encouraging minorities in academia. He also said parents should work with and encourage their children during the pre-school years. `` If we educators made it a top priority to enlist the aid of parents, think what a difference it would make,'' he said. `` We must help all parents create a home environment that supports achievement and learning. Too often in low-income homes, education is undervalued.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> noted an anthropological study that found students at a predominantly black <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, high school were limiting their academic success `` so their peers wo n't think they are acting white.'' The teachers union president said educators `` have to do something to ensure that our children do n't think this way,'' and said schools should `` develop courses and programs aimed at helping build self-esteem.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said students must be told, `` It's OK to be smart, to use your abilities and excel.''

 A woman who shot and killed a friend of her family was married in a private courthouse ceremony just hours after she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter. `` This has turned the worst day of my life ... into the most wonderful day of my life,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scifres </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubba </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a 30-year employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Scifres </PERSON>, 35, was sentenced Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Bartholomew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the August 1987 killing of 63-year-old <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Cope </PERSON>, a drifter and ex-convict who was befriended several years earlier by <PERSON> Scifres </PERSON>' Deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemeier </PERSON> maintained <PERSON> Scifres </PERSON> shot Cope at point-blank range after a heated argument over a gasoline spill at her tavern, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>'s Lounge.

<TEXT>
 In a cost-cutting move, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has directed that a fewer peacekeepers than originally planned should monitor <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The council, in unanimously approving the peacekeeping force on Monday, asked Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to identify `` possible tangible cost-saving measures'' to the mission. `` There's going to be a considerable reduction in money,'' Gen. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, told reporters after the vote. He said helicopters and sensors can monitor an area better that `` soldiers just standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the ground.'' Black-ruled nations of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> had lobbied to deploy the 7,500 peacekeepers, at least 360 military police and 2,000 civilian administrators under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices _ at a cost of about $ 800 million a year. But the council's five permanent members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ want to hold the cost to between $ 400 million and $ 500 million, diplomats said on condition of anonymity. The council must now determine the strength of peacekeeping forces and cost of their deployment under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan whereby the territory also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> will become independent after elections in November. In its resolution, the council asked <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to prepare a report estimating the size and needs of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group. When the report is ready, probably in about two weeks, the council will vote on formally creating the force. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is to gain independence under peace accords signed Dec. 22 by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that also stipulate that 50,000 Cuban troops in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will leave by July 1991. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has suggested cutting the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force from 7,500 to 3,200 because fighting has stopped between South African forces of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> captured <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I, and the League of Nations gave it a mandate for the mineral-rich territory. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> revoked the mandate in 1966 but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> refused to leave.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying he's bitter about former White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s `` kiss and tell'' book, has disclosed that he quietly prepared for his former aide's departure for months before he left. The president, in an interview broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, insisted, `` There was no firing at all.'' However, the president added that he planned to use a letter of resignation <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had submitted months before. `` I set out at the same time, then, to start quietly, and hoping, leakproof, to have a successor on hand for when he announced the time he was going to go,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged in the interview that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had been having problems with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the first lady, and that one of his weaknesses as president is that `` I know that I have a soft heart.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, who had been <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and then-White House chief of staff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the president they wanted to switch jobs in early 1985, and he approved the request. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> left at the end of February 1987, at the height of the Iran-Contra scandal, and was replaced by former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Tenn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insisted at the time he did not fire <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had indicated at some earlier time he wanted to return to private business In the Monday night interview, however, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he quietly hoped to be able use a letter of resignation which <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had submitted months earlier when the chief of staff indicated he would not likely serve through <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s entire second term. `` There was one of those leaks that seems to be so prevalent in this institution,'' the president said. `` And it leaked publicly. And I guess he felt insulted.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was infuriated when there were premature news reports of his resignation, coupled with reports of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s selection. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, at one point, asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s interview statement that allowing <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> to become chief of staff had been her father's biggest mistake. `` I saw that. Happened to be watching television and saw that,'' he replied. Asked if he disagreed with her statement, the president said, `` No, I said, ` That's my girl.''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he is bitter about <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s book, `` For The Record,'' in which the former chief of staff harshly criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s executive management style and also maintained that first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> played a heavy hand in White House affairs `` I was very displeased with that, and yes, it hurt,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` None of the attack was leveled at me _ only at her. And she did n't deserve it anyway.'' `` ... If I can use some rather rough language, I've had a belly full of these kiss-and-tell books, and so many of them that avoid criticizing me, but lay into <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' he said. In a separate <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> interview, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked to describe <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reaction to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s comments in the book about the first lady. `` He was upset,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. She added the president also `` did n't like it'' when she told him that his chief of staff had hung up on her twice. `` He did n't know about the hanging up the first time, because I did n't tell him,'' she said. `` The second time, I told him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> `` did n't tell the truth'' in his book and said that she intended to `` tell everything _ everything the way it really happened'' in her memoirs, due to be published later this year. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also was asked about reports that his administration had recently considered attacking a Libyan plant that is believed to be producing chemical weapons. `` I never like to talk about what the options might be that are considered in anything of that kind ... And no, we had _ we were not planning such an option,'' the president said.

 The chief executive of the country's largest commercial bank, who has long worked to end apartheid, is leaving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to take a job with a European firm, the bank announced. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, 49, was one of several prominent South African businessmen who flew to <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, in 1985 for talks with leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging a bombing and sabotage campaign to overthrow the white minority government. Another member of the business delegation, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, emigrated to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> a year ago, quitting his job as chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate. Ball, who has maintained open contacts with militant black leaders, said he was going abroad for `` personal and societal reasons.'' `` You know what my views are. You can look them up all over the place.'' he told Business Day, a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, formerly Barclays of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, said Monday that <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s resignation was effective immediately. Details of his new job were not immediately disclosed, pending an announcement by his new employers. In 1987, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> became entangled in a bitter confrontation with President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in connection with newspaper advertisements that called for ending the ban on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. Speaking in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> had funded the newspaper ads. Ball challenged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to repeat the remark outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where he would not have immunity from prosecution for slander. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> subsequently appointed a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge to conduct an inquiry in the matter. The judge concluded that <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> had lied when he denied knowing that a loan he had approved would be used to pay for the advertisement. Business Day, in an editorial today, said both Ball and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> `` took up advance positions as opponents of apartheid.'' `` The corporate executive who gets too far ahead of the crowd runs some severe risks, not the least of which may be disillusionment and personal exhaustion,'' it said. `` Fighting apartheid can be a lonely business.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1973 and became managing director in 1984. In 1987, the bank's parent company in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sold its shares, and the South African management changed the bank's name to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will begin its unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in April, a senior Soviet defense official was quoted as saying. Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabanov </PERSON> said the withdrawal announced last month by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will occur in two phases, Austrian Television's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent reported Monday. The first phase will be completed this year, the second in 1990, <PERSON> Shabanov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We assume it will begin in the coming April,'' he said. In a Dec. 7 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks would be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as part of a worldwide cut in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of 500,000 troops _ nearly 10 percent of its more than 5 million personnel. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was quoted as telling a Japanese newspaper last week that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from his country would begin within weeks, but fixed no date. That country's defense minister, <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON>, declined in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to set a date for the withdrawal of some of the estimated 62,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Monday, Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomakin </PERSON> announced that one Soviet division _ roughy 12,000 troops _ would soon be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. An estimated 80,000 Soviet troops are stationed in the country. According to the Czechoslovak state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lomakin </PERSON> said further troop withdrawals depend `` on the attitude of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and the development of the international situation.'' There are an estimated 40,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and about 400,000 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> contends the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> has the advantage in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by virtue largely of its larger air and tank forces. On Saturday, the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations and seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies signed a mandate for new arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for reducing conventional troops and weapons across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement of a partial pullout from the East bloc was intended to give impetus to the new talks, which are due to begin in March. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which has the East bloc's largest per capita foreign debt of $ 17 billion, has said it will cut defense spending by 17 percent this year. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has also announced plans to trim its military spending.

 January usually means harsh winds, bone-chilling temperatures and lots of snow, but not this year. From the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, snowfall has been below normal and temperatures have been above normal. `` Looking at the weather map and temperatures across the nation ... one would never realize that it is the middle of January,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement Monday night after the mercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country. Temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s. The relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists, joggers and municipal budgets but a bane for snowmobile dealers, winter festival organizers and some ski resort operators. `` We've really had to scrap with nature to get every bit of snow this year,'' <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Brodie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Resort </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which reluctantly `` loaned'' <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, snow for its winter festival last weekend. Meteorologists say climatic conditions, such as upper-atmosphere winds, have n't encouraged the kind of storms that leave a heavy snow cover. `` It's pretty free of snow from the southern and central Plains to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said today. `` They have quite a bit of snow across the Northern Tier, but it's remaining up there.'' Much of the area from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, was as brown and bare Monday as it was last summer. Even in the region's far northern snow belt, snowfall has been far below normal As of Monday, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, had received a paltry 4.2 inches of snow this winter, compared with a normal 30.2 inches. <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ often the butt of snow jokes _ has received just 16 inches, 30 inches below normal. `` We're enjoying the weather right now,'' said <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> streets commissioner <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buczkowski </PERSON>. `` But we're not going to kid ourselves. We know we've got two months of winter left, and we're going to get some snow. In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> received just 1.3 inches last month, the seventh lowest December total in 102 years. Large areas of the state had no snow at all. Temperatures averaged 25.9 degrees, 1.6 degrees above normal, and on Dec. 2 <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Indianola </LOCATION> basked in balmy 65-degree weather. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> normally has had 16 inches of snow by now, but only 6 inches have fallen. Temperatures have been 6 to 8 degrees higher than the normal 29 degrees. `` The 30-day outlook calls for continued mild weather, with temperatures averaging about 60 to 65 percent above normal,'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of the weather service said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In some sections of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> hit hard by last summer's drought and heat wave, the low snowfall is not expected to hurt the replenishment of depleted water supplies, officials said. However, a lack of snow cover can cause wind erosion, they said. In the West, winter has been more familiar. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, for example, has had an average snow year, with ski resorts reporting bases of 30 inches to 86 inches. While Western ski resorts have had little to worry about, some cross-country ski resorts in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> have had to close, officials said. Some Eastern downhill ski resorts stayed in business by putting snow-making equipment to use, but others said bare ground in major cities has made it tough to persuade would-be schussers to head for the slopes. Cross-country races at festivals in several <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> communities have been canceled. Many of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> festivals, which bring in $ 5 million to $ 10 million annually, do n't start until late this month or early February, but organizers are worried. <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, where Winterfest begins Jan. 27 and which normally gets 109.9 inches of snow, is barren. The weather has also put the brakes on snowmobile sales. In <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, preseason sales were healthy but `` after December it just fell flat on its face,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who said fellow dealers reported it was the worst season since 1980. But for those who miss the snow, there's always the chance of a change in the weather. `` It can turn around in such a hurry that people may not be talking about lack of snow before long,'' weather service meteorologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We could see a lot of snow in a hurry.''

 The engineers of two trains that crashed head-on in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s deadliest rail accident said today that they both had received clearance to continue their journey on the same track. Railway officials said at least 114 people died when a 10-car express train and a mail train slammed into each other Sunday outside the farming village of <LOCATION> Maizdi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khan </LOCATION>, about 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital. As many as 1,000 people were injured. The government was investigating whether operators using a sophisticated signaling system installed five days before the crash gave the wrong signal or no signal. The engineer of the mail train, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, said the signal at a nearby railway station was not working, but he received written clearance from the stationmaster to proceed. `` I suddenly saw another train coming from the opposite direction on the same track,'' he said. `` I blew the emergency horn several times to draw the attention of the driver of the other train,'' <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his hospital bed. The driver of the express train, <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, also said he had clearance and continued to drive at normal speed, about 50 mph. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said he left the railway station after he was given a yellow signal, which meant that the track ahead was clear. The investigative commission has seized documents from the two railway stations and started interviewing witnesses and railway officials in an effort to determine the cause of the accident. The government today said the death toll was 77, but its count generally is considered low because of bureaucratic delays. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers said as many as 200 people had died. Officials estimated that more than 2,000 people were aboard the trains, many of them Moslem pilgrims. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the city of <LOCATION> Tongi </LOCATION> for the Biswa Ejtema, or world congregation, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s second largest pilgrimage after the Haj in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was looking for a better understanding of the black rage that descended upon <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on the day that honors the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The Cuban-born city commissioner found her answers early today on a dark corner of 20th St. and NW 3rd Ave., in the heart of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Guy's Auto Parts had burned to a shell. A torched car was turned on its side. The riot started after by a motorcyclist's death Monday night. At least two officers were pursuing the motorcycle for an alleged traffic violation. One of the officers fired a shot, the motorcycle crashed into a moving car, killing the cycle's 21-year-old driver, police said. Police refused to say whether he was hit by the bullet. Wary police in riot gear kept automatic rifles poised, occasionally dropping the barrel toward any rapid movement. On the corner was a group of about 15 young black men: angry, nervous _ watching every police move. The 43-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, just over 5 feet tall in her pumps and wearing a bright red pants and top, walked over. What caused this to happen? she asked. `` How can a person shoot a guy riding a motorcycle?'' replied one man, who would not identify himself. `` Do something about the ones that got the guns.'' As his voice rose, the others lost their shyness. The crowd began to grow. A young shirtless teen-ager stepped forward. `` The blacks have been here since I do n't know when,'' he said. `` But 10,000 Cubans a year ... they get jobs just like that. And now the Nicaraguans ... `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officials have been providing shelter at a stadium for about 250 Nicaraguans seeking political asylum. A stone clattered to the pavement and several police rifles leveled at the crowd. `` Do n't you murder him,'' came a cry from another teen. `` We're coming to your homes if there's another murder. As the anger grew, police quietly urged Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> into a waiting car. During the ride through the streets of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> with two officers and a reporter, Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> got the scare of the night when her car approached a group of heavily armed policeman. The police dropped behind the car doors and leveled pistols directly at Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the driver, Officer <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carvil </PERSON> placed the blue police light on the dash and the pistols dropped. Gunfire crackled in the early morning hours amid the housing projects, and officers shouted reports of `` Molotov cocktails.'' One Latin man living in a project with his wife was reportedly beaten on his front porch, officers said. Mrs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other city leaders had hoped this week's Super Bowl would polish up the image of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a one-time tropical paradise, tarnished by race riots in 1980 and 1982, the flood of refugees from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1980 and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> drug wars throughout the decade. But she admitted the opportunity was fast slipping away. `` It's extremely unfortunate that it's happening now,'' she said. And she found more anger than she'd expected. `` I was surprised by the depth of anger,'' she said. `` We'll be talking to community leaders later today.''

 New studies on Type A behavior indicate that being an impatient workaholic does n't necessarily hurt your heart, but distrusting others and having a low boiling point does. The term `` Type A'' probably has outlived its usefulness, and people should concentrate on understanding anger's poisonous effects on the heart, Dr. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said at a meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Being a workaholic, being in a hurry, interrupting people, are not necessarily bad for your heart,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Monday. `` What is bad is if you have high levels of hostility and anger, and you do n't bother to hide it when dealing with other people.'' Experts for many years had thought classic Type A's _ aggressive, rush-rush people _ were setting themselves up for heart attacks. `` Many of us had thought that the definition of Type A was too broad,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>. `` Dr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is narrowing it down.'' In a study to be published soon in Psychosomatic Medicine, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and colleagues described a follow-up study of 118 students who took a personality test during law school. Twenty-five years later, 20 percent of those who scored in the highest quarter on the hostility scale had died, compared with 5 percent of those who scored lowest. The research showed that being paranoid or neurotic or avoiding social contact were not associated with heart attacks. Instead, those at high risk tend to harbor a cynical mistrust of other people's motives. They get angry often and openly express their displeasure, rather than holding it in. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said this makeup could be a problem for perhaps 20 percent of the population, and they probably have these tendencies from birth. Such people tend to get furious, for instance, in slow-moving bank lines. They complain to themselves about why other customers have n't filled out their deposit slips ahead of time and may show their unhappiness by making sour faces or even surly comments to those ahead of them. `` I'm not talking about anxiety waiting in line,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` I'm talking about anger.'' There is no evidence to support the common belief that people are better off expressing their anger rather than keeping it to themselves, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Whether people can help themselves by trying to control their feelings of rage is still not clear, but <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that such attempts at behavior change are harmless and may help. Researchers also are starting to understand the biological differences between angry people and calmer folks that may explain why they have more heart trouble. In behavior laboratories, researchers have measured people's blood pressures while asking them to solve word puzzles They found that angry people's blood pressures shoot up dramatically if they are deliberately harassed during the experiments, while the blood pressures of people with cooler temperaments stay normal. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said other evidence points to basic differences in people's nervous systems, depending on whether they have hostile personalities. The work suggests that the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the temper-pumping effects of adrenalin, is slow to kick in among anger-prone people. `` Perhaps trusting hearts last longer because they are protected by the parasympathetic nervous system against the ravages of the -LRB- adrenalin-producing -RRB- sympathetic system,'' said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

 Ringing bells and ringing speeches commemorated the legacy of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> amid renewed calls to strive for the goals of the slain civil rights leader. Marchers filled city streets in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciso </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was symbolically tapped, and national leaders descended on <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s hometown to join his family in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on the federal day marking his 60th birthday. `` He lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's dreams,'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told black leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` He left a hero's indelible mark on the mind and imagination of a great nation.'' A unity march across the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> campus in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> drew about 2,000 people, who paraded as the university's carillon played `` We Shall Overcome,'' the anthem of the civil rights movement Later Monday, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> audience that, `` The world King left is not a great deal different.'' `` But there seems to be an awareness that violence is not the solution to the world's problems, as we learned in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> have learned in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has learned.'' Nowhere was King's influence felt more strongly than in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where he began the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march that helped establish voting rights for blacks throughout the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. On Monday, three blacks were sworn in as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>. They became the first black <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners since Reconstruction and gave the five-member commission a black majority. `` We bring home to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> the harvest of the Martin Luther King voting rights act,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, the first black federal judge in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, who administered the oath of office. King's widow, <PERSON> Corretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, was joined by black and white political leaders for the annual ecumenical service at the <LOCATION> Ebenezer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> King </PERSON> and his father preached. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, once one of King's young lieutenants, used the occasion to criticize the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's civil rights record and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s suggestion that civil rights leaders bolster their position by fostering an attitude of oppression among blacks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s statements `` petty comments from the same man who implied that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was a communist.'' In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, who is black, marked the holiday by unveiling a bronze bust of King that will sit in a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassay compound. The ceremony included blacks and whites who have been prominent critics of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial separation In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, parades were held in places like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where 15,000 people marching from four directions converged on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Plaza `` I took part because Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s dream has not been fully realized,'' said <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Winbush </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who joined 10,000 others in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> parade with his three daughters. King would have been 60 on Sunday. He was 39 years old when he was shot to death by a sniper in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on April 4, 1968. King's birthday was first celebrated as a national holiday in 1986, three years after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> named the third Monday in January as a holiday in his honor. All but six states have adopted the day as a state holiday. The six states are <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, when black leaders symbolically struck the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> as a signal for bells to ring nationwide, Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> cited the bell's famous crack. `` That crack is a symbol that there are some things unfulfilled,'' <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said. At the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, children struck the state's replica of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> `` He was a great man and he believed in what he was doing. He tried to bring peace between all kinds of people,'' said <PERSON> Sharonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardenhire </PERSON>, 10, of <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, shortly after she gave the rope a tug. A speech by one of King's sons in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, was delayed for about an hour after two telephoned bomb threats. The observance resumed after the building was search and no bomb was found. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said that in the 21 years since his father was assassinated `` this nation has made great strides.'' But he added that, `` I've got news for you. We've still got a long way to do.''

 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s battles for voting rights were remembered as the first black county commissioners elected in 112 years were sworn in by <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s first black federal judge. `` We bring home to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> the harvest of the Martin Luther King voting rights act,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge U.W. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON>, who administered the oath of office Monday to the three blacks and two whites in the county's new government. The election of the first blacks to the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction followed 10 years of legal combat that abolished the old at-large election system which had kept the panel all white for more than a century. Under the new election plan, commissioners are elected from five districts, three with large or nominal black voting majorities. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with a population of 55,000, is about 56 percent black. The three black commissioners _ <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON> <PERSON> Minor </PERSON>, D.L. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Varner </PERSON> _ were sworn in along with white commissioners <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> at a courthouse ceremony in which the overflow crowd of about 300 sang `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' The ceremony coincided with <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s state holiday for both Confederate Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and King, who led the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march.

He and a team of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers helped win the election system change in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>. `` I predict that someday students of modern history will point to <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, as 20th century <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cradle of democracy, where people of all races began to live Doctor King's dream of brotherhood,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said.

 Citing new evidence, the government has reopened the case of four people jailed for life in two 1974 bombings of British pubs that killed seven people, including three soldiers, and injured 91. The bombings occurred during a wave of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorism, and champions of the `` <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four'' said the government had in its zeal to obtain convictions ignored evidence that pointed to other suspects. The Irish government welcomed Monday's decision, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial today that it was `` as difficult as it was wise.'' Responding to pressure that made the case a cause celebre in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told Parliament Monday that new information had emerged meriting that the case be heard by the Court of Appeal. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 36; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlon </PERSON>, 33, were convicted of planting bombs in two pubs frequented by British soldiers in <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION>, a town southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in October 1974. Five people, including two soldiers, were killed and 65 injured. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> also were convicted of a pub bombing in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Woolwich </ORGANIZATION> a month later in which the bartender and a soldier died and 26 people were injured. All four were sentenced to life imprisonment in October 1975, and two years later a court rejected their appeal. In a written reply to a lawmaker's question, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said he was satisfied that `` there are new and substantial points which clearly ... are best considered by the court.'' These, he said, included apparent alibis for <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> that had never been put to a court, and indications that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was injected with drugs during her interrogation and suffering symptoms of withdrawal from barbiturates. `` The possible effects of these drugs on the reliability of her statements were not adequately exposed to the jury or the Court of Appeal,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> declined to act on a point of law raised by two senior <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> judges who have argued that the appeals court ruled against the four despite being aware of confessions by two <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> men to the bombings. The Irish government, in a statement, said it `` has consistently conveyed the serious concern about the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four case to the British authorities.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON>, co-author of `` Time Bomb,'' a recent book on the case, said: `` We are very gratified that this is the first official recognition of the justifiable concern about this case which has attracted people of the eminence of two archbishops, two Law Lords and two former Home Secretaries.'' The archbishops are Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual head of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Archbishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hume </ORGANIZATION>, leader of Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. The Law Lords, two of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most senior judges, are Lord <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> and Lord Scarman. The two former Home Secretaries are <PERSON> Merlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> and Lord <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. Cardinal <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiaich </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic Primate of <LOCATION> All </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, called Monday's move a `` culmination of the efforts of people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who have become convinced of the innocence of these people.'' It is the second time in two years that the government has reopened a case involving people convicted of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> terrorism who claimed to be victims of a miscarriage of justice. Six Irishmen serving life terms for pub bombings in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in 1974 that killed 21 people went before the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> after a similar campaign but their convictions were upheld last year. Like the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> Six, the <LOCATION> Guildford </LOCATION> Four have figured strongly in Anglo-Irish relations. They are held up as examples by those who claim <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> courts are biased against the Irish or those who sympathize with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the 95 percent <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule.

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Human Rights Policies Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two human rights organizations have chastised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for providing military and financial assistance to military groups with poor human rights records. In particular, the organizations cited aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> insurgency in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and the national armies of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The criticism was detailed in a report, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Record on Human Rights in 1988,'' issued Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> New-York </ORGANIZATION> based organization that monitors and promotes human rights worldwide. The two groups praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for placing a greater emphasis on human rights during the last few years than it had earlier. The report noted the administration's insistence that human rights occupy a prominent place in the U.S.-Soviet agenda, which it said has led to improvements in human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including the release of hundreds of political and religious prisoners. While the report acknowledged that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was also responsible for these changes, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was credited with taking `` advantage of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opening'' by placing `` consistent pressure on human rights issues.'' But the report chastised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for largely disregarding `` rights transgressions in a host of friendly countries which attract little public attention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, such as <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' According to the report, `` human rights violations often were overlooked out of fear that criticizing an ally, particularly allied militaries fighting leftist rebellions, would create an opportunity for communist influence.'' For example, it said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` a vocal apologist for gross abuses'' in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> because the country is seen as a front-line state against the Soviet army. The report said the administration's `` most conspicuous failing'' was that it `` rarely protested abuses committed by the military once a civilian occupied a presidential palace ... Moreover, in certain cases, such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and occasionally the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the administration minimized abuses or denied that they were taking place.'' The administration also was attacked for refraining from criticizing human rights violations by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against Palestinians in occupied territories. But the report praised the administration for providing `` pressure at key moments to nudge certain dictators and military juntas allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> towards elections, as well as to protect newly elected civilian governments against military coups.'' For example, the report stated that in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the administration played a role in `` easing out dictators and military juntas and replacing them with elected heads of state.'' It also praised <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, the report gave the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration credit for weighing `` in at key moments when restive militaries threatened to overwhelm newly elected civilian presidents.'' The report called on the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` to report human rights violations accurately and to speak out against serious abuses wherever they are found.'' Human Rights Watch includes the organizations <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch and <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch. The <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is a public interest law center working to promote international human rights law and legal procedures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad.

 The civil defense siren _ that Cold War symbol of the fear of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear attack _ is being silenced in some <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> communities where officials feel it's obsolete `` It blows and it tells you a bomb is coming, but -LRB- the bomb -RRB- would be here already,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` The warning system is out of date,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said recently. `` Most people do n't even know what it's about. It has outlived its usefulness.'' <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is following <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>'s lead. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> counties still use the sirens, and will test them Jan. 27, but other cities, including <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, have chosen silence.

 Thousands of fans howled as superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took center stage adorned in silver chains, resuming a concert tour curtailed in November when he suffered swollen vocal chords. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s manager, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dileo </PERSON>, had announced that this would be <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s final concert tour. The 30-year-old pop phenomenon was clad in black when he opened Monday night's show to about 17,500 people at the Sports Arena. He hit the stage at 8:45 p.m. complete with synchronized light show and heart-thumping choreography. <PERSON> Diehard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> fans did n't seem to care too much about his cancellation of several concert dates, the first of which was Nov. 14. `` We figure it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Busse </PERSON>, a 26-year-old <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> resident who made the long trip with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. The reclusive pop star embarked on a 16-month solo tour to promote his best-selling `` Bad'' album.

 Police are looking for an adult who may have been behind an alleged drug-selling venture by two boys, ages 10 and 14, who were arrested with $ 226 cash and three vials of crack in their pockets. The youngsters were charged Sunday with possession of a controlled substance, but the charges were reduced to juvenile delinquency because of their ages. They were to appear in <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Family Court today. The boys told police they had been working with an adult. They both had family court warrants against them on non-drug related juvenile delinquency charges. `` It's a crying shame,'' said <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynagh </PERSON>. `` These dealers are using whatever means they have to sell crack.''

<HEAD>Problems Plague Housing Once Called ``Miracle'' by Jimmy Carter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Evictions, maintenance complaints and other landlord-tenant disputes are plaguing a low-cost housing project for the formerly homeless that was called a miracle by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> helped put up the four-townhouse complex in 1986 through his association with <ORGANIZATION> Habitat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> organization based in <LOCATION> Americus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, that builds and rehabilitates houses for the homeless nationwide. Tenants, who help construct the buildings, are selected by a Habitat screening committee. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, tenants are complaining of verbal abuse, poor construction and unanswered pleas for help. Habitat officials say the tenants are n't meeting their obligations. A family of eight was evicted earlier this month for not paying rent, the second eviction in nine months at the four-unit complex. `` None of us can believe what is happening,'' said <PERSON> Arbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a mother of seven who owes $ 1,000 in rent and is fighting in court to avoid seeing her family become the third evicted. Habitat ca n't be expected to pick up the tab, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keen </PERSON>, an official with a Habitat chapter in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It's painful that we have to take these kinds of actions against families, because it's contrary to everything we stand for in trying to reform these people,'' Keen said. `` But everyone that claims to need help does n't deserve help, and people who are not living up to the very basic obligation of the minimal amount expected of them _ well, we had no other choice.'' Several families were threatened with eviction in July 1987 after falling behind in their rent. They said heating and maintenance problems led to huge utility bills and other problems. Habitat founder <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> and the group's West Side chapter reached an agreement with the families, reducing rents from $ 300 to $ 264 and promising to correct the problems. Keen said the group had no choice but to begin evictions when tenants continued to withhold rent. The latest to lose their apartment were <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and their eight children. Mrs. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said she returned home earlier this month to find her children huddled outside in the cold and the family's possessions strewn along the curb. The family owed $ 1,300 in rent, but Mrs. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said she had withheld some payments to protest unfinished work on the building. She said she had just found a job when sheriff's deputies arrived with the eviction notice. `` We helped build that house, my 14-year-old and I,'' she said. `` When I heard what was happening, I rushed home with my new boss, and we begged and pleaded with Mr. Keen. `` My boss pledged to pay whatever Keen wanted, and the sheriff said it was up to Mr. Keen, but <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keen </PERSON> said ` No,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Keen said he was told by Habitat officials in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to throw the family out. `` There was an error made in evicting that family,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said Monday. `` People are going to think Habitat is a heartless organization that throws mothers and children out in the street in the dead of winter. That is not the case. This is the first time anybody has been evicted.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the group's regional director will be directed to `` fully investigate just what the situation is in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, so we can rectify it.'' `` We are aware that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Habitat </LOCATION> has had rental problems with these families,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. But `` two wrongs do n't make a right.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said that of 324 cities in which Habitat operates, `` We have had more trouble in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> than any other city. Only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has had similar problems.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will try to ensure free access to the resort of <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> vacationers when it opens talks with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> later this week on the disputed border area, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a 250-acre strip of land at the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, has troubled Egyptian-Israeli relations since <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to give back the land when it completed its withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> in 1982. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> decided Monday that the government will not set any preconditions for the negotiations, which open Thursday in <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> and will involve Israeli, Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegations. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war and returned the desert to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in accordance with the 1979 U.S.-mediated peace treaty. The <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> dispute went to international arbitration. Last Sept. 29, a five-member panel met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and awarded <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> some disputed key border points, but said it was not authorized to determine the final demarcation line. The debate now hinges on the sovereignity over the actual beach area, which has an Israeli-owned hotel and a cabana. At the Cabinet meeting, right-wing Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> insisted on linking the <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> negotiations with full normalization of ties between the two countries. The Cabinet rejected the idea. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> expressed hope the Cabinet decision would pave the way for improved ties: `` We have paid the price for peace and now we want to ensure the improvement of relations. `` We hope to create conditions for the continuing presence of Israelis in the area ... and to solve the problem of compensation by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to the owners of the hotel,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio. `` We hope the Egyptians are interested in developing the ties, in turning <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> into an example of coexistence.'' The radio said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> negotiators were instructed to seek free access to <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> for vacationing Israelis and common management of the Sonesta hotel there.

<HEAD>Reagan Gets Fond Farewell From Soviet Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, once referred to as a lunatic and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> by the Soviet media, got a respectful farewell from a government newspaper that credited him for helping to forge warmer superpower ties. Another leading Soviet newspaper gave a glowing portrait Monday of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, calling him `` one of the architects of the turning point in Soviet-U. relations.'' `` Of course, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has remained <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the anti-communist and the troubadour of Western society,'' the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in a front-page article. `` But the restructuring of international relations could not bypass the White House.'' In 1984, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped into an open microphone that he would begin bombing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in five minutes. In the last days of his presidency, however, Soviets recall not those `` five minutes'' but his five summit meetings with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. `` And this is not because we have short memories, but because a long road lies ahead of us, which we can only overcome together,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Melor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON>, a former U.S.-based correspondent. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, carried an extraordinarily intimate profile of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secretary of state since July 1982. In the recent warming between the superpowers, Pravda said, `` <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s realism had a telling effect, as well as his sober recognition of the fact that in the nuclear age, the self-preservation of our two countries can be guaranteed only by the avenues of dialogue.'' Pravda also told its readers that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state is a father of five, an experienced gourmet cook, an ardent golf and tennis player and an avid devotee of ballroom dancing _ surprising revelations in a country where most citizens know virtually nothing about the lives of their own leaders. Pravda did make one barbed criticism of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in its profile of the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member, saying he had been keener than former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops `` to different corners of the planet to defend American interests.'' It also said his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy had been a flop, but that it was necessary to pay <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` his due'' for recognizing in the 11th hour of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency that it was time to begin a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In his eight years as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been labeled a `` lunatic'' by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency in 1983, and likened by Pravda to a Nazi, an explosive comparison in a country that lost 20 million people in World War II. The state-run media also made much of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s own harshest comments, such as his March 1983 description of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` an evil empire'' and his quip the following year about launching a bombing attack. The official image of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> began to warm with the coming of the 1985 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> summit, and with changes made in both domestic and foreign policy by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985. `` Without our ` perestroika' -LRB- restructuring -RRB-, there would have been no ` perestroika' of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` New political thinking and a new world view dictated our ` docking' together. `` During his eight years in the White House, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recognized this,'' the newspaper said. At the close of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, Soviet media cast him as a trustworthy bargaining partner. <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> expressed the hope that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will be sworn in Friday, would continue in his footsteps. `` The last film made by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the actor, in 1964, was called ` The Killers,''' commentator <PERSON> Sturua </PERSON> wrote. He said he hoped the last episode of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political life, `` where he leaves the White House and passes the baton to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, -LRB- would -RRB- be called, ` Continuity.'''

 Fourteen Czech human rights activists were still in custody today after their arrests during demonstrations to commemorate a student who burned himself alive to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. The group included banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON>, a former spokeswoman for the Charter 77 human rights group who last year had an audience with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Also among the 14 identified by Czechoslovak state-run media as being in custody were <PERSON> Alexandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>, Charter 77 spokespersons. The arrests Monday came as hundreds of riot police and water cannons moved into <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s central Wenceslas Square for a second straight day to disperse demonstrators, some of whom attempted to lay flowers in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, who set himself alight there on Jan. 16, 1969 and died three days later. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> was protesting the August 1968 invasiton that crushed `` Prague Spring'' liberal reforms. On Sunday, 5,000 protesters had rallied throughout <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and an official report said 91 were arrested as police crushed the demonstration with clubs, dogs and water cannon. About 500 people attended a Roman Catholic memorial Mass for <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> in the city of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION> on Monday, and the priest referred repeatedly to `` Jan the martyr'' without mentioning <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s name, participants said. Witnesses said they saw secret police inside and outside the church and riot police in side streets off <PERSON> Brno </PERSON>'s central Freedom Square, where the crowd headed after the Mass. The demonstrations have coincided with a meeting of 35 <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to mark a comprehensive human rights accord between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. In a speech to the conference, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today condemned <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> for suppressing the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the fact that police used clubs, tear gas and water cannon on peaceful participants directly violated <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s commitment to 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> agreement was a review of those accords. The secretary also deplored what he called `` the timidity'' of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in not granting a greater freedom of expression and assembly to their people. Witnesses in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said most of the people on the square Monday were passers-by on their way home from work. As activists attempted to lay flowers, a crowd began to gather. Police then moved in in cars, vans and with two water cannons, said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabatova </PERSON>, a Charter 77 activist. They were later joined by hundreds of riot police, and the water cannon then began dousing the crowd. Police also have used force to break up demonstrations by thousands in August and October. The <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Vecerni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Praha </ORGANIZATION> charged that Charter 77 was `` inviting people to <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and did not respect the wish of the majority to preserve peace.'' In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, church sources said Monday that authorities released most of the 190 people detained after police used clubs and water cannon to break up a demonstration by human rights activists in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. About 800 human rights activists gathered at a downtown square in the southern city Sunday to demand that Communist authorities allow democracy. In <LOCATION> Plovdiv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, at least seven human rights activists were arrested Jan. 11. State-run media said they face prosecution, probably for anti-state activity. All were believed members of an independent Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Soviets Hand Out Rations As Food and Fuel Crises Worsen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government soldiers today pushed back with clubs and tree branches a crowd that thronged Soviet troops as they doled out emergency fuel rations in an impoverished section of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Less than a month before the scheduled <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal, the besieged capital is plagued by severe food and fuel shortages. One woman was knocked to the ground as the crowd, ignoring repeated shouts from megaphone-toting Soviet soldiers to back away, surged around the three armored personnel vehicles distributing fuel in the <LOCATION> Khairkhana </LOCATION> section. People banged on empty gasoline cans as the Afghan soldiers shoved back the crowd. One soldier, a rifle under his arm, kicked and punched several teen-agers. Soviet troops, five aboard each armored car, looked uncomfortable as they poured gasoline for home heating into cans held up by people who waited in 19-degree temperatures at the front of the line. `` My children are cold, I've never seen conditions so bad,'' said one woman, who gave her name as <PERSON> Aziza </PERSON>, a 35-year-old with nine children. Another woman wailed as she held out her hands to a reporter and _ speaking through an interpreter _ pleaded for help, saying she and her children were hungry. Asked if she thought the reporter was a Soviet, she said, `` All I know is you are foreigners, perhaps you can help us.'' The Soviet unit used the megaphones to spread word of the emergency distribution as the armored vehicles, with 75mm cannons pointing skyward, rolled into <LOCATION> Khairkhana </LOCATION>. In other parts of the city, lines of several hundred cars and buses snaked around entire blocks waiting for fuel. Children joined bread lines outside shacks owned by private bread sellers, who get their dwindling wheat supplies from a state-run wheat silo. Western aid officials expressed growing alarm at the shortages. They are blamed on increasing disruption of Soviet-escorted supply convoys by anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas attacking the key <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, which runs north from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border. First signs of the latest shortages came after more Soviet troops pulled out early this month, Western diplomats reported. The situation appears to have worsened considerably this week. Diplomats say Soviet troops are pulling out of the capital ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline set in a U.N.-mediated agreement. The withdrawal comes nearly a decade after <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intervened to prop up a Marxist government. Under the agreement, 50,000 Soviet troops left by Aug. 15. The guerrillas, who have ignored calls for a cease-fire by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, appear to be tightening an economic blockade of the capital and are viewed as increasingly effective as Afghan soldiers take over <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> road defenses from departing Soviet units. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, today said the struggle for scarce food and fuel has cut attendance at its 40 mother and child welfare clinics in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> by nearly half. `` They say they ca n't come because they have to stand in bread and fuel queues,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> mission. In the fuel line in <LOCATION> Khairkhana </LOCATION>, an old, bearded man, his hands trembling as he clutched his empty gasoline can, said, `` Allah has brought this on us. We are black-faced in the sight of Allah.'' Others blamed the fighting or said the guerrillas were trying to cut off the capital. Some said they now do n't want the Soviets _ about whom Afghans in the street are usually openly hostile _ to leave.

 A previously unknown group claiming to hold a former prime minister today issued a ransom demand and threatened to kill him, officials said. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soir </ORGANIZATION> received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> asking for a ransom of between $ 525,000 and $ 790,000 for former Prime Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandoren </PERSON>, the deputy <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> prosecutor. He said the letter called <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, a 69-year-old Christian Democrat who disappeared outside his home Saturday, as `` a representative of conservative capitalism.'' `` It was a one-page, typewritten letter with political and financial demands,'' said an official at <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soir </ORGANIZATION>. He did not elaborate. Earlier, a man claiming to speak for the previously unknown group call <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soir </ORGANIZATION> and said <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` will only be seen back in small pieces.'' Officials said a special police crisis center set up to locate <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> received a similar call. The group claimed it had kidnapped <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeyants </PERSON> in weekend phone calls to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Soir </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s French-language radio network. In <LOCATION> Hilversum </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, a caller purporting to be a member of a French extremist left-wing group claimed responsibility for kidnapping <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> in a call to a radio stations, police said today. They said the male caller, who spoke Dutch with a Belgian accent, said Action Directe, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most notorious left-wing terrorist group, was holding <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Hilversum </LOCATION> who demanded anonymity said: `` we are taking this seriously.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` had received threats lately'' and had asked to meet with the interior minister Monday, presumably to discuss his personal safety. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late 1978 until early 1979. He was defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. He has also been a controversial politician. He received a three-year suspended sentence in 1986 for tax fraud as head of his meat packaging business and is under investigation for taking bribes while he was defense minister. He had been scheduled to appear today before a special legislative investigating commission. The 1986 conviction forced <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> to drop his bid for mayor of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in October.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said today he intends to meet communist leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the near future to end 40 years of bitter rivalry between the two nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is preparing a `` realistic'' proposal to eventually reunite the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> by seeing the north not as an enemy but as `` a partner that also seeks to solve this problem,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a news conference. `` Besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between south and <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, I will realize inter-Korean summit talks in the near future and achieve epoch-making progress in resolving the Korean question,'' he said. Leaders of the two Koreas have never met.

Outlining his administration's plans for the coming year, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the government would continue its efforts to build a strong democratic system and ensure economic growth to raise living standards. But he also said violent anti-government radicals posed a threat to political stability, and said the government would enforce tough controls to end violent protests and strikes. `` Stern action will be taken to check violent activities intended to topple our democratic society,'' he said. The unusually tough warning was aimed at dissidents and radical students that have mounted violent anti-government protests demanding the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government. The radicals, who claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule, have little public support and their protests, while violent, often are on a small scale. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to work to create democratic government and political stability. He said the change to democracy since the end of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s authoritarian government had exposed and aggravated many problems that had to be solved. `` Desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at once. Discord and discontent among different social strata ... have been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society,'' he said. The <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms since anti-government protests in June 1987 forced the authoritarian <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> government to agree to elections and an end to widespread repression. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> touched several times on hopes for an end to the tense confrontation with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their creation in 1948 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. The north invaded the south to start the 1950-53 Korean War and the two sides have clashed repeatedly over the years.

 About 2,000 members of the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> minority in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> have fled to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> following intensified attacks by Burmese troops against their rebel camps along the border, a senior police officer said today. Reporters in the area said ten civilians of the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> _ one of a dozen ethnic minority groups in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> _ were wounded by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> mortar attacks that began Sunday. Police Col. <PERSON> Amphon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngamchit </PERSON>, superintendant of Tak province, said <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> authorities allowed the refugees to remain on the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> side of the <LOCATION> Moei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which marks the border, but prevented them from going deeper into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amphon </ORGANIZATION> said about 1,000 Burmese troops backed by mortars were attacking about 500 <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> guerrillas opposite the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> district of Tha Song Yang in Tak. In recent months, the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> army has stepped up its attacks against the <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>, retaking the border village of <LOCATION> Mae </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waw </LOCATION> and disrupting the rebels' main source of revenue _ a lucrative smuggling trade between <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> today insisted that East bloc nations implement human rights accords and cease repression. In a speech to a 35-nation human rights conference, he said that while `` we are entering a period in which respect for human rights is gaining ground,'' there were remaining `` dark areas'' in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He condemned <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> for forcibly suppressing demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Sunday and detaining scores of them. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> departed from his text and added criticism of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> where, he noted, scores of human rights demonstrators were arrested in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Sunday. As in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, most of the East Germans have not yet been freed. He said the arrests stood `` in glaring contradiction to the solemn international commitment'' given by the communist governments. Later, at a news conference, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for declaring it would not be obliged to comply with all provisions of the new human rights declaration adopted here Sunday. `` You have to keep calling these things as you see them,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He underscored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that all of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> follow the pace set by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in his speech to the human rights conference, said riot police, using rubber truncheons, tear gas and water cannon on peaceful participants, directly violated the Czech government's commitment to the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords And he deplored what he called `` the timidity'' of the governments of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in not granting greater freedom of expression and assembly to their people. He said their reluctance contrasted with `` welcome progress'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and two of its Eastern allies, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But even in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, the release of more than 600 political prisoners left others `` unjustly imprisoned.'' He pledged: `` We can not forget them.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who leaves office with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Friday, spoke at ceremonies near the end of a 27-month review of compliance with the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Final Act, which sought to ease East-West tensions while promoting a freer exchange of people and ideas between East and West. He said the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> promise has served as a `` positive force for change,'' but that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> still lives with `` a legacy of the Cold War.'' In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, he said `` the political and civil rights of all citizens are being `` eroded at a discouraging rate,'' adding that in both <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> minorities have been `` particularly hard hit'' by recent government policies. On the other hand, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, more than 7 million East Germans visited the West last year and about 77,000 people emigrated from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We still look for full recognition of the right to freedom of movement throughout the Eastern signatory states,'' he said. The Helksinki accord was signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 32 European countries. It tacitly accepted the post-World War II boundaries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had long sought, while providing the Western democracies with a lever to promote more openness in the East. Before flying home, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met briefly with <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, the West German foreign minister. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been working to dissuade Western firms from providing technology to help <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop chemical weapons. On Monday, a West German official said a West German company may have unknowingly aided in the construction of a suspected chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he talked about `` other things'' with <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. But in response to questions from reporters, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said: `` I believe having reviewed the evidence, there is no question whatever that -LRB- <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> is trying to equip himself with a major chemical weapons production facility. `` He has n't quite got there yet. They need aid from the outside in order to get there,'' he said. `` We are trying to do everything we can to throw every conceivable monkey wrench that we can find into his machinery, and in doing so we are active in your behalf, in my behalf _ I do n't want poison gas dumped on me Do you? _ and I do n't want <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> to have it, or have an ability to give it to some terrorists.''

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He's Abolishing All State Institutions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> says that all state institutions, including the `` security apparatus'' and the nation's news agency, will be abolished this year. In a speech Monday night that was broadcast by Libyan television and monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said it was the people who should rule. `` All the institutions which are traditionally considered as state institutions are to be abolished,'' he said in a speech to a Basic People's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or grass-roots political committee, in the community of <PERSON> Al-Jabal </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Akhdar </PERSON>. `` These companies, these institutions and all these bodies seem to be literally imposed on you. ... They are going to be abolished from this year,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. He said that although people's congresses created the institutions, people still considered them as `` outside their power and belonging to a government.'' `` The struggle for power must end,'' he said in a rare acknowledgement of internal dissent. `` The demonstrations, the sit-ins and the protests are all protests -LRB- against -RRB- authority, a struggle for power.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said the action would be the cornerstone for a new time known as `` the era of the masses.'' The Libyan leader said that he also will abolish organized sports, car importing companies and agricultural produce marketing companies so farmers would be free to market their own produce. The government will help find work for those left jobless by the moves, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. He said the nation's security apparatus must be eliminated `` because complaints are mounting against it and its violations are on the increase.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also said the agency duplicates operations of the nation's bureau of investigation. He described the news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> as `` a huge octopus with hundreds of officials'' that is `` useless.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Jamahiriyah </ORGANIZATION> news agency is one of those establishments which is tiring me. ... The news item broadcast by the world today, our agency reports it to us the day after tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, who took power in a 1969 coup, has always described his goal as the creation of a political system in which people run the country without parties or government bodies. In recent months, he has made moderating moves in internal politics. In August, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> announced the abolition of the `` classical army and the traditional police,'' saying the country would rely instead on armed civilians for security. Last March, riding a bulldozer, he knocked down the wall of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s prison and freed some political prisoners. He also said Libyans were free to travel abroad and gave his blessing to the flourishing black market.

<HEAD>Falwell Says Beginning Of End Of Abortions Is At Hand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> told 2,000 people at a church service that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to review a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law might signal the beginning of the end of legal abortions. `` There's no question that abortion will be done away with,'' said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, founder of the Moral Majority. `` The trend is clearly toward life and away from death. The abortionists are losing, and that is why they are becoming so frantic.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has announced that it will rule on the legality of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that bans the use of public hospitals, employees and money for abortions. The law was struck down by lower courts and now is on appeal. While <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> hailed the prospect of the high court taking up abortion, which was legalized in 1973 in the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> case, he also said he wanted more ironclad guarantees than the court could provide. `` Our ultimate goal is a constitutional amendment. A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversal or modification of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> would be a good step in the right direction, but it is not the answer we're seeking,'' he said. Before Monday night's meeting, 15 protesters marched in front of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Snellville </ORGANIZATION> chanting slogans against <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Snellville </LOCATION> is an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb. `` We want to let <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> know that whenever he's in town we'll be there to protest because he endorses and finances <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> and its agenda to suppress women's rights,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelham </PERSON>, leader of a group called the Coalition Opposing Operation Rescue. Operation Rescue is a New York-based group that staged the long-running anti-abortion protests in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that began during the Democratic National Convention last summer.

 Gunmen today assassinated an official of a government panel charged with recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth of ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates, police said.

They said <PERSON> Ronan </PERSON> apparently managed to hit one of the assailants with his car. Witnesses said the man was injured and had to be dragged away by his companions, who escaped after commandeering a motorcycle with a sidecar. Police said a motive for the assassination could not be immediately established. There was no claim of responsibility. But commission officials said the attack was staged by `` organized enemies'' of the commission. They did not identify the enemies. Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ronan </PERSON> was killed because he enforced orders to sequester companies that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or his `` front men'' are believed to have acquired illegally during <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule. `` Some power groups may be trying to send us a message,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Federis </PERSON>, the commission's investigations director. <PERSON> Federis </PERSON> said about four hours after <PERSON> Ronan </PERSON> was killed, a man telephoned his office and told his secretary, `` Tell -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federis </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- he is next.''

<HEAD>Court Says California Redistricting Plan Doesn't Discriminate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan that placed Democrats in control of the state's congressional delegation does not unlawfully discriminate against Republicans, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the redistricting plan. Republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of gerrymandering. The court dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> appeal last Oct. 3. But then on Nov. 14 the justices announced that they might consider the case after all. The reasons for the court's second thoughts in November were not explained. Today, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> voted to grant full review to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dispute. Four votes are needed to grant such review. Six justices joined in upholding the redistricting plan in a one-sentence decision. `` The judgment is affirmed,'' they said. The court said in 1986 in an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> legislative reapportionment case that gerrymandering _ the manipulation of voting district boundaries for partisan gain _ may be unlawful even when it results in districts meeting the `` one-person, one-vote'' requirement. But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> plan that was attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights. The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only four justices joined in the court's main opinion authored by Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it `` will consistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on the political processes as a whole.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans said that is exactly what has happened to them. `` The essence of representative democracy is undermined'' when `` a computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what the congressional results will be throughout the decade,'' they said in seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reconsideration. A three-judge federal court, by a 2-1 vote last April, upheld <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s plan. The federal court said Republicans failed to show that the plan deprived them of political power and fair representation. `` There are no allegations that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans have been shut out of the political process, nor are there allegations that anyone has ever interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> registration, organizing, voting, fund-raising or campaigning,'' said Judge <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> for the federal court. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, noting that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, a Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and 18 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, said there is no evidence the party is `` bereft of the ability to exercise potent power in the political process as a whole.'' Republicans said the Democratic-controlled state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rigged district lines to allow Democrats to win 27 of the 45 House seats from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> even though <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates overall received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections. They said the Democrats manipulated the outcome of elections by ignoring county and municipal boundaries and bunching <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters in some districts to produce lopsided <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victories. Democratic voters were divided strategically to help the party win close races, the Republicans contend. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders also have appealed to the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled in the past that election districts must be equally populated in accord with the `` one-person, one-vote'' principle. The justices have held that only if there is evidence of racial bias may a district plan be overturned even when the balanced population test is met. The case acted on today is <PERSON> Badham </PERSON> vs. Eu, 87-1818.

<TEXT>
 A previously unknown terrorist group today demanded a $ 790,000 ransom for the release of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, the former Belgian prime minister it claims to have kidnapped. In a one-page typewritten letter, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> demanded that two-thirds of the ransom come from <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>' political and business partners and be given to the poor, according to deputy <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandoren </PERSON>. The rest of the ransom would be for the group's `` participation in the effort to mobilize ... the people.'' Initially, it was incorrectly reported that the kidnappers were demanding a ransom of between $ 525,000 _ two-thirds of the total sum _ and $ 790,000. The letter, delivered to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> dailies <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Soir </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Het </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laatste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nieuws </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` a corrupt person ... who has stolen large public funds for his own profit'' and called for a `` people's tribunal'' to try him. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, 69, a businessman and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> politician who disappeared Saturday, is under investigation for taking bribes when he was defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. A special legislative commission was to open a hearing today to consider initiating legal action against him. The letter reinforced the belief the kidnapping is politically motivated. It did not threaten the life of the politician, unlike two anonymous phone calls earlier today to police in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Soir </PERSON>. `` We have VdB,'' said the caller, using the politician's nickname `` Who we are you will never know. You will never see him again. We will return him in small pieces.'' <PERSON> Vandoren </PERSON> related the threat to reporters. A third call, received by a radio station in <LOCATION> Hilversum </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, came from an anonymous caller purporting to represent the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> terrorist group Direct Action. He said the group is holding <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` had received threats lately'' and asked to meet the interior minister Monday, presumably to discuss his personal safety. Officials have expressed concern about the health of the politician, who needs daily medication for a heart condition. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late 1978 until early 1979. He received a three-year suspended sentence for tax fraud as head of his meat packaging business in 1986. That conviction forced him to drop a bid to become mayor of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in October.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's research that the groups say may link smoking to health hazards. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that allows public access to material compiled for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The case stems from a lawsuit by the widow and daughter of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. The suit alleged that <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s death from lung cancer in 1980 was caused by cigarette smoking, and accused <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> of failing to warn adequately of the consequences of smoking. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> ruled against the <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> family. But in 1987 anti-smoking groups asked the judge to release research conducted for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> that the groups said may show cigarette smoking causes disease. The groups are Public Citizen, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The judge, who kept the material secret while the suit was pending, permitted the groups access to the documents after he dismissed the case. His ruling on disclosure of the documents was upheld last September by the 1st <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said that under federal court rules `` the public has a presumptive right of access to -LRB- such -RRB- materials unless good cause for confidentiality is shown, and ... no good cause exists here'' for secrecy. Cigarette manufacturers have been successful generally in winning lawsuits accusing them of contributing to lung cancer and other diseases. But in June 1988 a federal jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and awarded a smoker's widower $ 400,000, the first time damages were ordered for a disease said to be caused by smoking. That suit was brought by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, whose wife, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, died of lung cancer in 1984. The case acted on today is <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> vs. Public Citizen, 88-825.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge to Virginia Law on Child-Care Centers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a challenge to a state law exempting religiously affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety standards all other child-care centers must meet. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law does not violate the constitutionally required separation of government and religion. The disputed 1979 state licensing law allows child-care centers run by churches or other religious organizations to seek an exempt status _ avoiding many of the health and safety standards applied to such facilities. Exempt centers still must meet basic health and safety standards, however. Child-care centers with no religious affiliation must obtain a state license, and are not entitled to seek the exemption. Among the 215 centers that could obtain exempt status under the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law, 106 have opted instead to operate with state licenses. The law was challenged in 1980 by three licensed child-care centers that have no religious ties _ <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Early </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, Academy Day Care in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Holloman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION>. A federal judge struck down the exemption as unconstitutional but the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed that ruling last May 6. `` Absent the exemption, some church leaders would immediately be forced to violate their convictions against submitting aspects of their ministries to state licensing, or face legal action,'' the appeals court said. Its ruling relied heavily on a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in which the justices said religious organizations may practice employment discrimination by favoring members of their faith even for non-religious jobs. In that case, the court unanimously upheld the firing in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> of a gymnasium custodian who failed to qualify for membership in the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which owned and ran the gym. The court, in that 1987 ruling, said a 1972 federal law exempting religious groups from a federal anti-bias law does not violate separation of church and state. After the non-religious centers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> appealed the 4th Circuit court's decision, state officials filed a counter-appeal contending that the appeals court was wrong in ruling that the centers had the proper `` standing'' to challenge the 1979 law. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied review to both appeals. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Early </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 88-730, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Early Learning Center, 88-932.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Ruling on Labor Unions in Missouri Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today set aside a ruling that limited the access enjoyed by labor unions that represent federal government employees to the home addresses of all their members. The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to have their addresses withheld from their union. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> decided in two cases that denying the unions access to the information is an unfair labor practice. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> limited the authority's decision in a ruling last January. The appeals court said that although unions generally are entitled to the addresses, the information may not be disclosed without the employee's consent. In a brief order today, the justices set aside the 8th Circuit court's ruling and ordered the appeals court to restudy the two cases in light of regulations published by the two federal agencies involved. In one case, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> sought the names and home addresses of some 900 union members who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In the second case, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> asked for names and addresses of members who work for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mapping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The unions said they needed the home addresses to communicate with members in the privacy of their homes about pending collective bargaining negotiations. The unions also said the information could help them in recruiting new members. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said disclosing the information does not violate workers' privacy rights. But the 8th Circuit court said, `` We doubt that the public interest would be served in any way by imposing disclosure of the names and addresses on employees who regard that information as private and who do not choose to receive union communications at home.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FELA </ORGANIZATION> asked the justices to overturn the appeals court's ruling In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers told the high court that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is seeking to resolve the problem by taking steps to provide the unions in both cases with the information they seek. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said they believe government agencies should be allowed to withhold the names and addresses but that providing the information is a better solution in these cases. They said requiring agencies to get the consent of employees before giving such information to the unions violates federal law. The consent requirment could mean that the government will be threatened with lawsuits anytime it gives out even innocuous information about federal employees, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said. They said the justices should order the 8th Circuit court to reconsider its decision in light of the steps being taken to provide the unions with the names and addresses they seek. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, 88-349.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Revive Dallas Lead Pollution Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to revive a $ 200 million lawsuit that accused a federal environmental official of failing to take swift action against industrial lead pollution in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the suit against the government. The suit was filed by 189 families in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> who live near three lead smelters, operated by <ORGANIZATION> RSR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dixie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and N.L. Industries. They sought damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which allows citizens to sue the government in some circumstances. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> families said members have suffered brain damage, developmental defects and `` lifelong debilitating effects'' from lead pollution. Their suit said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, deputy administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was negligent because he ordered further study of the problem rather than an immediate clean-up after a congressional hearing in 1983 found high levels of lead in soil and in schoolchildren's blood samples. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here last July upheld a federal judge's ruling that dismissed the case. The appeals court said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s decision to order further study was a discretionary policy-making action immune from suit under the Tort Claims Act. The plaintiffs said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s decision was based only upon scientific considerations that did not involve the exercise of such discretion. But the appeals court said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> based his decision on `` economic, social and political policy considerations'' making his choice immune from suit. For example, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said he was concerned that a clean-up would set a precedent for other areas of the nation. He also said that failure to order further study would expose him to criticism he acted too hastily. One of the smelters made a pollution clean-up offer. But <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said he was reluctant to accept the offer without additional study because the clean-up might be inadequate. The case is <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-653.

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> failed today in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> attempt to overturn his conviction for mail fraud and other bribery-related charges. The court, without comment, let stand <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>'s conviction, prison sentence of a year and a day and $ 205,000 fine. The case received national attention when <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>'s co-defendant, former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, 47, fatally shot himself at a news conference Jan. 22, 1987, the day before he was to be sentenced. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said he was innocent, accused the federal prosecutor of framing him and then stuck the barrel of a handgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> candymaker, and <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> were convicted in federal court in December 1986 of mail fraud, perjury, conspiracy to commit bribery and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering. They were charged with arranging the award of a state contract to <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- CTA -RRB-, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company that helps employers recover excess Social Security taxes paid to the federal government. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> and two company officials, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torquato </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, took part in the bribery scheme. <PERSON> Torquato </PERSON>, who cooperated with the prosecution, testified that he agreed to pay $ 300,000 to be divided equally between <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s re-election campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in return for a $ 5 million state contract for his company <ORGANIZATION> CTA </ORGANIZATION> was awarded the contract in 1984, with the state rejecting a lower bid from <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a nationally known accounting firm. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>'s conviction last July, rejecting his claim that he was tried improperly under a federal mail fraud law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 ruled that the anti-fraud law could not be used to charge officials with depriving the public of its intangible right to honest government. The court said there must be a charge that the state lost something of material value. The 3rd Circuit court said the indictment against <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> and the others did allege a material loss since the state could have saved the taxpayers money by awarding the contract to <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said even though the indictment against <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> spoke of intangible rights, the conviction must stand because there also was a material loss. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, urging the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reject <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>'s appeal, noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 amended federal anti-fraud law to permit indictments based solely on a deprivation of intangible rights. The amendments, in effect, reversed the 1987 high court ruling for future government corruption cases. The 3rd Circuit court also rejected <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>'s argument that he was charged mistakenly as a `` public official'' rather than as a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official. The case is <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-532.

<TEXT>
 A judge has ruled that an unwed <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> woman may sue a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nun who encouraged the woman to give up her newborn daughter almost three years ago. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, filed a $ 5 million lawsuit charging Sister <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and her agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> for Dependent Children, with `` wrongful deprivation of custody.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedeff </PERSON> ruled Friday that Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> could sue the nun and the agency for social work malpractice. But the judge denied Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s attempt to add as a defendant Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Magovern </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the private charitable organization has no legal relationship with the archdiocese, although <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> sits on its board of directors. The agency's operations include the care of neglected children, <PERSON> Magovern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Magovern </PERSON> said he had not read the judge's ruling and had no comment on it. Ms. <PERSON> Lebedeff </PERSON> said she found no previous cases of social work malpractice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. But she argued that social workers are professionals since they are licensed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. The judge said that `` practicing one's profession fraudulently, incompetently or negligently constitutes professional misconduct.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> gave birth to a girl on April 6, 1986. Four days later the child was placed with a couple in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said she was reassured by Sister <PERSON> Gilson </PERSON> that she could regain custody of the child within 30 days if she changed her mind about giving her up for adoption. But Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> did not regain custody of the child until March 1987, after a bitter court fight. A <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> appeals court ordered the baby, <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, returned to Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> after finding that the woman had signed surrender papers `` under duress and perhaps even fraud'' in a busy diner on May 1, 1986. The court said that agency officials did nothing when the couple refused to return the child after Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said on May 20 that she wanted her baby back.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> today urged the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to legalize the Solidarity trade federation for a two-year trial period. He said the government ban on Solidarity should be lifted only on condition that it be `` a partner,'' not an opponent that would `` pull the country into anarchy.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> also suggested Solidarity _ which was outlawed in 1982 _ should give up the financial assistance it receives from the West. The prime minister said that during the trial period, both the government and Solidarity would gather `` positive and negative experiences,'' according to a TV account of his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The trial period would last until May 3, 1991, he said. That date is the 200th anniversary of the adoption of a short-lived but still admired progressive constitution in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that was overthrown by Imperial <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Earlier today, <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON>, newly appointed party secretary, told the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he endorsed the stand of the ruling Politburo on union pluralism. His comments suggested the Politburo already has sanctioned allowing more than one legal trade union. Permitting more than one union is a `` social necessity and not a gesture of the government or the party. In the interests of social peace, social agreement has to be reached,'' <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON> said. He stressed those which receive permission to function should show responsibility and `` above all endorse the principles of the law.'' The discussion is crucial, as communist leaders struggle to decide whether to risk repeating the experiment of 1980 that allowed creation of Solidarity as the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent union. After 16 months of exhilarating freedom, Solidarity was suppressed in a 1981 military crackdown. Since then, the Polish economy has stagnated and reforms have been hamstrung by many workers' and independent groups' refusal to participate as long as Solidarity is illegal. At the second session of the two-day <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, the manager of southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Katowice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION> warned that competing trade unions might bring `` anarchy and divided work crews.'' <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolomyjski </PERSON> urged talks with the opposition to make clear `` proper conditions'' for gradually introducing pluralism. A government source had told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> last week that the meeting will end with a decision to offer Solidarity legalization under certain conditions, thus paving the way for talks with its chairman, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>, the party's chief ideologist, told the meeting Monday that the question of allowing union pluralism was `` ripe to be solved,'' and said a draft statement on the topic had been prepared for a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems they will register Solidarity,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist. If so, he said, formal talks between the authorities and the opposition could begin soon. But <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turzynski </PERSON>, a party leader from southwest <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said groups which receive Western aid _ a definition that would include Solidarity _ should be barred from public dialogue. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official union federation OPZZ, told the meeting Monday that no decision on trade unions should be taken before a party conference on ideology next month, the state news service <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>' official alliance, factory-based party organizations, and elements of the army and police remain among Solidarity's strongest opponents, according to party sources Polish leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, said in an opening speech Monday: `` Today we will draw directions of democracy which will include some pluralistic solutions.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when it met last month to evaluate the opinions of local party members toward Solidarity and return with their assessment in mid-January. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has warned the public's patience is wearing thin after years of rising prices and consumer shortages _ threatening a social explosion even he might be unable to control. The country's foreign debt stands at $ 39 billion and many of its major industrial plants are outmoded. Unrest over communist authorities' handling of the economy has toppled governments three times in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>: in 1956, 1970 and 1980.

 Here are excerpts from the report on former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Professional Responsibility: Conclusion `` We trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether an independent counsel seeks an official's indictment. We found that the independent counsel's report far from vindicates Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>; rather, it details conduct which should not be tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Were he still serving as attorney general, we would recommend to the acting attorney general that the president take disciplinary action.'' On his relationship with longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>: `` We must conclude that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in certain instances involving Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, either did not understand, or did not appreciate, or simply did not care what impression could be left with the public about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he oversaw.'' On dealing with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> on subjects as varied as <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline: `` The subjects varied, but a strong undercurent flows through a not insubstantial number of those communications and that undercurrent was Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s seeking action in matters in which he had a financial interest from Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> or his staff. Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> continued to accept these communications, gave no indication whatsoever that he was not receptive to them, and took them into account in various official actions. `` We have discovered no evidence that any other friend of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had a relationship remotely similar to that enjoyed by Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.'' Regarding the $ 1 billion proposed <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> oil pipeline, in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was representing Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, and dealings with then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>: `` In the pipeline matter, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew that his close friend had a financial interest in the project; nevertheless, he called Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> -LRB- which resulted in a meeting between <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> -RRB-. `` In addition, that call intentionally circumvented the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, and thereby initiated a sequence of events involving important foreign policy considerations without the participation of the principal foreign policy arm of the government. ... His call facilitated a private venture with enormous profit potential to private individuals, including Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s friend and creditor, Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>.''

 Private exporters have sold an additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at subsidized prices, almost cleaning out <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s current authorization under the program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of 1 million tons authorized Dec. 30 for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Under the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement, exporters can sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. Exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. The wheat sales were handled by two companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 115,000 tons, and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 85,000 tons. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 22.49 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel. Only 10,000 tons remain available to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the program, he said. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 200,000 tons of wheat would be about 7.34 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around $ 4.09 per bushel, according to recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market figures, making the new sale worth an estimated $ 30 million.

 Soldiers today dynamited the homes of three Palestinians suspected of injuring three Israelis with stones, marking a new get-tough policy against rock throwers in the occupied territories. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 17-year-old Palestinian was fatally shot in the stomach during a clash with troops, and a second teen-ager died of a gunshot wound to the heart suffered in a clash Jan. 7, hospital officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed one death and said it was checking the second report. Sixteen Palestinians were shot and wounded today in confrontations in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the reports said. Also today, some reserve soldiers complained to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of their role in the violence, saying they were forced to beat innocent people and betray <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> values in trying to put down the 13-month Palestinian uprising. The criticism came as <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visited an army tent camp outside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city. The soldiers said they routinely beat innocent people to instill fear in them and enforce order. Many said they were ashamed. `` When I get up in the morning, I say to myself, ` Now I have to go out and catch a man,' and I look at his hands and see he is a working man like myself. And I have to slap him or beat him murderous blows to get him to fear me,'' said a soldier who identified himself as <PERSON> Yotam </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Tiberias </LOCATION>. Today's housing demolitions drew immediate protests from left-wing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> groups. Five opposition parties filed a motion of no-confidence in the government to be debated by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the demolitions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kalkilya </LOCATION> were intended to stem an upsurge in violence. The army said two other houses in the town were sealed up. After the demolitions, soldiers dropped leaflets on the town from a helicopter. The leaflets said troops would destroy the homes of anyone caught stoning Israeli targets, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. The army said more Palestinians were wounded in the past month than in any other during the uprising, as soldiers responded to increased attacks and rioting. It said 26 Palestinians were killed and 492 wounded in the month ending Jan. 9. At least 361 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year rule of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The latest victim was <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Syam </PERSON> of Faraa refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. He was shot during a confrontation with troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. An army spokesman confirmed there was a clash in <LOCATION> Faraa </LOCATION> but said he had no reports of casualties. Today's other victim was <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> <PERSON> Taka </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasra </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, who died at a hospital in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a hospital official said. The army confirmed the death. <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said troops will be allowed to fire rubber and plastic bullets more liberally to quell riots, despite controversy over the ammunition following the recent deaths of four Arab youths hit by rubber bullets. `` Since stone-throwings have become a major nuisance we will use all the means at our disposal and everywhere _ strict punishments and deterrents _ so that the rebels, who consider these attacks to be legitimate, will understand that we will not tolerate them,'' <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` Lately we have widened our measures, including among other things, the use of plastic and rubber bullets,'' said <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, adding that they have been `` effective in confronting violence.'' Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman, said house demolitions would apply only to severe cases of rock-throwing that cause serious injury or damage. `` We are trying to signal that those throwing rocks and causing harm will pay a higher price,'' he said. The new crackdown will also involve heavier fines _ more than $ 1,000 _ on the parents of stone-throwers under age 14, <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. An army spokesman said the homes destroyed today belonged to a group of Palestinians suspected in several recent stoning attacks, including an assault on a vehicle Dec. 17 that injured three people. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said 15 people in the group were arrested, and the army said the suspects belonged to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> movement. The assaults were the first the army has blamed on Palestinians linked to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> since the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief renounced terrorism last month, a move that led <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to break its ban on official contacts with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Since the Palestinian uprising began, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has routinely destroyed the homes of suspects in serious assaults. Today's demolitions raised to 152 the number of homes wrecked during the uprising, according to army figures

<HEAD>Court To Review $181,000 Attorneys' Fee Award in Airline Sex Bias
Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case of particular interest to lawyers and civil rights activists, today agreed to review a $ 181,000 attorneys' fee award stemming from a 1970 airline sex bias lawsuit. The justices said they will decide whether people who intervene in civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue. The case stems from a 1970 suit that challenged the policy of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to fire female flight attendants when they became mothers. The policy was attacked as illegal sex discrimination barred by Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. A nine-year legal battle was resolved in 1979 when <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reinstate fired women with seniority from the date of their dismissal. The airline, which had abandoned its `` no-motherhood'' policy soon after the suit was filed, also created a $ 3 million fund for the fired attendants. The settlement was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants who could suffer from the lawsuit's settlement by being laid off in favor of those with the newly won seniority. The union acted as an intervenor in the suit, interjecting itself as a concerned third party rather than as either defendant or plaintiff. The union's challenge to the settlement proved unsuccessful, and last May the 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ordered the union to reimburse the women who won the suit $ 180,915 in legal fees. The appeals court noted that the union argued `` that because it intervened solely to assert the rights of its non-discriminating incumbent members, it should be viewed in practical terms as a plaintiff and hence assessed attorneys' fees only if it its opposition to the settlement was found to have been groundless.'' But the appeals court said the union's reasoning `` could substantially undermine'' a federal law aimed at giving citizens an incentive to challenge unlawful discrimination by assuring their legal costs will be reimbursed if they win. `` We are not inclined to look favorably upon such a potentially injurious exception to this long-standing legislative scheme,'' the appeals court said. The fact that the women who sued were awarded more than $ 1.25 million in legal fees from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> does not let the union off the hook, the appeals court added. In appealing to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the union said the 7th Circuit court ruling conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts. The union also said that it only was fulfilling its responsibility to its members when it challenged the settlement to the suit. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants were laid off beginning in October 1979 when a recession hit the airline industry, the union said. It said some would have been able to keep their jobs were it not for the settlement that awarded seniority to the fired women who sued <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. The high court's ruling in the case, expected by July, will affect numerous suits in which violations of civil and constitutional rights are alleged. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Zipes </PERSON>, 88-608.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Iran is `Limited' in Hostage Situation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s prime minister today said President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is working more to justify <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> than to free American hostages there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently indicated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could help free nine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held by Shiite Moslems believed loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> gave little encouragement. He said the hostage issue was an `` internal question of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' and his country `` is limited because it is a question of territory.'' <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> was asked at a news conference what <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> can do to help the hostages, in view of the impending change of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration. As for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said he believed `` he is, more than trying to work for the release, trying to justify his policy'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Iranian hinted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should rethink its policy toward <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but did not say what changes should be made. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> also maintained `` it's not clear who these groups are who take hostages'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Monday for talks to improve economic relations. The two-day visit was his first to a Western country since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed Aug. 20 to a cease-fire in their 8-year war. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the cease-fire `` has potential for amelioration of that hostage situation, but I think it would be improper to assume that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> controls a key to all these hostages.'' Still, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` it's in our interests to have better relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> also criticized an international declaration issued in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> last week on chemical weapons, saying `` People can still easily construct chemical arms.'' The declaration is not binding on the 149 nations that said they are against the use and spread of chemical arms. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s charges that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons during their war _ an allegation <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denies. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> left for an audience with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> that was the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leader's first with an official of the Islamic republic. The pope urged that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> exchange their 100,000 prisoners of war as soon as possible `` to alleviate the suffering of these men and to give back to so many families the joy of being together again,'' according to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. As the private audience went on in the pope's library, police dispersed about 30 supporters and opponents of the Iranian government who shoved each other and yelled insults in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square After 20 minutes of private talks, the pope publicly met <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s entourage and spoke briefly to <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadeq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalkhali </PERSON>, chairman of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs committee `` Our revolution is a religious revolution and we ask you to pray for peace in the world,'' <PERSON> Khalkhali </PERSON> said. `` That's what we're doing,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> responded. The Iranian continued, `` We know the world needs religious spirit and until there is religious spirit there will not be morality.'' The pope then offered his blessing to all Iranians, including `` those fallen in war.''

 A fishing boat hit a floating mine and exploded today in <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> waters northeast of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the skipper was killed. The agency quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement as saying another fishing boat picked up the boat's five crew members, who were injured in the blast, and took them to a <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> hospital. Rescuers also recovered the body of the skipper, identified as Bahraini national <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON>, the statement said. Drifting mines from the former Iran-Iraq war zone, torn from their moorings by winter storms, remain a hazard for shipping in the gulf. Up to 200 floating mines may be left from the war, mainly in the northern part of the waterway. About 20 mines have been neutralized since a cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. A floating mine was believed responsible for a Jan. 5 explosion that triggered a blaze aboard the 36,904-ton Saudi Arabian tanker <PERSON> Sagheera </PERSON> as it sailed into the gulf through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The blast killed the Greek master and the five other crew members of Greek and Sri Lankan nationality. The vessel split in two and sank.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> polished his inaugural address today, trying to make it shorter, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened the first confirmation hearing for his Cabinet and the capital was rehearsing ceremonies marking the change of power at the White House. Three days before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be sworn in as the 41st president, hotels were filling up with early arrivals from the 300,000 people expected to watch or take part in the five-day extravaganza. `` The mood is very upbeat,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the inaugural committee. `` Rehearsals are taking place all over town. Decorations are going up. Thousands of media people from all over the world are picking up their credentials'' to cover the inauguration. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, picked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be his secretary of state, went before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to testify about his nomination. Demonstrating bipartisan pride in a native son, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a Republican, and Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, sat alongside <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the witness table and urged that he be confirmed. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> testified that the first order of business for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the new administration is a `` meeting of our minds on how to proceed with a changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said, `` Our task is to arrange affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a more responsible, constructive Soviet policy will remain in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s interest. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not abandon the Contra resistance force opposing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing, expected to run two days, is the first for any member of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. The next round begins Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets on the nomination of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as labor secretary, and the <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hears testimony from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, chosen as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget director Other hearings will follow in quick order. None of the Cabinet nominees is expected to encounter much difficulty winning confirmation. `` They are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, and we wo n't have the rigid ideology of the first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` I am trying very hard to establish from our side an atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had no public appearances on his schedule today but was expected to announce his choices for some top jobs in his administration. Among those expected to be named was <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, to be deputy secretary of defense, the No. 2 post at the Pentagon. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> worked on his inaugural speech Monday but `` she had to go back to the drawing boards. They're trying to shorten it, edit it,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> `` He wants it short,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said, `` Something in the range of 15 minutes or less.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked more on the speech again today and planned a dress reheasal on Thursday using a TelePrompTer. <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, considered one of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s most talented speechwriters, wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention speech and also worked on the farewell television address delivered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last week. The inaugural festivities officially open on Wednesday with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, featuring fireworks and 21 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F14 fighter planes flying wingtip to wingtip. Tiny flashlights will be distributed to te first 40,000 people at the event, and they will be asked to flick them on to underscore <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign theme of `` a thousand points of light.'' A dress rehearsal of the opening pageant will be held today, complete with the flyover of jets. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his inauguration week Monday by paying tribute to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> at a breakfast for black supporters. `` We must not fail the nation he loved so much and gave his life for. I understand that five days before becoming president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Federal offices were closed for the national holiday commemorating King's birthday. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared to step into the limelight, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was spending a low-key week. His only event on today's schedule was the acceptance of an award from the <ORGANIZATION> Touchdown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a sports booster organization.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to set aside serial killer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s conviction and death sentence for murdering a 12-year-old girl in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> 11 years ago.

A federal court hearing in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> is scheduled for next Monday to determine whether <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was mentally competent when he stood trial for the sorority house killings. But <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials are under no legal obligation to postpone executing <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> pending any conclusion to that proceeding. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, whose case won national attention even before it was depicted in a television miniseries `` The Deliberate Stranger,'' previously has come within hours of being executed only to win postponement. Today's action marks the fourth time the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has considered a formal appeal filed in Bundy's behalf. One, rejected by the justices in 1986, was a 34-page document filed by <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law school dropout, in his own handwritting. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> argued that lower courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had been competent to stand trial in 1980. Referring to numerous incidents in which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> exhibited bizarre behavior during his trial for the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> murder, the appeal said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was mentally incompetent at the time. `` This court has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a -LRB- post-trial -RRB- hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a defendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of his competency when sufficient indicia arise at trial,'' the appeal said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a `` contemporary'' competency hearing. After the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1987 that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he had been mentally competent in 1980, a federal judge ruled that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been. The judge called <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> `` the most competent serial killer in the country at this time ... a diabolical genius.'' The 11th Circuit court then upheld the competency ruling, sparking the appeal acted on today. In other action today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>: _ Allowed anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's research that the groups say could link smoking to health hazards. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that allows public access to material compiled for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ Agreed to review a $ 181,000 attorneys' fee award stemming from a 1970 airline sex bias lawsuit. The justices said they will decide whether people who intervene in civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue. _ Ruled that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan that placed Democratsin control of the state's congressional delegation does not unlawfully discriminate against Republicans. By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the redistricting plan. Republicans had challenged it as an unconstitutional form of gerrymandering. _ Rejected a challenge to a state law exampting religiously affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety standards all other child-care centers must meet. The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law does not violate the constitutionally required separation of government and religion. _ Set aside a ruling that limited the access enjoyed by labor unions that represent federal government employees to the home addresses of all their members. The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling that requires federal agencies to give employees an opportunity to have their addresses withheld from their unions. The appeal in the <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> case also argued that his conviction for the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> murder was tainted by the `` uncorroborated, hypnotically developed testimony of an alleged eyewitness'' to the young girl's abduction and by ineffective legal help at trial. `` It is left to this court,'' the appeal said, `` to apply the Constitution to protect this unpopular petitioner to the same degree it protects all other criminal defendants.'' <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> disappeared from a junior high school on Feb. 9, 1978. Her body was found in an abandoned pig sty. Prosecutors said that on the night of Jan. 15, 1978, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> entered a Chi Omega sorority house on the <ORGANIZATION> FSU </ORGANIZATION> campus and attacked four coeds, killing two and seriously injuring two. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, attacked as they slept, were killed. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who oppose capital punishment under all circumstances, voted to overturn <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death sentence. The case is <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Dugger </PERSON>, 88-5881.

<TEXT>
 An early morning mudslide that `` looked like lava'' pushed a house 10 feet off its foundation Tuesday and forced authorities to evacuate 10 other homes, officials said. `` I've got chest-high mud in what used to be my back yard,'' said <PERSON> Robey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, whose $ 100,000 home was destroyed. The hill into which the house was built began shifting late Monday night for reasons still unclear Tuesday, but water from a broken main behind the house might have loosened the mud, said <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Safety Director <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolford </PERSON>. `` It was like a wall of mud,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fire chief out there said it looked like lava.'' Mud from the hill piled up against the back of the house and the pressure collapsed the basement, slowly pushing the house off its foundation and into the front yard, <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Kaufmans </ORGANIZATION> `` apparently heard the house making some unusual popping and cracking noises. They finally decided they should get out of there,'' he said. By the time authorities were called, 12:30 a.m., the house was off its foundation. Gas, water and electical lines had been severed, <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> said. As a precaution, authorities asked people living in the 10 other houses on the dead-end street to leave for a few hours. The Kaufmans are staying with neighbors, <ORGANIZATION> Wolford </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called today for a renewal of bipartisanship in foreign policy and a joint effort with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ensure that `` a more responsible, constructive policy'' emerges from the changes reshaping the Soviet system. `` Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on his nomination to take over the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was the first of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet choices to start then confirmation process. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not abandon the Contra rebels opposing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. `` We must stand by them until our mutual goals are achieved,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must insist on protection for human rights not only in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and other Central American nations as well. He said the premier task of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy must be make certain that the Soviets move toward positive changes. `` Our task is to arrange affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a more responsible, constructive Soviet policy will remain in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s interest,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Sketching a broad outline of the foreign policy goals of the incoming administration, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said experience has shown that a bipartisan foreign policy is an indispensable ingredient of success as the nation faces the problems and turmoil of an increasingly complex world. `` Bipartisanship does not mean that we must always agree,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` There are and always will be differences in approach and substance.'' `` But eventually we must proceed,'' he said. `` And when we do it is best that we do so together if we are to achieve the national interest.'' `` Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Bipartisanship ... is the lubricant that enables the branches of government to overcome their natural constitutionally designed friction, a friction that arises from our differences of perspectives and our different responsibilities.'' `` As a realist, I know we need bipartisanship to succeed,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` In order to succeed we must work together.'' The first order of business between the Republican administration and the Democratic-run <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he suggested, is a `` meeting of our minds on how to proceed with a changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> suggested that if that happens, conclusions will include the need to modernize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional and nuclear weapons, to set `` realistic and prudent standards'' for conventional arms control and to reach a common approach on the issue of loans and credits to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Realism forces us to be prudent,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` However fascinating the twists and turns of perestroika -LRB- economic restructuring -RRB- may be and however riveting the details of decline as reported in Soviet newspapers, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains a heavily armed superpower.'' `` The talk is different but the force structure and policies that support far-reaching interests and clients have not changed commensurately,'' the nominee said. `` Many of those policies and those clients are hostile to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values and threaten our interests. That's a reality.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposed a multi-step approach to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s new policies, among them: _ Continue to welcome reform and changes _ Recognize that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies and strength have contributed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s new sense of realism _ Continue to probe the Soviets on arms control, human rights, regional conflicts and overall relations _ Place additional emphasis on ending regional conflicts in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and `` not allow the rhetoric of restraint to become a substituter for restraint itself. _ Seek help from the Soviets in dealing with such global problems as drugs, terrorism and the environment and if it is not forthcoming, find out why As the hearings opened, many senators were hoping to learn in what areas of foreign policy the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will differ from the often ideologically rigid positions pursued by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in the last eight years. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a friend of the president-elect and pragmatic political ally of longstanding, may be hindered in his responses by his lack of direct foreign policy experience. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former chief of staff and secretary of the treasury, did obtain experience dealing with the world's financial leaders during his years at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term. He drew up the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan to deal with Latin American debt. The plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in return for economic restructuring. Some expect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison officer to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, will seek to set his administration's foreign policy direction himself, leaving <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to manage it. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> does, in fact, possess skill as a tactical policy manager and a clear ability to deal easily with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While senators will seek to learn exactly what <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will be asked to manage, some are dubious about obtaining concrete results, at least this early in the game. `` <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will duck every substantive question,'' was the flat prediction of one <ORGANIZATION> Democrtic </ORGANIZATION> staff member who helped plan the two days of confirmation hearings and who asked not to be identified by name. Still, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is almost certain to confirm <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, possibly before the end of the month. But before it does, lawmakers will seek <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s public agreement to consult widely with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as events and policies unfold and to link hands in a search for a bipartisan foreign policy.

<HEAD>Report Calls For Debt Renegotiation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Latin American nations must negotiate debt reduction agreements with commercial bank creditors or face a worsening economic situation that could lead to the return of military dictatorships in the region, a panel of experts said Tuesday. The negotiation recommendation was made in a report by the Inter-American Dialogue, a grouping of 66 prominent citizens from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Another key recommendation was for the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and leaders of other industrialized countries to actively encourage debt reduction agreements and to provide `` appropriate financial guarantees'' to support such initiatives. `` Six years after the debt crisis began, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> remains mired in depression,'' the group said in its 59-page report. `` Unemployment and underemployment are at record levels,'' it said. `` Wages have declined sharply _ by as much as 50 percent in some places. Average income per capita has fallen back to the level of 1978 and is not recovering.'' The report, `` The <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> in 1989: Consensus for Action,'' said the alternative for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to decisive action is a `` treadmill of austerity, stagnation and rising debt.'' It said the crisis could condemn <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to a long period of economic hardship and political turbulence.'' `` In some countries, civilian authorities may be forced to yield to military rule,'' thus reversing a strong trend over the past decade toward elected government, it said. The report also recommended that: _ The nations of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> revamp development strategies, restructure their economies and effectively integrate them in the world economy _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> address its own economic problems and join other industrial countries to reduce international financial imbalances, open world markets and sustain world growth _ The international financial institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, sharply step up lending to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, provided the debtor governments adhere to economic reform programs The co-chairmen of the report panel were <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Linowitz </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a negotiator of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties; and former Costa Rican President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON>. Also on the ideologically diverse panel were former presidents <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and numerous former cabinet ministers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The report listed the hemisphere's major debtors as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. They account for 85 percent of the region's debt. Since 1985, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt has been guided by the so-called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, named for former treasury secretary and now secretary of state-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The plan calls for increased lending by commercial banks to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in return for economic restructuring but lending levels since 1985 have been far below expectations. A month ago, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he will undertake a major review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward Third World debt because of the `` enormous problems'' facing <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the report called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end its diplomatic boycott of the Sandinista government and bilaterally negotiate mutual security arrangements. Saying `` there can be no double standard,'' the report also argued that <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> must `` desist from assisting insurgencies in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and elsewhere.'' On drug trafficking, the report said that action to reduce demand for narcotics `` must be given overriding emphasis'' in the struggle against drugs. `` As long as there is a demand for illicit drugs, supplies will find their way to it,'' the report said.

 Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in November and sales rose at the same pace, the government said Tuesday in a report that analysts said bodes well for the nation's economy in the new year The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said inventories held on shelves and backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 753.6 billion in November, while sales reached $ 503.8 billion. The matching 0.4 percent gains kept the ratio of inventories to sales at 1.50, meaning it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the November sales pace. When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the new report indicates that `` at least from the inventories point of view, we think the economy is in pretty good shape for continued growth in 1989.'' `` Oftentimes, before a recession, inventories tend to build up,'' he said. `` There's no evidence of any kind of excesses in inventories in the economy.'' The November increase in inventories followed a minuscule rise during October and a 0.9 percent jump in September. It was the 23rd straight month in which inventories had risen, but sales generally have kept pace. `` It looks like inventories closed out the year on a very lean note, which should be a positive sign in terms of growth in the first half of this year,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a forecaster in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` People remained somewhat skeptical about the durability of the recovery. They kept their inventories rather lean.'' The monthly increase in sales was down from a 1.3 percent increase in October and virtually unchanged sales activity in September. The November sales gain was led by a 0.9 percent rise at the retail level, followed by a 0.5 percent increase at the manufacturing level. These two gains offset a 0.4 percent decline in sales at the wholesale level. The government last week reported that retail sales in December rose a lackluster 0.2 percent. The increase in inventories was led by a 0.7 percent rise in retailers' inventories, followed by a 0.4 percent increase for manufacturers and virtually no change in wholesale stockpiles.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pleaded innocent today to federal charges of diverting millions of dollars in donations from his followers and using the money to support his lavish lifestyle. `` I pleaded not guilty to all charges,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said after the arraignment. `` I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> made no comment during the hearing, but defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to impose a gag order in the case. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> read parts of an interview published Jan. 2 in which retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who presided over the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy case, called the founder of the religious broadcasting empire a `` sawed-off little runt.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> as `` a thief.'' `` We ca n't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated with pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon. He's already gone overboard.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor handling the case, said the government was willing to agree to a gag order. However, she questioned <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' motives, saying prosecutors were concerned that his statements were part of a strategy to get a change of venue in the case. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> asked the attorneys to consult with each other over the next two days and present a draft of a gag order to him by Thursday. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> scheduled <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s trial for the February term of court, but set no specific date. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three of his former top aides at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, were indicted Dec. 5 after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s operation under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, 57, his former top deputy, each were charged with 24 counts of mail and wire fraud and with conspiracy. They were accused of conspiring to defraud <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> contributors to support their lavish lifestyles and of diverting more than $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for their personal use. Last week, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> waived his right to appear at today's arraignment and entered innocent pleas to all counts <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, another <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney, said he has heard speculation that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> may seek a separate trial. Also indicted last month were brothers <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. They entered innocent pleas Dec. 15 to charges of tax evasion and conspiring to impede the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> in tax collection. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> tentatively scheduled their trial for the February term. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s former personal aide, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s former interior decorator, were accused in a separate indictment Dec. 5 of using more than $ 1.1 million of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds for personal expenditures. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and the three other defendants were released on $ 50,000 unsecured bond on Dec. 15 by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who also imposed travel restrictions. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 after he admitted he had an affair with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paid her money to keep quiet. Three months later, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy law. Last month a Canadian businessman bought <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, including its Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fate of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s religious operations, which were spun off by the bankruptcy court into the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>, is unclear <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, began broadcasting `` The Jim and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' from their leased home near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> earlier this month.

 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> violated federal ethics standards by acting at the request of a close friend to assist scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a proposed $ 1 billion <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> oil pipeline, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report concluded today. `` There are three instances in which friendship'' between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` dictated government action,'' it said. If <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were still attorney general, `` we would recommend -LRB- to the next ranking department official -RRB- that the president take disciplinary action,'' the report said. A department statement said no further action against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is warranted because he is no longer a government employee. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> also found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated the executive order on ethics and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s own standards of conduct by failing to disclose the sale of stocks in his 1985 federal income tax return on a timely basis. The report also said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated ethics standards by participating in official matters involving the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> companies while he held some $ 14,000 in telecommunications stock. The report's findings on ethics questions are based in large measure on evidence gathered in a 14-month criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by an independent counsel. That probe did not address ethical questions and ended with a decision not to prosecute. In response, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers called the findings `` a travesty of justice.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes `` this report was unnecessary, partly because Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been in the office for some time and partly because it was unwarranted.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still believes his longtime friend did nothing wrong. `` That's the way he feels. I talked to him and I know whereof I speak,'' the spokesman said of the president. The report concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> engaged in `` conduct which should not be tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney general.'' `` As a direct result of the preferential, improper efforts of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff, the Army'' awarded a $ 32 million engine-building contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was counselor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the report. The next year, it said, `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff injected themselves ... as a direct result of the friendship between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'' into a financial problem <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was having with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. At the urging of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> tried to help clear up the problem <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was having by making a phone call to then-Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldrige </PERSON>, the report said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s intervention is `` precisely'' the type of activity that is prohibited by a federal executive order spelling out ethical standards for federal employees, it said. On the pipeline, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, again at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s urging, arranged a meeting in 1985 for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and his client, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, with then-White House national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that would support the project, the report said. `` We must conclude that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, in certain instances involving Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, either did not understand, or did not appreciate, or simply did not care what impression could be left with the public about his own integrity and the integrity of those functions he oversaw,'' the report said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said last July he had been `` completely vindicated'' by the decision of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> not to seek an indictment against him. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> found <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably violated federal conflict-of-interest and tax laws, but he said prosecution was not appropriate. `` We trust that this analysis will lay to rest the claims by Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether an independent counsel seeks an official's indictment,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` We found that the independent counsel's report far from vindicates Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>; rather, it details conduct which should not be tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The investigators said that if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were still attorney general, `` we would recommend -LRB- to the next ranking department official -RRB- that the president take disciplinary action.'' It did not specify what action would be appropriate. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that because <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is no longer associated with the department, no further disciplinary action is warranted in connection with matters raised in the report. In a statement, the department said Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has reviewed and accepted the report and considers the matter closed. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> addressed the portion of the report that found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had violated the executive order and the department's standards of conduct by participating in matters involving the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies while holding stock in them `` It appears to me that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failure to fully dispose of his financial interest in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies resulted from a failure to obtain or act upon adequate legal advice rather than an intent to violate ethical standards,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s accountant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>, suggested that no mention of the securities sales should be made on the tax return because the information necessary to detail the stock sales could not be located. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> finally filed the information early last year after a grand jury began looking into it as part of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. In a 16-page statement prepared in response to the report, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers contend that `` there is absolutely no basis for criticizing his conduct,'' and term the report `` a travesty of justice.'' The report said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s `` actions were inconsistent with the highest standards which the American people demand of not only every other attorney in the department, but especially the attorney general who must set the highest standard of behavior for the department and for the government.'' Contents of the 61-page report were first disclosed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in Tuesday editions. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> left the administration last summer to join two conservative research organizations.

<TEXT>
 Afghan soldiers used clubs and tree branches to flail cold, hungry people who nearly engulfed <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> troopers distributing emergency rations in this blockaded city Tuesday. The blockade by Moslem insurgents, who have fought the communist regime for a decade, has created acute shortages as the remaining 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the Feb. 15 deadline set in a U.N.-mediated agreement. A woman was pushed to the icy ground. An Afghan trooper with a rifle under his arm punched and kicked a group of teen-agers when the crowd of about 1,000 ignored repeated orders from the Soviet soldiers, shouting through megaphones, to move back. Some Afghan soldiers even swung blankets at men, women and children who broke from waiting lines and pressed toward Soviet armored personnel carriers that rolled into the rundown <LOCATION> Khairkhana </LOCATION> district near the airport with emergency supplies of fuel. Five Red Army soldiers in fur hats were in each personnel carrier, and they appeared ill at ease. Some sat staring at the crowd from their vehicles, which were armed with 75mm cannons pointed skyward, while others poured fuel into containers held up by people at the front of the line. Soviet soldiers made a similar distribution last week, but the small amounts will be of little help. `` I have nothing now, my house is cold, my children are hungry,'' said a woman who identified herself as <PERSON> Aziza </PERSON>, a 35-year-old mother of nine, and never got to the head of the line. A woman whose face was totally veiled, according to strict Moslem practice, held out her hands to a Western reporter and said: `` My children are hungry, I am hungry. This is because the rebels are not letting supplies in.'' Children as young as 8 joined lines waiting for bread outside shack-like private bakeries in other parts of the capital, shivering in predawn temperaturs far below freezing. Lines of buses and cars waiting for gasoline or diesel fuel stretched around entire blocks in downtown <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Western aid officials expressed alarm at the plight of malnourished children waiting for bread in frigid temperatures. They said the government wheat silo for supplying private bakeries, which holds 50,000 tons and usually has a 40 percent reserve, was virtually empty. Severe shortages began earlier this month when Soviet forces started pulling out of the city and handing over convoy stations on the <LOCATION> Solang </LOCATION> highway, the vital route north, to the government's unreliable conscript army A particuarly bitter winter exacerbates the lack of daily necessities. As the crowd struggled toward the Soviet supplies, giant Ilyushin-76 transport planes took off reguarly from the airport, a daily occurrence as the withdrawal deadline approaches. Afghans generally have been hostile to the Soviet presence during the long civil war, but some said Tuesday they wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to stay, if that meant getting some supplies. Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979 and began leaving May 15, 1988, under the withdrawal accord. They helped government forces combat the Moslem guerrillas who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978, and an estimated 115,000 were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the agreement was signed. No political settlement is in sight and the Soviets have promised to continue arming Afghan forces against the insurgents, who were not a party to the withdrawal agreement and have continued fighting. They are supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor Unconfirmed reports circulated Tuesday that the Afghan army, which usually gets its grain supplies from the Soviets, had been buying wheat on the private market. Food prices have more than doubled in four weeks. Flour has gone from 850 afghans, the national currency, for about 15 pounds to 1,700 afghans in a nation whose people earn an average of about 300 afghans a month. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar buys 50 afghans at the official rate and 200 on the black market flourishing in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s bazaars. An Afghan doctor said there were no more of the special ration coupons that protected government employees against previous shortages. <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, reported attendance at its health clinics down by nearly half because, mothers said, they and their children could not leave the food and fuel lines. `` This is not an African famine situations but it is a very bad situaton,'' said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, the Irishman in charge of the small <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> mission.

<TEXT>
 At a moment of standstill and silence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he can visualize a day of better relations _ a comment he hopes may help `` unlock the locks'' that bind nine American hostages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke in general terms, saying that a time of change in administrations also can be a time of change in troubled relationships abroad. `` I do n't start off with the view that we always have to be at loggerheads with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the president-elect said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also could take steps, beginning with the hostage impasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president on Friday, eight years almost to the hour from the release of the 52 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> hostages who were held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days and freed when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s final days as president were marked by intense, indirect negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of those captives. That history has given rise to speculation about the possible release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The militant Shi'ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> can control their fate. `` There was a lot of speculation back in October and November that the hostages might be freed, because of the parallel at the end of the Carter administration,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But he said there have been no openings and no negotiations like those eight years ago. Nor have there been talks on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s offer to pay compensation to the families of 290 people killed on July 3, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to present the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistaken for a warplane. At the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, he called it a ` terrible human tragedy,'' but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shares responsibility because the civilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules out paying a price for release of American hostages, on the ground that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens around the world will be put at risk.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On Friday <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> becomes the 32nd former president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, posing anew the question of how _ or whether _ the nation can use the experience of its former chief executives. The country has no formal structure for doing so, but former President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> thought he had an idea. In his memoirs, `` Mr. <PERSON> Citizen </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> proposed that former presidents be made non-voting `` Free members of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The former president, of course, could not be expected to sit still, just waiting to be called on for an expression of opinion,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> said. `` More often he would want to speak up on matters which he might deem necessary to bring to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Arguments and debate are what make a free government and a former president could be counted on to stimulate and even provoke debate,'' the former president said. It would, said <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, `` stop the waste of a vast storehouse of experince'' and, to some extent, `` help bridge a certain gap in the continuity of our government.'' Although <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s suggestion was never adopted, it was in marked contrast with the tongue-in-cheek proposal offered by former President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>. Ex-presidents, said the ex-president, should be chloroformed and ceremonially cremated immediately after leaving office. This, said <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, would `` fix his place in history and enable the public to pass on to new men and new measures.'' <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> ignored his own view, and instead had one of history's most distinguished and satisfying post-presidential careers, becoming chief justice. There were times, he remarked, when he could hardly remember ever having been president at all. Of course the first president to attach `` former'' to his title was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>. `` Perhaps the most important decision ever made concerning an ex-president was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision to become one,'' wrote <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiteclay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> magazine in 1979. `` Conceivably, he might have stayed in office until he died, establishing a far different tradition than the voluntary relinquishing of power.'' Ever since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> retired to the life of a gentleman farmer, former presidents have sometimes been called on for their expertise _ and sometimes ignored altogether. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> became a former president twice, having won the office for a second non-consecutive term after a four-year time out. Eight presidents died in office, never achieving the status of ex-president. The second president, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, became a virtual political exile. But his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Qunicy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, won election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> after his presidency and served 17 years. Three former presidents sought the presidency again and failed. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, determined to end 20 years of neglect, reached out to former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> twice, naming him first to get food to hungry people after World War II, then to head a commission that recommended ways to streamline the government. The Former Presidents Act of 1958 granted ex-presidents an annual income and authorized them to hire a staff and operate from a suite of offices furnished at government expense. It granted ex-presidents free mailing privileges. And it provided a pension for presidential widows. In 1963, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also granted former presidents transition funds to be used in the first six months after leaving office. After President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was assasinated in 1963, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted all former presidents Secret Service protection. And in 1969 a townhouse on <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> near the White House was set aside for the use of former presidents visiting the capital. Nearly all recent former presidents have written books, justifying their conduct in office or offering ideas and proposals. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> opened the first presidential library, and all of his successors have followed his example. All of this provides a base for sharing that wealth of experience of which <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> spoke. Several recent presidents have. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, struggling to emerge from the Watergate cloud that forced his resignation as president, has written several books of foreign policy advice. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has engaged in campaigns to improve world health and human rights conditions. Through his hands-on carpenter's work with Habitat for Humanity, he has campaigned for decent housing for the poor. He has also written several books, including one on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy. And this year <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, teaming with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, issued a detailed volume of advice to the next president, including the warning that there may be no other way to eliminate the federal budget deficit but to raise taxes.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At a moment of standstill and silence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he can visualize a day of better relations _ a comment he hopes may help `` unlock the locks'' that bind nine American hostages. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke in general terms, saying that a time of change in administrations also can be a time of change in troubled relationships abroad. `` I do n't start off with the view that we always have to be at loggerheads with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the president-elect said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also could take steps, beginning with the hostage impasse, to demonstrate a desire for better ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> becomes president on Friday, eight years almost to the hour from the release of the 52 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> hostages who were held in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days and freed when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s final days as president were marked by intense, indirect negotiations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the release of those captives. That history has given rise to speculation about the possible release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The militant Shi'ite Moslem kidnappers are aligned with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> can control their fate. `` There was a lot of speculation back in October and November that the hostages might be freed, because of the parallel at the end of the Carter administration,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But he said there have been no openings and no negotiations like those eight years ago. Nor have there been talks on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s offer to pay compensation to the families of 290 people killed on July 3, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to present the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case that the passenger plane was downed after being mistaken for a warplane. At the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, he called it a ` terrible human tragedy,'' but said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shares responsibility because the civilian plane was sent on a path over a warship engaged in combat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his high command intend to stand on a policy that rules out paying a price for release of American hostages, on the ground that if kidnapping is seen as a profitable venture, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens around the world will be put at risk. That was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policy, too, but the administration shipped arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to try to gain hostages' release. Three Americans were freed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during the arms deal period of 1985 and 1986.

 Most Americans believe there's enough romance in their lives, and they reject the theory that a child takes the romance out of marriage, according to a poll released Tuesday by Parents magazine. In a national survey of adults, 70 percent of respondents said they had enough romance in their lives. Twenty-three percent said they had too little romance, and an intriguing 3 percent claimed to have more than they could handle. As far as children and marriage, 57 percent termed it a myth that the combination kills romance. But 39 percent said they felt that when a child arrives, Cupid leaves. The telephone poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, was conducted in September and October. Sixty-five percent of the respondents were married.

Attorney and <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last weekend, said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader has agreed to address the group April 13 at its convention in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. However, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday refused to say whether <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> would be allowed to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that `` we have n't received a visa request yet. We will consider it very carefully. We wo n't say in advance what we'll do.'' Denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa could anger <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders who consider the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a key part of the push for peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Issuing the visa could anger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its supporters. `` There is a dilemma,'' said <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lachman </PERSON>, a former president of the Detroit chapter of the American <ORGANIZATION> Zionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Even as a supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, I can understand why the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> would want to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, and why it's completely appropriate to serve as an intermediary in the cause of peace. `` But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>? To deal with him on that basis is to legitimize him, who was a terrorist up until last month.'' Last November, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s application for a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, citing the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader's support of terrorism But in December, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to renew talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and endorsed <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The April speech would `` be recorded as an historic event in the relations between Americans of Arab descent and the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership,'' <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. `` The granting of a visa to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman will not only be a gesture of good will toward the 2 million Americans of Arab descent, but would also underline the new administration's commitment to resolving the <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict within the framework of free and open discussion of all parties.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahwal </PERSON>, chief of the group's <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office, said Monday the issuance of a visa would demonstrate the commitment of Arab-Americans to peace in the war-torn <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> -RRB- is an important figure to Palestinians, obviously, but to other Arab-Americans as well,'' <PERSON> Ahwal </PERSON> said.

 The long-delayed launch debuts of two new military space rockets, the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 and Titan 4, should occur within two months as the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> prepares for what could be the busiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday. The commander of the Eastern Space and <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2, carrying a pair of military navigation satellites, is set for liftoff Feb. 7, with the Titan 4, which will be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful unmanned rocket, to follow within a few weeks. <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls for seven <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2s, two commercial <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2s and one <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 1; two Titan 4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two commercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite, and six to eight submarine test launches of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missiles In addition, the missile center will support seven <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> space shuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23. The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since 1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987. But launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold down the total, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. `` With luck we could support that rate, but if we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> decided to build the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 and to greatly increase its Titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had been phasing out unmanned rockets and putting all launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. After Challenger, officials realized this was a mistake and they ordered expendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space. <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waiting for a rocket ride, as a result of the 32-month shuttle standdown after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan 34D for several months after back-to-back failures in 1885 and 1986. About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said. <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said the range may have problems supporting the schedule if there are delays in a lot of the missions. Citing the Trident 2 submarine launches, the first of which is scheduled in about two months, he said, `` If you have a Trident sub at sea, and it comes in here for demonstration firings, that's a lot of resources and involves a national defense commitment.'' In most cases, the Trident launch probably would have priority over all except the most critical defense satellite launches. The maiden launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 already has been delayed six months and the debut of the Titan 4 about five months by problems preparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads. Another problem, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said, could be a shortage of manpower to support launches. He said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100 skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group.

<HEAD>Roh: Wants To Work For Reunification Of Koreas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said Tuesday he wants to meet soon with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> to end 40 years of enmity between the nations. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is preparing a `` realistic'' proposal to reunite the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> by seeing <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as `` a partner that also seeks to solve this problem,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said at a wide-ranging news conference. The leaders of the nations have never met, and the two sides technically are still at war since a peace treaty was not signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> agreed Monday to a South Korean proposal that would allow their prime ministers to lead political and military talks on reducing tensions. Those talks would be the highest level of contact since the war. `` Besides clearing the way for trade and exchanges between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, I will realize inter-Korean summit talks in the near future and achieve epoch-making progress in resolving the Korean question,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. The president said recent developments indicated <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also wants reconciliation, but he could not give details on efforts to arrange a summit. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, outlining his administration's plans for 1989, said his government would continue trying to build democracy and ensure continued economic growth to raise living standards. But, he said, violent anti-government radicals threaten the nation's political stability. `` Radical fringes are attempting to overthrow our free society and democratic order through violence,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. `` Stern action will be taken to check violent activities intended to topple our democratic society.'' His warning was directed at dissidents and radical students who have mounted violent anti-government protests demanding the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government. The radicals, who claim <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is a front for military rule, have little public support and their protests often are small. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> appealed to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to foster political stability. He said the transition to democracy since the end of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s authoritarian government had exposed and aggravated many problems. `` Desires that have long been suppressed have erupted all at once. Discord and discontent among different social strata ... have been dredged up to expose the accumulated problems of our society,'' he said. The <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government has helped introduce broad democratic reforms since major anti-government protests in June 1987 forced the Chun government to agree to elections and brought an end to repression. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> also promised to continue <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s efforts to establish ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other communist nations. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their creation in 1948 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. The North invaded the South in 1950, starting the Korean War, and the sides have clashed repeatedly over the years. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty must remain until peace is achieved on the divided peninsula. Radicals demanded removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, who took office in February, said he will keep his election promise to hold a referendum on his performance. He said he will choose an `` appropriate'' time and method for the referendum. His government also was trying to investigate corruption and other abuses committed under <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s government, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said. But he repeated his opposition to punishing the former president, saying it would be `` political retaliation.'' <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general who took power with military backing in 1980, went into rural exile in November after apologizing to the nation for corruption and human-rights abuses during his rule. Several of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s relatives and former aides have been convicted or charged with embezzlement and other crimes. The opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is demanding that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> testify before lawmakers investigating misdeeds, but <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> is trying to block the demand.

 Newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> says she's not sure whether President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recent expression of interest in her request for a pardon means one will be forthcoming. `` I do n't know,'' she said during a brief interview Monday with The Advocate of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> at her <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> home. `` It's a little premature for anything like that. If he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- does n't approve it, it would go to the next administration.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the 1974 robbery of a bank. She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted her in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank heist. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was convicted of charges connected with the bank robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison. Her sentence was commuted by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and she was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who leaves office Friday, said Sunday that he had `` asked everybody to look into this for me.''

<HEAD>Bundy Facing Execution Tuesday After Losing High Court Appeal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, the serial killer called `` a diabolical genius'' by one judge, faces death in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair next week after losing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal Tuesday. The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected arguments that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, was mentally incompetent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slaying of a 12-year-old girl in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Within an hour of the high court's action, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would be executed Tuesday at 7 a.m. under a death warrant signed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has also received death sentences for the 1978 killings of two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority sisters who were beaten and strangled just three weeks before the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> murder. He has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearances of young women, most of them in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, whose case was depicted in a television miniseries named `` The Deliberate Stranger,'' previously has come within hours of being executed only to win postponement. Tuesday's order marked the fourth time the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has considered a formal appeal involving one of his convictions or death sentences. `` We hope justice can now be served in this case,'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said. After signing the death warrant, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> `` one of the most notorious killers in our nation's history'' who `` has used legal manueverings to dodge the electric chair for 10 years.'' `` Justice has been on hold for a decade,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said, `` and it's about time <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> paid for his crimes.'' But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers representing <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, said, `` We will seek to stay the execution, ... perhaps as early as tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said he planned to file an emergency appeal in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state court. `` If we do not win a stay in the state courts, I expect we will be back in federal court,'' he said, declining to disclose what legal theory would be advanced. In the appeal acted on Tuesday, lawyers for <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> argued that lower courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he had been competent to stand trial in 1980 for the 1978 killing of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. Referring to numerous incidents in which <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> exhibited bizarre behavior during his trial, the appeal maintained that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been mentally incompetent at the time. `` This court has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a -LRB- post-trial -RRB- hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a defendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of his competency when sufficient -LRB- indications -RRB- arise at trial,'' the appeal said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a `` contemporary'' competency hearing. A federal judge in 1986 ruled that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been competent in 1980, calling him `` the most competent serial killer in the country at this time ... a diabolical genius.'' The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the competency ruling. The <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> girl disappeared from a junior high school on Feb. 9, 1978. Her body was found in an abandoned pig sty. Prosecutors said that on the night of Jan. 15, 1978, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> entered a Chi Omega sorority house on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> campus and attacked four coeds, killing two and seriously injuring two. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, attacked as they slept, were killed. Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who oppose capital punishment under all circumstances, voted to overturn <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death sentence. In other matters Tuesday, the court: _ Turned down the appeals of four <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> death row inmates, including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ Ruled, by a 6-3 vote, that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan that placed Democrats in firm control of the state's congressional delegation is not an unlawful form of political gerrymandering _ Let stand a ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that allows anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's research that the groups say could link smoking to health _ Rejected a challenge to a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law exempting religiously affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety regulations all other child-care centers must meet

 At least 49 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials in the republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> have been fired or expelled from the party, some for fostering nationalism or blackmail, the party newspaper Pravda said Tuesday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, who heads a commission of the ruling Politburo charged with coordinating relief efforts from the Dec. 7 Armenian earthquake, was scheduled to attend a meeting of the Armenian party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. That body's Politburo has been reviewing the activities of Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in line with a Dec. 15 decree from the party's Moscow-based <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Ethnic tensions have been running high in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> since February, when activists launched their drive for the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian region that has been part of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. More than 60 people have been killed in riots and violence between Armenians, who are mostly Christians, and the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership rejected the Armenian demands, instead putting <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> under the direct control of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s decree directs party leaders in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to penalize officials who committed illegal acts in connection with the ethnic dispute. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said many high-ranking Armenian officials had fueled the strife by their indecisiveness, and implied they might have been involved in the annexation movement itself. In all 68 persons received rebukes from the Armenian party's Politburo, Pravda said In addition, 13 executives were expelled from party ranks, and 36 officials in the party, government, police and economic management were fired, Pravda said. The Armenian Politburo charged the officials with destabilizing the situation in the southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and kindling nationalist dissension through indecisiveness, passivity, and negligence, Pravda said. The paper also reported officials had violated citizens' constitutional rights by resorting to threats and blackmail It did not specify what acts had occurred. The Armenian Politburo singled out two local party bosses for negligence and the absence of political leadership that it said caused deaths and massive emigration of the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> population. The bureau recommended official rebukes for <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chshmarityan </PERSON> of the Stepanavansk region and <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananyan </PERSON> of the Idzhevansk region. According to Pravda, the bureau also recommended Armenian Education Minister <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhumyan </PERSON> be rebuked for not maintaining order in university classrooms. The Armenian Politburo also charged party officials with the task of penalizing communists `` who indulge in the estrangement of people by nationality, who allow extremist attacks or stir up nationalist hostilities.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday proposed a change in federal meat inspection regulations to allow importation of slaughtered livestock carcasses with certain tissues removed. Current regulations require imported cascasses of cattle, sheep, swine and goats to include internal tissues such as the pleura, peritoneum and body or portal lymph nodes to help inspectors spot disease or other abnormalities, said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 The nation's capital will be trying to cover a ragged image with its Sunday best when the nation turns its eyes this way for the inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said officers would be working to keep the streets clear of crime and vice while <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is full of visitors celebrating the installation of a new president. `` We're going to intensify our efforts to abate many of the nuisances throughout the city,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, specifically mentioning increased efforts against prostitution and drug sales. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s facade, with its historic monuments and powerful residents, has cracked lately. The festivities come at a time when the city is dismayed by its murder rate _ 371 slayings last year, mostly due to drug wars _ and embarrassed by its mayor, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, the subject of two investigations recently into his social ties with people who were the subjects of drug probes. `` Much has been said about the mayor and the city's image,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, the new president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. `` Obviously, in the short term, this does n't help -LRB- business in the district -RRB-.'' The federal government has provided the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with $ 2.3 million to pay for police and fire protection, medical and ambulance service, traffic control, supervision of construction of stands along the parade route, food inspection and issuance of `` official inaugural maps,'' according to <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of the Office of Emergency Preparedness. Ms. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the city had made no plans to shove its homeless residents out of sight. Estimates of their numbers run from 7,500 to twice that figure. `` There's nothing that can be done,'' she said. `` It -LRB- homelessness -RRB- is a problem in the city. They have a right to watch the parade just like everyone else.'' But homeless-rights activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violence </ORGANIZATION> operates a shelter three blocks from the inaugural parade route, said police usually force the homeless out of sight by threatening to drive them far from town and leave them there. `` It happened to me in 1980,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` I was homeless. Police came by about 5:30 in the morning and said, ` If you're not off this grate within half an hour, we'll take you somewhere and drop you off.' Most people realize what the police want. They want you to drop from sight. So you do.'' `` It's fairly common for homeless people to be hassled by police and by other officials on the street, told to move on, told that they're loitering, told that they are not to be there,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless. `` It's not an unusual experience for homeless people. And what happens around times like inauguration is that those kinds of methods are greatly stepped up.'' At inauguration time in January 1985, image issues took a back seat to the homeless population's welfare because the district was locked in a dangerous cold wave. City police denied any role in moving homeless people this year. About a dozen people, many of them homeless, demonstrate daily in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across from the White House. Most of that park will be used for media coverage of the inaugural events, according to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, but a section has been set aside for protesters. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said homelessness is n't a problem on the Capitol grounds, which encompass 180 acres of parks and congressional office buildings `` It's against the law to sleep in the Capitol grounds outdoors,'' <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, `` and homeless people are aware of that.''

 Five students were suspended for defying their principal's order to end an unauthorized tribute to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The students said they recited King's works in the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> lobby Monday because administrators failed to observe the civil rights leader's birthday with a student assembly or a day off. The five, who are white, also said the curriculum in the predominantly white school system in an affluent <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb does not include black history. There are only 10 blacks among the 840 high school students. `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> did not work just to give blacks their rights. He wanted freedom for all men,'' said <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON>, 17, a senior and one of the demonstrators. The high school observed Martin Luther King Day with a moment of silence at the beginning of the day, and administrators asked social studies teachers to mention King in each class, school district spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Tuesday. An estimated 15 students skipped their second-period class to assemble in the lobby for the King tribute. Principal <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Plutto </PERSON> took them into the auditorium and gave them a choice between returning to classes or accepting three-day, in-house suspensions, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The five students who rejected the principal's offer were suspended, she said. `` We were really trying to do our very best to ... kind of agree to disagree,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has postponed its final full-scale test of the redesigned space shuttle booster a third time, citing delays in the rocket's preparation. The test, the sixth and last to formally qualify major design features of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel rocket, had been originally set for Tuesday, then moved back to Wednesday and Thursday. `` The test is now set for Friday. There's no one main reason for that, just an accumulation of minor delays that put us back a day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. On the two earlier postponements, the company said engineers had requested more time to adequately chill the solid-fuel motor's 1.1 million pounds of propellant. While Friday's test is the last of six formal qualifying firings, the redesigned booster already has been successfully used on two shuttle launches Sept. 29 and Dec. 2. In both cases, the boosters performed without a hitch. <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said only five of the six scheduled test-firings, the last of which was held Aug. 18, were required prior to launch. The final test is to determine how the rocket performs with propellant cooled to 40 degrees Fahrenheit _ established by engineers as the lowest operating temperature for the redesigned booster, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> ordered the rocket redesigned after a presidential commission blamed a faulty seal on one of the Challenger's boosters for the spacecraft's Jan. 28, 1986, explosion that killed the seven people aboard.

 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today asked county prosecutors to investigate the conduct of a white policeman who was secretly filmed while he pushed an off-duty black policeman through a plate-glass window. `` We're certainly not happy to have an incident like this occurring, but we need all the information,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of the council's request for an investigation. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Livesay </PERSON>, an assisant <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney and head of the office's Special Investigations Division, will lead the probe, said district attorney spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. The black Hawthorne policeman, Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said he set up the self-styled `` sting'' in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to expose alleged police racism in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> news camera crew arranged to follow <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the sting Saturday night. The incident was broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s national news Monday night. `` We've never been able to come forth before with enough evidence -LRB- of alleged police racism -RRB-. Now, it is brought to your living room in living color,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. The police chief in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> declined to comment pending an investigation. City officials promised a thorough inquiry. `` We will pursue it aggressively,'' said <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Manager <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanklad </PERSON>. `` If there is evidence of brutality, we will act accordingly.'' Long Beach Mayor <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kell </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show this morning that he was disturbed by the videotape. `` I ... do not support racism or police brutality, nor do the vast majority of the citizens of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and we're a caring, thinking community and it disturbed us very much to see the tape,'' he said. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, has about 450,000 people, including a sizeable black population. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and a companion were driving through a high-crime area of the city when their car was pulled over and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got out. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> videotape shows a white officer attempting to search <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The officer unleashed a stream of profanity and roughed up <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> after he demanded to know why he was being searched. The incident renewed calls for a citizen board to review the Police Department. The idea first was debated last year amid allegations of police brutality. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s boss said the black officer was looking for trouble. `` I submit that if Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had stayed in the vehicle, as did the driver, this incident would not have occurred,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hawthorne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonebraker </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday. Since the incident apparently was timed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to coincide with the birthday of Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> the confrontation should be considered `` nothing short of timed sensationalism at the risk of serious injury to all of the parties involved,'' <PERSON> Stonebraker </PERSON> said. `` As a police chief,'' he added, `` I do not for one minute condone the unlawful use of force or police brutality.'' The 30-year-old <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has been on a stress-related disability leave from his Hawthorne job for 22 months, contends the incident is typical of a pattern of racism by white officers in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> alleges racist slurs and actions forced him from the <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> department. He has a disability lawsuit pending, has filed racism complaints against the department and conducted a similar personal sting operation against <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was riding as a passenger with <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a 30-year-old off-duty state corrections officer, when they were pulled over allegedly for straddling lanes, which they denied. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> got out after the car stopped and police approached. During an argument, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to face a building and put his hands behind his head. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complied, and moments later was pushed through a plate-glass store window. `` I'm all right. OK, no problem,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the videotape. Police booked <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for investigation of interfering with police and challenging a police officer. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was issued a traffic citation. `` The officer simply used violence,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday. `` I already cooperated and told him he could search me,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I had already had my hands up and was turned to the window and he slammed my face in it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received support at a Monday night ceremony in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> commemorating King's birthday. `` I'm deeply concerned since it strikes me as a period when police violence and excessive force is rampant,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley-Thomas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> chapter. `` I'm more so offended since the <ORGANIZATION> Hawthorne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has no jurisdiction, is making judgment.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he chose <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police because of complaints to the Police Misconduct Lawyer's <ORGANIZATION> Referral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> of the referral service said 50 misconduct complaints were filed with his group against the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> police. Of those, 27 were filed by minorities, and 24 of those involved confrontations with white officers.

 The big winners in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under its planned 50 percent pay raise would be members who already refuse to accept outside money, while the losers will be those who in the past earned the most in outside fees. The reason is simple mathematics. Those who declined outside income would receive the proposed $ 45,500 raise _ from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 _ without giving up anything in the tradeoff. But those who have been collecting outside fees would lose that income, offsetting a large chunk of the raise. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has proposed the 50 percent increase for 2,498 people _ members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, top federal executives and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members. The proposal would become effective automatically unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote it down by Feb. 8 _ something not likely to happen. Lawmakers favoring the increase, however, have said they would give up their outside fees if the raise goes through. To illustrate the winners and losers, consider the case of three-term Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> received $ 47,625 in outside fees in 1987 and kept $ 34,940, near the maximum he could retain under <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> would receive a $ 45,500 raise, but after taking into account the loss of his outside fees, he would be ahead by only $ 10,560. On the other hand, two-term Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., who takes no outside fees, would be $ 45,500 richer before taxes if he accepted the raise However, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said he would not accept the salary hike. Senators are permitted to keep outside fees totaling up to 40 percent of salary, a current cap of $ 35,800. Any amount over that figure goes to charity. House rules are different, allowing members to keep 30 percent of salary, or $ 26,850. The outside fees normally come from special interest groups seeking influence in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said acceptance of honoraria leaves `` a terrible appearance that somehow or other we're for sale. It's long overdue that we say no to special interest groups putting dollars in our pockets.'' As for the pay bonanza he would receive, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said it is n't justified `` There's just no way to justify this pay hike at this time,'' he said. `` We have a huge deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asking the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people for some shared sacrifice. You ca n't lead in that kind of an issue by taking a pay increase yourself.'' An official of the self-styled citizen's lobby, Common Cause, said the important issue is eliminating outside fees, not the size of the raise. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, Common Cause senior vice president, said, `` The issue is, we've got to get rid of this corrupt system. Special interest money should not be financing our public officials. We need to pay our public officials at an appropriate level.''

<HEAD>Small Harvest a Disappointment as Leadership Approaches Plenum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A dip in the Soviet grain harvest is a disappointment for President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as he prepares for agricultural reforms, and may affect food supplies and buying strategies, Western analysts said Tuesday. `` This really is a disappointment. Just for credibility's sake they have to improve grain production. It's not happening,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Soviet officials on Monday announced that the 1988 grain harvest was 195 million tons, less than the 210 million tons in each of the previous two years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to reform Soviet farm policy by encouraging workers on the collective and state farms that were formed forcibly in the 1930s to work in smaller groups. He wants to give them long-term leases that will allow them to consider themselves masters of the state-owned land and offer the opportunity to earn more money for harder work. A meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled for March to consider reform in the farm sector, which is characterized by indifference, low productivity, and large losses in transportation, storage and processing. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that three out of four potatoes harvested in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> go to waste. A smaller grain harvest also will require the Soviets to divert more of their hard currency earnings to buying food rather than new foreign technology to modernize industry. The harvests of 210 million tons of grain in each of the last two years were short of the targets of about 230 million tons, which Western experts considered unrealistic, but better than the average annual harvest of about 180 million tons in the first half of the decade. Even with a harvest the size of those in 1986 and 1987, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had to import millions of tons of grain to provide bread and pasta products for its population and feed for its cattle. The official press warned consumers last fall that the harvest would be lower this year, blaming drought that afflicted many of the grain-growing regions in 1988. The Western analyst, however, said the cold and rainy 1987 growing season had been even worse for grain. Experts said the shortfall would not affect the amount of bread in Soviet shops, which is one of the few items that is always plentiful. But it could affect meat and dairy products. A second expert said an increase had been noticed in the amount of veal offered for sale at farmers' markets, indicating more calves were being slaughtered, and that Soviet statistics indicated a slight drop in milk production. The experts agreed the appearance of more veal is a likely result of a shortage of cattle feed, but differed on whether it was grain or other feed elements such as sileage and hay that were in short supply. In any case, they said the dry 1988 weather was likely to increase the protein quality of the grain harvested, making it better for bread products. That would send the Soviets into the world market for more feed-quality grain. In a meeting at the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> late last week in preparation for the March plenary session, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told farm officials that bureaucrats and neighbors alike treat farmers who are trying to take advantage of his reforms like `` Rockefellers,'' and that laws were being written to protect them. `` Many people, especially the lazy, do n't like the fact that leasing is destroying the ethics and habits of the years of stagnation, when you could get a good salary no matter how you worked,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said.

 Drug companies are making record investments in research and development, but the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> lacks the resources to handle the wave of applications for new drug approvals, the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The trade group said the pharmaceutical industry spent $ 6.5 billion on research and development in 1988, about 18 percent more than the $ 5.5 billion industry spent in 1987. The industry also had record sales in 1988, the group said. A survey of its more than 100 members showed they had sales of $ 46.2 billion last year, about 11 percent higher than in 1987. The increase in research and development spending reflects, at least partly, higher costs due to inflation as well as the industry's move into chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, research for which is more complicated and more expensive, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>, president of the association. `` If research and development on chronic illnesses were easy, it would have been done and solved some time ago,'' he said. `` We're -LRB- now -RRB- taking on the diseases that have n't been cured or not adequately treated. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> last year approved 20 `` new molecular entities'' _ drugs that are chemically different from anything previously approved. Each was reviewed for an average 31 months by the agency before it was approved and made available for physicians to prescribe to their patients, the association said. That period is in addition to an average four years spent developing each drug. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> noted that the 1988 average was down from 32 months in 1987 and 34 months in 1986. The agency approved a total of 792 drugs last year _ including new drugs, generic drugs and drugs related to previously approved compounds. He also noted that the agency has expedited procedures for drugs used to treat cancer and AIDS. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said that with more money and staff and better facilities, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> could cut the time needed to review new drug applications to six months. The association supports <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and his efforts to streamline the approval process and make it more efficient, <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> said. Young also has sounded an alarm over the agency's finances. He said earlier this month that the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> needs more resources to keep up with the number of applications for new drug approvals, which he said is doubling every year. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed budget for fiscal 1990 would increase funds for drug reviews by imposing a user fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers in order to collect about $ 100 million next year. <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON> called the fee `` a tax on innovation'' and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject it.

 A third group claimed Tuesday it had kidnapped former Prime Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, and one of them demanded about $ 790,000 for his return, saying most of the ransom must go to the poor. Police had no clues Tuesday about the conflicting claims from the three groups in the Saturday abduction of the 69-year-old conservative politician and businessman. A parliamentary commission on Tuesday was to have begun investigating allegations that <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> accepted bribes when he was a defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. The proceedings were suspended because of his disappearance near his home in a posh <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> neighborhood. One of the groups, which called itself the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, is `` a corrupt person ... who has stolen large public funds for his own profit.'' The previously unknown group said in a letter it would put him before a `` People's Tribunal.'' Also on Tuesday, a man claiming to represent the left-wing terrorist Fighting Communist Cells said in a taped telephone message to a news agency that <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> would be killed in three days if four of its militants were not released from prison. The third claim of responsibility was made to a radio station in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The radio station said it received a call from a person purporting to represent the notorious leftist <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> terrorist group Direct Action. None of the groups offered proof they held <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Melchior </PERSON> <PERSON> Wathelet </PERSON> said investigators are sure of only three things: <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was the victim of a well-prepared but violent kidnapping; he felt threatened before he was abducted; and a ransom has been demanded. There actually were two claims from the group identifying itself as the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, one in telephone call and the other in letters sent to two newspapers demanding the $ 790,000 ransom. The letters demanded that two-thirds of the money come from <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>' political and business allies and be distributed to the poor through five relief agencies. The remaining third of the ransom would fund the brigade's program `` to motivate the people,'' the letters said The phone call, also purportedly from the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, and related by deputy prosecutor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandoren </PERSON>, said: `` You will never see him again. We will return him in small pieces.'' <PERSON> Wathelet </PERSON> said on national television that many unanswered questions remain. `` Anything is still possible as regards the -LRB- identity of the -RRB- kidnappers,'' he said.'' Officials have expressed concern about the health of <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, who needs daily medication for a heart ailment. He was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late 1978 until early 1979. In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for tax fraud as head of his meat packaging business. That conviction forced him to drop a bid to become mayor of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in October.

He and another man, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, both <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Pembroke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, allegedly held up to 20 people hostage while <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> demanded an investigation into alleged corruption and drug trafficking in local government. The siege ended when Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to establish a task force to investigate the allegations. He did so, but later said the panel found only `` rumors and gossip.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> were indicted by a <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury in December. The state charges were filed after the two were acquitted Oct. 14 on federal hostage-taking and firearms charges. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> shortly after the indictments were issued. He fled to the Onondaga Indian reservation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but was arrested off the reservation and is in an extradition battle.

<HEAD>Students Want Bush To Solve Drug Problem</HEAD>

 Drugs seem to have replaced nuclear war as the top concern of elementary school children. `` Please do something about the bad people who sell drugs to little children. Put them in jail,'' pleaded a third-grader from <LOCATION> Rosedale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, in one of more than 60,000 letters written to President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the invitation of <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a classroom newsweekly read by 5 million students. Three-quarters of the letters written by the children in grades three through six mentioned drugs as one of the country's biggest problems, said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON>, public relations director for <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. Four years ago, the magazine's young readers advised President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that nuclear war was their top worry. `` Our young readers today are more concerned about drugs, poverty, the homeless and pollution,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> publisher. One fourth-grader from <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, wrote: `` I think the most important issue in our country is drugs. It is killing people and teen-agers and it is also interfering with our health. If you went to the schools and educated the kids about drugs, it would help solve all the problems.' <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> plans to send 25 letters to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> along with a three-page sampling of excerpts from others. A fifth-grader from <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, wrote: `` I think you should see how much effect the war on drugs has on teen-agers. You should also try to get the kids who stopped using drugs to encourage other people to stop.'' `` If anyone gets caught selling drugs, they should be put in prison for five years _ child or adult,'' said a fifth-grader from <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. On poverty and the homeless, a fifth-grader from <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, wrote: `` There are a lot of people in this country without jobs and people that sleep on park benches <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does not seem like a very free country if we have people using garbage cans and boxes as a home.'' Other forums giving youngsters a chance to advise the president-elect also showed social issues are primary concerns. Tips about caring for the homeless, helping <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and feeding the world's starving people were in 900 letters sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from elementary and middle school pupils in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Products of the Election Day 1988 `` Tips for the President'' essay contest were presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> for delivery to the White House. <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 13, an eighth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> Hilltonia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alternative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said she was glad the whales off of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast were freed, but, `` How many people will freeze to death without shelter? Will you work as hard for the people as you did for the whales?'' Some kindergarten students in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> had more immediate concerns. `` If bad kids beat up good kids, the president should take them to their moms,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>. Perhaps the most enigmatic advice to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came from a boy named <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, who said: `` Be a woman, put sharks in cages and kill all bees in the world.''

 <PERSON> Charlitta </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>'s roots are in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and she is not going to let the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> close the inner-city church she attended as a girl without a fight. She is returning to <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, for herself and for future generations of black Catholics endangered by an archdiocesan plan to close as many as 55 city churches. `` When they become adults, all of their hope has been killed through things like this,'' said <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, who had attended another neighborhood church that is not scheduled for closing. `` That is why I was concerned about coming back to my roots.'' Our Lady of the Rosary is on a critical list of 25 parishes whose viability is under question; it has a year to meet criteria set by the archdiocese or it will meet the same fate as 30 churches already ordered closed by June. At least 12 of the 30 have filed appeals with Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>; nine have decided to accept the ruling and others were undecided, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> said. The churches have until Friday to appeal to the archdiocese. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> defends the closings as necessary to maintain 82 viable churches and to help end a `` plantation mentality,'' which he defined as white parish leaders running churches attended largely by blacks. But for many black Catholics, who represent 4 percent of the 1.5 million Catholics in the archdiocese, the church closing plan has showed them their place in the predominantly white church. `` Now that it has come down to economic strain ... with not a lot of employment money coming in, we are the last to be thought of,'' <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said Monday. Black Lay Catholics with a Vision, a group formed to fight the closings, said the diocese has angered blacks struggling to maintain the church in a city where 60 percent of the population is black. `` This is a time when they should be trying to build more churches, not close any down,'' said <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON>, co-chairwoman of the group. `` We are very angered by what supposedly has done us a favor.'' At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Whigham </PERSON> worries about what will happen to the poor when her parish and the soup kitchen it operates closes in June. `` A lot of people do n't believe in God. What is going to happen to them?'' she asked. `` They ca n't ... feel the love and warmth we give them'' at the church in affluent <LOCATION> Grosse </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> that St. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Neri </PERSON> is supposed to merge with. But a black auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese supports <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>. `` Nobody is taking their lives away from them,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` Our religion is a religion of hope. Those who purvey it as something else are being unfaithful.'' `` We have seen things, terrible things, we've seen profound changes,'' he said. `` And we can look at change in a positive way. The black community has that faith. And I think that's a gift.'' The church in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> is not alone. Msgr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said he thinks other cities that have seen large white <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> populations leave for the suburbs will have similar problems. `` You could say the church has no control over it,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. The Archdiocese of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> tried to deal with too few Catholics for too many parishes two decades ago when it established the Inter-parish <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwilling </PERSON> said. The corporation lets wealthier churches help older, poorer churches financially. However, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> recently warned that several urban churches were suffering financially. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardin </PERSON> issued a set of guidelines in 1987 to assist parishes in conducting a self-evaluation, said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarauskas </PERSON>, director of the office for research and planning for the archdiocese. <PERSON> Sarauskas </PERSON> said last year three black parishes, working together, consolidated, and he said 10 other mostly black parishes are undergoing a planning process that likely will result in some closings and consolidations. But some black Catholics in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> reject the official explanantions. `` How can you say you are going to better something and then take away the facility, the churches and the priests?'' <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> asked. And when the church pulls out, <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> wonders, what will be left behind. `` You can very well accept other organizations and businesses pulling away if even the church is leaving.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Tuesday to give states sweeping power to control child pornography by upholding a ban on nude depictions of children, even by a parent. `` It's clear that posing a child in a state of nudity can and does do harm,'' said Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` The child will experience shame, a fear of blackmail.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> appealed to the justices to reverse a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that threw out a state anti-pornography law on grounds it could make it a crime for parents to photograph their naked toddlers on the beach. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, picking up on that theme, asked <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> what is wrong with taking a picture of a naked infant on a bear rug _ a pose familiar to millions. `` Those pictures are lawful,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> replied. He said no prosecutor in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ever envisioned invoking the invalidated law to prevent that sort of activity. Some justices suggested they could dispose of the case without issuing a broad ruling, dealing with the constitutionality of the law, because <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has replaced the statute with a narrower law. The former law, enacted in 1982, made it a crime to encourage or permit a child under 18 `` to pose or be exhibited in a state of nudity'' for purposes of a photograph, picture or other `` visual reproduction,'' even for private, non-commercial use. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Legislature has since revised the law to make such activity illegal only if done with `` lascivious intent.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the new law might not be strong enough to protect children from sexual abuse. `` I can think of no obligation of the state that is more important,'' he said. He also said that while many states have laws against child pornography, he believed only <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> had passed statutes as tough as the one struck down in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> court ruling overturned the conviction of <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 40, of <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> for taking photographs in 1984 of his 14-year-old stepdaughter while she posed topless, clad only in a red scarf and bikini underwear on a bar in their home. Prosecutors said the girl later threw the photos in the woods and <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> made her retrieve them. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was arrested after the girl's mother went to police with the photos He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was paroled after two years. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> high court, by a 4-3 vote, said the law was too broad in restraining freedom of expression because it could make it a crime for a parent to take a snapshot of a `` naked one-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' lawyer, said Tuesday the state has not offered `` proof of serious harm to minors'' from posing in the nude. He said that the photographs at issue in the case are not pornographic and that the state was trying to outlaw `` an area of expression that is much a part of our culture.'' Some justices said the state does not have to prove harm to minors to outlaw such depictions. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> questioned whether freedom of expression was at stake at all when a state makes it a crime to photograph someone in the nude. `` I do n't think you're talking about the First Amendment'' even when one says parents should be free to photograph their naked infants on a bear rug, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> said. `` That's a question of whether the state can intrude on the parent-child relationship.'' The case is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 87-1651.

 Czechoslovak police drove crowds from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s main square with water cannons for a third day Tuesday, although no protest was being held, and 14 activists may be prosecuted, dissidents and witnesses said. Fourteen dissidents were detained Monday, including playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, whose works are banned. They had tried to lay flowers in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to honor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a 20-year-old student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest the Soviet-led invasion that ended the liberal `` Prague Spring'' in August 1968. A prosecutor told relatives <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the human rights group Charter 77, and <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON>, a Charter 77 spokesman, would stay in custody for an unspecified period, a dissident source said by telephone phone from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who was married Saturday, also was among the 14 arrested Monday along with <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON>, a former Charter 77 spokeswoman who met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Emigre sources said privately that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Martina </PERSON> were told their relatives would be charged under Article 156, Section A, of the criminal code, on obstructing the duty of a public official. The maximum jail sentence on conviction is six months. Whether charges would be pressed against any or all of the 14 was not clear, the informants said. Witnesses said police had at least four water cannons Tuesday and sprayed people in the square indiscriminately. About two dozen vans of police rushed into the square in what appeared to be a preventive measure, since no demonstration was being conducted. Except for several hundred young people, most of those in the square appeared to be people passing through on normal daily business, the witnesses said. The witnesses, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, said people ran from the square to keep from being drenched and it was quiet after about two hours, with police patrolling constantly. CTK, the official Czechoslovak news agency, said 91 people were detained Sunday at a rally of at least 5,000 people in <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s honor An emigre source said 89 were released later Sunday, but a dissident source in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> quoted one of those freed as saying the number detained appeared to be much higher than reported by the agency. No official comment was available on the numbers of people arrested or released. The home telephone of government spokesman <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> was not answered Tuesday. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter saw police beat several people at the Sunday rally. At least one man was so badly hurt that other demonstrators called for an ambulance. Several ambulances were seen rushing through the streets of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON>, an emigre publishing house in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said a 59-year-old suffered a skull fracture. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavan </PERSON> of <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> <PERSON> Press </PERSON> said it was not clear from his source whether the injury occurred Sunday or Monday, or whether the man was a demonstrator or bystander. Also among the 14 is <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternova </PERSON>, a former Charter 77 spokeswoman who met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last year in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After police cleared Wenceslas Square on Monday with tear gas and water cannon, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> carried a dispatch referring to `` groups of anti-state elements, organized under the pretext of an anniversary of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s suicide,'' who had `` attempted to continue Sunday's provocation. `` The provocateurs disrupted public order with their aggressive behavior even despite repeated appeals to disperse,'' the agency said.

He said he expects to use traditional Soviet food but will also introduce more European and American cuisine on Soviet flights. He said it was the first time the Soviets have arranged with a Western company for contracted food services in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> already has contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> to provide meals on its airplanes at several airports outside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vladimar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacharov </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> director general, said Soviet officials hope the new businesses will `` operate both efficiently and profitably.'' He said the Soviets made the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> because it was the only company with the capacity to serve the world's largest airline, which has flights to 3,600 Soviet and 100 foreign airports and more than 180 million passengers a year. Asked if the Soviet airline was currently serving meals on its flights, <PERSON> Nacharov </PERSON> said, `` Sometimes.'' <PERSON> Huntsman </PERSON> said the venture would mark the return of his company to food packaging after it sold off a company that designed McDonald's hamburger containers His company, in a separate joint agreement, is to make plastic food services products for <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, with a manufacturing and packaging operation at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport. <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which says it provides over 150 million meals a year to 150 airlines, said its <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> operation will be one of its biggest. The joint Soviet-Marriott company is called <ORGANIZATION> Aeromar </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, and is 51 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> and 49 percent by <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>. The operations are expected to begin this summer. Both <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Huntsman </PERSON> said they were looking into other business ventures in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> said a team from his company would evaluate the feasibility of a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> hotel. <PERSON> Huntsman </PERSON> said his company was evaluating a major petrochemical project in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Huntsman </PERSON>, interviewed after the news conference, said `` some eyebrows might be raised'' in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> over the fact that it took the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to bring `` two Mormon boys'' together in business. Though he and <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>, who also has family roots in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, are longtime friends, they have not taken part in such a business deal before.

<HEAD>Report Finds Consensus on Need for START Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is general agreement in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and among foreign policy experts that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should complete a U.S.-Soviet treaty on strategic arms, negotiate reductions in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and eliminate chemical weapons, says a report released Tuesday. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Annapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a bipartisan think tank of politicians and policy experts, said the incoming administration's top foreign policy priority should be the START treaty for reducing strategic arms The group also found overall support for retaining senior arms control negotiators <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, negotiating reductions in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elimination of chemical weapons, and continuing Star Wars research at about current funding levels. More than 125 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, current and former administration officials and foreign policy experts were interviewed for the project, and the group said the report represented a consensus of views. During a six-month period, the group questioned among others, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Will </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan.; and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for national security The report said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will likely want to avoid `` conveying any sense of haste or urgency about completion of the START negotiation.'' `` A sense of haste would be clearly counterproductive, not only in terms of getting the best possible deal from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but in terms of securing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consent to ratification as well,'' it said. But the report stressed the importance of continuing START negotiations and talks on conventional forces and chemical weapons, noting that `` these efforts will advance your other interests in modernizing our strategic forces and in developing a strategic defense.'' The START talks have been recessed since November. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last month it was unlikely his new administration would be ready with proposals for the Feb. 15 date set by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for continuation of the talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. On conventional forces, the members of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations agreed this past week in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to begin new talks starting in March.

<TEXT>
 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government is mired in the biggest controversy of his six-year leadership over allegations that West German companies helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a chemical plant that can produce poison gas. Even members of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> say privately he has bungled the issue and threatened the party's popularity by dodging the question of whether he or his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members ignored early reports of a German hand in the Libyan project. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief aide is to appear before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to disclose new information about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations that West German firms took part in the Libyan project by selling materials in violation of export controls. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, demanding the `` whole truth'' be told, accused <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of inflicting lasting damage to the nation's image and to relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called on the chancellor to resign. `` We're making complete fools of ourselves,'' commented a government official from the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The chancellor must extricate the government from this controversy before the damage becomes irreparable.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has been silent on the subject since Thursday, when he acknowledged during a TV interview there were `` growing indications'' of West German involvement in the Libyan affair. After several denials of government involvement, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON>, refused to say Tuesday whether <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> now accepts <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that the plant near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> is capable of producing chemical weapons `` We have no new information on this,'' <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> told reporters. But on Monday, Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told reporters the government now has `` concrete indications'' and intelligence reports that make clear the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, southeast of the Libyan capital, can produce chemical weapons. `` We must assume that the factory is a facility in which poison gas can be produced,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said at a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karl-Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Driesch </PERSON>, sitting three seats away from <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> at the conference, said <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> had information from a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week that had not been seen by officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> said the government's position would be explained on Wednesday, when the chancellor's chief of staff, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, informs the Bundestag about what it knows of West German involvement. Opposition parties have and pressed the chancellor to clarify to what degree West German firms have been involved, including one company owned by the federal government. National newspapers have been critical of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s handling of the affair, describing the government as defensive in its stubborn refrain that it has collected no evidence that would justify criminal charges against any German companies. <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Sueddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> commented Tuesday that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had lost political control of the affair by evading action and suggested the government at least ask federal prosecutors to decide if charges are in order. <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of personal responsibility for a situation in which `` the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people and the world public have long been decieved, that German-American relations have been seriously hampered and that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been exposed to worldwide suspicion of calling publicly for a ban on chemical weapons while secretly fostering their production.'' <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, leader of the Greens party's parliamentary delegation, demanded that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> resign over the government's mishandling of the issue <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> told reporters in early January that the government learned of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims that West German firms helped build the Libyan plant during <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Nov. 15 visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Eight days later, after West German media claimed intelligence sources had informed the chancellor's office as long ago as 1986 of apparent complicity, <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> corrected himself to say the first word <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> got of the affair came in mid-October. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said Monday that his office learned of `` vague'' indications in August, and <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> confirmed Tuesday that an intelligence report had been made to the government on Aug. 2. What is seen by Americans as foot-dragging by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> poses a potential threat to the strong position <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party has in West German politics. If West German firms are found to have broken the law <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government could appear to have tried to cover up for the companies, or been slow to follow up on the American intelligence reports

<HEAD>Peasants Risk Lives Racing Trucks of Grain Across Province Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of peasants are running truckloads of grain across a provincial border in east <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at breakneck speed in the dead of night to get top prices, a state newspaper said Tuesday. The Peasants Daily said in a front-page story that grain-running across <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> provincial border into more prosperous neighboring provinces is dangerous but profitable because of low prices inside <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>. Officials in the border region have tried to prevent the grain outflow by setting up checkpoints to stop trucks. But the paper said most trucks barrel past the checkpoints and elude pursuers in chases that have resulted in at least one death. The paper criticized <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>'s low grain prices and its checkpoints and warned such policies would only dampen peasants' enthusiasm for planting grain at a time when grain harvests already are falling behind population growth. In one accident along what it called the `` blood-stained grain road,'' a 19-year-old youth driving a grain-laden truck lost control and crashed as he tried to speed past one checkpoint. He was killed. A few days earlier, a checkpoint official who chased a speeding truck leaped onto its running board and punched his fist through the window to force the driver to stop. The driver did not stop, but the official suffered cuts and had to undergo surgery, the paper said. `` The grain truckers who make these death-defying dashes are lured by the high prices'' outside <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>, it wrote. `` After a three-mile dash, they can earn more than $ 270 for their load, but if they are stopped at the checkpoint they are fined $ 810. Who would n't risk his life? Peasants must sell a fixed portion of their harvests directly to the state but supppsedly are allowed to sell the rest on the open market in any province. Officials in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>, however, feared all the grain would flow to neighboring <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION>, where higher prices are offered. The going price in <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> after the autumn harvest was 12 cents a pound of unhusked rice, compared with 9.6 cents a pound in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> border area. The relatively wealthy provinces of <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> to the southeast offer even more, the paper said. Both provinces have prosperous industrial and export sectors and generally attract much of the region's grain because of the high prices they can offer. Unhappy with <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>'s low prices, many peasants have withheld from sale an estimated 300,000 tons of grain. The paper noted this means they will have less ready cash for investing in next year's crop. It did not comment on the impact on grain supplies, which are short in many parts of the country because of a poor harvest. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> harvested less than 393 million tons of rice, wheat and other grains in 1988, down from nearly 403 million tons in 1987.

 Latin aliens in an out-of-control influx, streaming into makeshift quarters. The smoke of civil rage curling out of a predominantly black neighborhood. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s twin crises. While the dozens of Nicaraguan refugees arriving daily and racial disturbances in the city's <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> area had the Super Bowl host city's promoters fretting about <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s image, community leaders were more concerned with the threat of ethnic divisions. For some leaders, particularly those in the black community, there were disturbing similarities to 1980, when the <ORGANIZATION> Mariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boatlift </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmed <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> with 100,000 Cuban refugees and racial tensions twice flared into violence in black neighborhoods. Tensions were simmering among some blacks over perceived unjust treatment from police and feelings of frustration over perceived uneven treatment given the Nicaraguans, community leaders said. The hoopla over Super Bowl, with the city showing off its new skyline, new bayside attractions and improved image may have added to disaffection, and the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by police Monday evening provided the spark, they said. `` There have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks. They just needed a catalyst,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>. `` These people involved could care less about the Super Bowl being here. It's not going to help their lives.'' `` It's really close to what happened before in 1980,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, long-time publisher of the black-oriented newspaper The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. His newspaper in recent weeks reported complaints that police were being particularly violent with blacks, while resentment was rising over the influx of Nicaraguans, coming here by bus at 200 a day. `` This incident is unfortunate,'' <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON> said of the shooting, adding: `` There's reaction from the influx of Nicaraguan refugees, these people coming in and getting jobs that a lot of young blacks claim are not open to them.'' In late April 1980, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> opened the Port of Mariel to boats from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and some 125,000 Cubans arrived in less than five months. Placed initially in tent cities, most settled in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. On May 18 that year, the acquittal of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police officers charged with beating a black motorcyclist to death sparked three days of riots that claimed 18 lives and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. Less than two months later, more racial disturbances flared for three days after an incident between police and blacks. Three more days of violent disturbances erupted in December 1982 after police fatally shot a black youth, and street violence flared again when the Cuban-born officer was acquitted of manslaughter in that case. More than 200 arrests were made. As in 1980, when some blacks felt the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> community, whose largest ethnic group now is the Cubans with one-third of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s population, was making a special effort to welcome the Mariel refugees, some blacks are now resenting what they see as open-arms treatment for Nicaraguans refugees being housed at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> baseball stadium and other community shelters. `` The African-Americans have felt cheated,'' said <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>. `` We felt we were losing our place in the city.'' <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, a fiery leader in the Haitian community that numbers some 100,000 in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ about the same as the Nicaraguan exile community _ said the Nicaraguan influx underlines what he calls racist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treatment of Haitians. Since 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols have intercepted Haitians immigration authorities say are coming here for economic, not political, reasons. `` They interdict the Haitians at sea ... and they meanwhile offer the red-carpet treatment to Nicaraguans,'' <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Cuban-born mayor, expressed disappointment over the violence, while saying its Super Bowl week timing was n't his biggest worry now `` Obviously, any incident of this sort affects <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s image,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` The timing is always bad.'' The second-term mayor said he had been trying to ease <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>'s problems `` That's also the area in which the city has been making its greatest effort with the largest urban renewal project, affordable housing, possibly in the entire nation,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. Others say the city could do more. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who was on a 1980 commission that studied the riot aftermath, noted that county voters last year rejected a proposal for a juvenile welfare board aimed at helping black youths stay in school or get jobs. `` The young black males are the ones you see involved in this. Those are the people you would have reached,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` The answers are there. Unfortunately, 1980 has been too far away for some people to care about anymore.''

<HEAD>Department Will Reserve Summer Jobs for Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that for the first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for students from 17 historically black universities. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said 563 of the 1989 summer jobs will be held aside as part of the department's effort `` to increase the number of minorty students in agriculture, forestry and home economics'' and to seek careers in those fields. Last year 17,753 students nationwide worked during the summer months for various <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies, and officials said they expect about that many this year. The 563 jobs reserved for the black schools would represent about 3 percent of the total. `` Agriculture is more than crop and livestock production,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` Animal and plant sciences, economics, forestry, marketing and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in agriculture today.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the jobs will be with 19 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies and will be located nationwide. He said interested students at 17 institutions should contact unversity placement offices before March 1. The universities, collectively known as 1890 institutions because of land-grant legislation that year, are being targeted in other ways by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. On Dec. 29, the department announced it was establishing offices at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in agriculture. Also, on Jan. 9, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposed a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> budget for next year that included $ 80.2 million for new and expanded programs to increase the teaching, recruitment and research capabilities at the 1890 schools, a 20 percent increase from the current level.

<HEAD>Cave Paintings Stolen From Famous Buddhist Shrine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thieves cut a 700-year-old fresco from the wall of one of northwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s famous <LOCATION> Dunhuang </LOCATION> caves, one-time <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> shrines filled with magnificent paintings and statues, the People's Daily reported Tuesday The theft, from a cave that was not open to the public, was discovered Friday, the paper said. The thieves cut the 10-square-foot fresco into five pieces for easy removal, but one piece broke, the report said. The report did not describe the painting or comment on how the thieves got into the cave. It said a fresco also was stolen from <LOCATION> Dunhuang </LOCATION> in 1986 and the thieves have not been found. In the fourth century, monks who first introduced Buddhism to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> opened cave temples in <LOCATION> Dunhuang </LOCATION>, along ancient trading routes in what is now <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> province. Over the next few centuries, hundreds of caves were dug out of the arid hillsides of <LOCATION> Dunhuang </LOCATION> and their walls covered with religious murals. When the trade routes fell into disuse, the caves were abandoned and forgotten. They were rediscovered in about 1900 and found to contain thousands of priceless manuscripts and terra cotta statues. Only a few dozen of the caves are open to the public now as a tourist attraction.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> criticized four East European nations Tuesday about human rights and said `` dark areas remain'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but an aide reported Kremlin assurances of improvement. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said a ranking member of the Soviet delegation to the 35-nation <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> review conference told him during <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s last mission abroad `` the whole process will move ahead'' during the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. According to the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, the Soviet delegate said the cases of 20 more Jews who want to emigrate have been resolved and relatives of citizens who apply for exit visas no longer will be urged to object. Family objections have been used by Soviet authorities to reject applications. `` I really believe them,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` All these things are being volunteered.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> praised the Soviets and two East European allies, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, for taking steps to implement the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreements on European security and cooperation. He called Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` strong and creative,'' and credited him with improving human rights. Signed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreemenrference late last year. At a news conference, he called for the destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, built in 1961 to keep East Germans from fleeing to the West. `` There has been tremendous progress but the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall remains, as a symbol of the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, an inhumane structure and something that functionally separates people,'' he said. `` So, in the end that sort of thing has to come down.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for reserving the right to select which provisions of Sunday's declaration it would observe, although he had not done so in his address. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> told delegates Sunday, before adoption of the final document, that it would not honor provisions on greater religious freedom and emigration. One provision of the document is a mandate for new negotiations, scheduled to begin March 9, on reducing conventional military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I have some genuine optimism about the prospects,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. His last trip as secretary of state was one of the shortest. He was in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for 32 hours, then flew home to prepare to relinquish his office Friday.

 A revised law will prevent the main government intelligence agency from engaging in political activity, the agency's chief said Tuesday.

The Agency for National Security, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, has been a target of public criticism for its active involvement in politics.

<TEXT>
 Police cordoned off a largely black neighborhood today after a six-hour melee of shooting, burning and rock-throwing that was touched off by the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a white policeman. Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> declared the situation in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood under control this morning and called for an investigation. `` There was a tranquility in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> this morning,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The people know we are working toward finding out the truth.'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said he found nothing to substantiate claims by some members of the black community that the unrest was caused by resentment over the waves of Nicaraguan immigrants coming to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He said he planned no curfew. `` We're looking to normalize everything and keep police presence as unobtrusive as possible,'' he said. Police surrounded the neighborhood today and allowed only those with legitimate business into the area, said a police spokesman, Officer <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON>. Schools in the neighborhood were closed. In the only incident of violence reported by police Tuesday afternoon, a white man driving through the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> area reportedly began shooting into a crowd of blacks, injuring one person before driving away. The riot erupted on the night of the federal holiday for slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and as national attention was focused on the city as the host of Sunday's Super Bowl. It also rekindled memories of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> riots in the early 1980s. `` It just exploded,'' said City Commissioner <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as she prepared to enter the 1 -LCB- - square-mile area with a police escort `` People have been celebrating <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday all day. Maybe they were drunk. We just do n't know.'' The riot began about 8 p.m., about two hours after the death of motorcyclist <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 21, was shot in the head as he was being chased for an alleged traffic violation, said Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>, another police spokesman. Police Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said the department was investigating unsubstantiated reports that the men may have been involved in a robbery. At least two officers were pursuing the motorcyclist for alleged erratic driving when they passed a third officer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who was stopped by the side of the road in an unrelated incident, police said. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, who is white, shot <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> as the motorcycle came toward him, said Assistant Police Chief Don March. The motorcycle crashed into a moving car, seriously injuring <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s 24-year-old brother, who was a passenger. The brother, whose name was not immediately released, was in critical condition today, according to <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> officials. Police said <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> was temporarily taken off duty. The Dade County Medical Examiner's office issued a statement today confirming that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was killed by the gunshot, not by the crash. Within minutes of the shooting, at least 100 blacks began throwing rocks and bottles at police, who called for reinforcements. About 125 officers cordoned off the area, authorities said. Four people, including one police officer, were treated for cuts and minor injuries, said <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>. At one point, the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> approached the crowd in an effort at concilation but was driven back by rocks and bottles. An auto parts store was burned to the ground after firefighters were shot at and had to leave the area, <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said. During the height of the violence, tear gas was used to disperse some crowds, who attacked and burned several clearly marked news media cars. WCIX-TV reporter <PERSON> Lourdes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz-Toledo </PERSON> said she feared for her life. `` All of a sudden they threw a big huge rock right on the side of the driver. I blocked it with my elbow. They were yelling ` Get that white woman out of the car!''' the 27-year-old reporter said. Miss Ruiz-Toledo, who had stayed in her car while two colleagues got out, said she drove a block and was rescued by an officer who led her from the car behind a plastic riot shield. The car was later burned. A woman driving home from work said her windshield was shattered by a 5-pound concrete block. `` I had no idea it was going on,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` There were about 20 kids all throwing things. I did n't see any cops around there.'' Some blacks say they have been frustrated since <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officials began providing free shelter for about 250 Nicaraguans seeking political asylum. `` They feel that other folks are being recognized and getting a piece of the pie but things are different for them. They feel they do n't have nothing and what do they have to lose?'' said <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who had organized a parade in King's honor that drew an estimated 100,000 people of all races in nearby <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Of all days, I did n't want this to happen,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who was among black community leaders called in by city officials to help calm the crowd. No damage estimates were available. Some looting and gunfire continued in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> early today. During three days of rioting in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> in 1982, arsonists torched buildings and mobs broke into stores, causing millions of dollars of damage. The riot was sparked by the fatal shooting of a black man by a Cuban-born police officer. The officer was acquitted of manslaughter charges in March 1984, sparking another disturbance that resulted in more than 200 arrests and several injuries. A police internal affairs report in 1985 concluded that the officer was justified in using deadly force. In 1980, racial violence in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> left 18 people dead, 400 injured and $ 100 million in damage. That rioting occurred after an all-white jury acquitted several police officers of manslaughter in the beating death of a black businessman. The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON> in north <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the site of the Super Bowl. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> are staying less than a mile away at the Omni Hotel. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has a game scheduled for tonight, is on the edge of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 530,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a pact now in its sixth year. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment in January, February and March. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the Soviets have 670,200 tons still available under the program. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31, 1990. With the latest sales, the Soviets have bought about 1.3 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized, totaled slightly more than 9 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 530,000 tons of wheat would be about 19.5 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $ 4 per bushel, according to recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market figures, making the new sale worth an estimated $ 78 million. Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsizied. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 23.35 per ton, or about 64 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on the 530,000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 80,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000; <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000.

<TEXT>
 The prosecutor in the <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> soccer riots trial demanded Tuesday that two Belgian police officials be convicted for failing to maintain security at the 1985 European Champions' Cup match. Prosecutor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> was more lenient with two city officials and two top <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer officials who were sued by relatives of the 39 people who died and hundreds who were injured in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s worst soccer riot They should not be punished, he said. On Wednesday Erauw is expected to call for severe sentences for 26 British suspects who face up to 10 years imprisonment on involuntary manslaughter charges of instigating the riot before the May 29, 1985, final between <ORGANIZATION> FC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty of the 26 Britons returned to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> this week for a mandatory appearance during <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON>'s final arguments. They probably will be allowed to return home to await the end of the trial, expected in March. On Monday, <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Belgian soccer federation at the time of the tragedy, should be blamed for poorly organizing the match. On Tuesday, he accused state police officials <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensier </PERSON> of poorly organizing security at the match and not taking sufficient action to halt the riot. He was particularly harsh on <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON>, who was responsible for security in the stands where the riots occurred. `` Whatever, punish <PERSON> Kensier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON> for what they did, or rather for what they did n't do,'' <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> told the court. But he did not call for punishment of <PERSON> Herve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brouhon </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> city, which owns the stadium. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, chairman and secretary-general of the ruling body of European soccer also were not accused. Just before the match at the <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans charged into an adjacent stand of Italian supporters, and 39 people were trampled to death in the ensuing panic. Almost 500 were injured. <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> is expected to end his final arguments Wednesday. The British suspects were extradited to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> after being identified from video footage and photographs. The extradition was exceptional and indicated <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s resolve to stamp out soccer hooliganism.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pleaded innocent Tuesday to federal charges that he diverted millions of dollars from his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television audience for personal use. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> during the hearing for a gag order for all parties involved, based largely on comments by the retired federal bankruptcy judge who supervised the sale of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> assets. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he would consider the request, instructing attorneys from both sides to draft a consent order and present it to him by Thursday for approval. The magistrate told <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> he was concerned <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would go on television and talk about the case, but he issued no formal request for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to keep quiet. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was silent during the hearing, but made a statement afterward. `` I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` The judge asked for no conversations about this case, but I'd like to say that <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and I are thrilled to be back on TV.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> began broadcasting `` The Jim and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Show'' from their leased home near <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> earlier this month. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did n't appear on the telecast Tuesday and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, handled the program alone <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> quit the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in March 1987 after admitting a sexual encounter with former secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and paying her money to keep quiet. The ministry he founded wound up seeking reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months later. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> tried to raise money to buy back the ministry, but failed. Last month a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets, including a Christian theme park, at a bankruptcy auction. The fate of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s religious operation is unclear. In seeking the gag order, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> with a copy of a recent newspaper article in which retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> a `` sawed-off little runt.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> if any of the comments made by <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> focused on whether he felt <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was guilty or innocent of the charges contained in the indictment. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> responded affirmatively, saying <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> described his client as `` a thief.'' `` We ca n't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated with pre-trial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon. He's already gone overboard.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' statements could have affect potential jurors. `` This judge needs to be restrained,'' he said. `` He simply can not control himself. Just think of the dangers that this kind of pre-trial publicity could cause.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor handling the case, said the government was willing to agree to a consent order. `` The government is very concerned about the pre-trial publicity,'' she said, adding that prosecutors also were considering filing a motion for a gag order. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said prosecutors were concerned that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' request might be part of a strategy to get the case moved. Outside the courthouse, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> declined to say whether he planned to ask that the jury trial be moved out of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's February term but set no specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days to file other motions, such as a request for a continuance. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and three of his former top aides at the nearby <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> television ministry in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, were indicted Dec. 5 after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s operation under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership. The three have pleaded innocent to charges.

 Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> deftly sidestepped most direct questions Tuesday at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing, including queries about when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would resume nuclear arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But in his answers to questions from members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made it clear that the administration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will largely adhere to paths laid down by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and will move cautiously when it does depart from those policies. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ all trouble spots the new administration will be forced to grapple with in its early months in office _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> disclosed no specific plans for dramatic change, saying only that policies are under review and that in some instances the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team will be open to new approaches. As the scheduled two-day hearing opened, committee chairman Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to press for quick resumption of strategic arms control talks with the Soviets. `` There is no more urgent priority facing you than to continue the momentum in arms control with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, most particularly in the area of strategic nuclear weapons,'' Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee, said as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing opened The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have been recessed since November, and the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reviewing U.S.-Soviet relations, including arms-control negotiating postures. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> and other lawmakers urged that the START talks be resumed quickly and without linkage to other negotiations, such as upcoming multilateral talks on reductions in conventional forces. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was noncommittal, saying he could not specify a date by which the talks will resume. `` We must take a hard look at our negotiating position,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also will want to review the nation's needs for strategic modernization. But he noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has `` made it very clear he wants to build on the progress made to date,'' and added, `` It is my thought that we should move forward with START talks without necessarily linking them to anything else.'' Opening the hearing, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> read a statement calling for a new relationship between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration on foreign policy, and promised more extensive consultation with <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> than was evidenced during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two terms. He asked that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reciprocate. `` Yes, this is an appeal for a kinder, gentler <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, borrowing from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign-trail promise of a `` kinder, gentler nation.'' He said if partisanship and division on some thorny issues continue, stalemate will be inevitable. `` When we held the line together, on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, or throughout the INF negotiations, we succeeded. When we did not _ in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ the outcome was unsatisfactory to everyone,'' he said. He also called for renewed efforts to reach peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a strong international effort to rid the world of the threat of chemical weapons and new efforts to address global environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was White House chief of staff during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term and treasury secretary in the second, has little direct experience in foreign policy making. But his skill in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in negotiations are widely respected, and confirmation seemed virtually certain. On U.S.-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he remains wary of apparent moves by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to restructure and open Soviet society. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remains a heavily armed superpower,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` The talk is different, but the force structure and policies that support far-reaching interests and clients have not changed commensurately.'' Questioned about continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in regional conflicts around the world, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reiterated the new administration's intention to continue <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until `` national reconciliation'' is achieved and said the new administration `` can not and must not'' abandon the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> But in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he added: `` Clearly, we need a different approach,'' perhaps including an economic development plan assisted by European and Japanese allies. The standard for whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will militarily support rebel movements _ a policy that has come to be called `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> doctrine'' _ will be whether the group is a broad-based liberation group, national in scope, `` that expresses the will of the people,'' he said. During questioning on a wide range of issues, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said: _ That the new administration will undertake `` a full-scale review'' of the issue of Third World debt. `` I believe there is room for more creative financing mechanisms that can result in a reduction in the stock of debt,'' he said, suggesting that fundamental changes in the economies of debtor nations may be needed as much as debt relief. _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempts to pressure <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to abandon its apartheid policy of official racism through economic sanctions have not had the desired results. `` We need to review our policy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a unified plan, he said. `` We ought to consider perhaps some creative ways to build black institutions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' _ A decision on a U.S.-approved Panamanian administrator for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, due in 1990, will have to await developments there. `` I'm not sure it's in the best interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to see us move forward down there under the current situation,'' in which strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continues to hold power in defiance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust him. `` It is difficult to make progress on normalizing relations as long as Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in charge.'' _ The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will recognize whatever government takes power in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after the March elections, provided the elections are `` free and fair and in the best democratic tradition.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will stand strongly against any resumption of death-squad activity and might issue a new warning to the Salvadoran government that such a resurgence might lead to cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid.

<HEAD>US, Soviets Try to Settle on Old Russian Bonds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have begun trying to settle the 70-year-old question of much <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> should pay for bonds issued by <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>'s last czarist government. Until now, the Soviet governments of <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and his successors have refused to pay anything for the bonds, which had a value of $ 193 million when they were issued before 1919. Since then, unpaid interest has increased the total value of the bonds to $ 862 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The bonds were issued by the czarist government, but the last czar, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, was overthrown and shot in the 1917 revolution. <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s government repudiated them two years later. Since then, the bonds were considered to have little or no value, and were often valued more for the beauty of their engraving than any hope they would be repaid. <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, owns bonds with a face value of $ 20 million. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Claster </PERSON>, its chief operating officer, says there is no market for them. `` You make a market,'' he told an interviewer. `` How much will you give me? Five cents on $ 100?'' Negotiations began in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Nov. 28 and the two sides agreed to hold another meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Nyoka </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, public affairs office for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> and Canadian Affairs, said she did not know when or where it will take place. The Soviets have already made deals with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on czarist bonds held by citizens of those nations. Making a deal with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might make it easier to float new Soviet bonds here, though Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said there would be several legal obstacles. One of those hurdles may be another $ 674 million the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> still carries on its books from World War II, which is part of the $ 9 billion cost of food and equipment sent to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the `` lend-lease'' plan of World War II. In addition, the Soviets also owe $ 109 million to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, although the Soviets are keeping current on those payments. Many European banks have opened new lines of credit for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and some American banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, are interested in doing more business. These deals, which according to some estimates now reach $ 7 billion, evoked criticism from former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who called them a potential aid to the Soviet military. `` These may be all going into production of better fertilizer,'' he said in a speech to business executives last month. `` The same chemicals, however, are used for chemical warfare in many cases.'' But <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON>, press relations officer for the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, said a distinction should be made between short-term loans for trade deals and longer-term lines of credit such as those being offered by banks in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said his bank is interested only in short-term deals. `` These are n't for missiles that are going to be used to bomb <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. First <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has agreed with a Soviet bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naordny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, to finance projects in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other east European countries. <PERSON> Zehnder </PERSON> says it plans to introduce the Soviet bank to its clients who want to do business in the East.

<HEAD>Researchers Irked By Growing Community Resistance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medical research scientists are voicing growing concern that their work on behalf of humanity is being threatened by community activists unduly preoccupied with the effect on the people down the street. The `` not in my backyard'' syndrome was debated Tuesday during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. `` In the cases I examined, the community wants to have some accountability if there are any health and safety implications to the research,'' said <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON>, an associate professor of urban and environmental policy at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Community opposition to research facilities has blossomed with increasing public concern over toxics, land use and other issues, and with passage of tougher environmental laws, he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> disagreed at a news conference on the `` not in my backyard'' syndrome. <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said such controversies have become common largely `` because of the journalistic coverage of them. It will get a lot of sympathy.'' During a Saturday night keynote address to the convention, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said scientists' ability to solve society's problems is suffering as some environmental and no-growth groups become `` enemies of scientific progress. `` We need a lot more stiffness in the face of special political interests that are hostile to American science,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, calling <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` the nation's capital of activist, single-issue and ` not-in-my-backyard' politics.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> associate vice president <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> denounced what he called `` cynical manipulation'' of environmental laws by animal rights activitists and others opposed to research for non-environmental reasons. The extent of mutual hostility on the issue became apparent during the news conference Tuesday. Hotel security police escorted community activist <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Verges </PERSON> from the session after she claimed to be a reporter and launched into a brief speech against the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to establish labs in a building it owns in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> neighborhood. She later accused scientists of being `` arrogant, hostile, mean-spirited and unwilling to bargain.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said homeowners oppose the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> research facility because it's an industrial use in a residential neighborhood and because they fear it will harbor toxic, radioactive, infectious and cancer-causing substances. The university disputes the allegations. `` The university has tried to push us in the press as ... local dissidents opposed to science. That's a lot of bull,'' <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. He called biomedical research necessary, but added, `` One can not destroy the quality of life that the research is intended to preserve.'' Yet zoning laws often fail to address whether small research labs should be allowed in residential zones, <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON> said. He said cases of communities seeking to exert control over research included studies of germ warfare agents, nuclear weapons research, semiconductors and genetically engineered microbes that would be released to the environment. But <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> indicated environmental concerns sometimes are ridiculous. There was a `` hysterical'' reaction against pollutants from the proposed building where <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> wanted to house research rodents, even though `` the most serious substance to be used was a cleaner called Zonk to clean the cages,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Krimsky </PERSON> said scientific chaos could result if national standards for experiments on animals and humans were superseded by local standards. `` Researchers would move to the community where they would have the easiest set of guidelines,'' he said. And the ultimate result, <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said, might be to drive laboratories to poor areas without activist neighborhood groups.

<HEAD>Official Newspaper Says Leadership Can't Control Country</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A deeply divided communist leadership is unable to control the country's economic and political crisis, and further social upheaval is imminent, a state-run newspaper said Tuesday. `` The following is clear: this country is not being run by anyone,'' the leading official daily <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. `` More precisely, it is being run by divided, dangerously antagonistic <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> leaderships with different ideological concepts, creating chaos in politics and economy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> said. Meanwhile, the ruling 23-member Politburo announced that on Jan. 25 the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will `` discuss the political situation in the country, relations within the party and the functioning and responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its Politburo.'' The wording of the announcement, carried by the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency, indicated the session might result in leadership changes. In an apparent attempt to bridge the growing rifts between <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s republics, the nine-member state presidency on Tuesday appealed to opposing leaderships `` to settle their differences by dialogue.'' Public discontent after years of rising inflation and falling living standards, <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> said, `` is turning into a full-scale revolt,'' threatening the very foundations of the communist system. `` The crisis is so deep that it can, at any moment, cause even greater social upheavals, which would force the country into a completely unwanted direction,'' the paper said. The most liberal republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> favor political pluralism and more democracy as a solution to the country's woes, but southern regions led by the country's largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> advocate more central control and a greater role for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The choice of a new premier later this week may cause yet another sharp clash between the country's liberal and conservative regions. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said the worsening crisis calls for an emergency party congress meeting to resolve conflicts and elect a completly new leadership. `` It is better to have an extraordinary congress than to be forced to introduce extraordinary measures,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. The country's six republics and two provinces have wide autonomy in political and economic affairs, creating eight virtually self-ruling states that must reach consensus when passing important new laws. That often leads to watered-down compromises. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is faced with confusion sometimes bordering on `` political chaos,'' <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> said. Unable to control the economic crisis, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> resigned last month, leaving the country virtually ungoverned, the <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> daily said. In addition, under pressure from hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> leaders, the party elites in the provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and in the republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> have been ousted and only interim leaderships have been left in charge of the regions. The ouster of the entire <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> ruling elite came after more than 120,000 people demonstrated last week in <LOCATION> Titograd </LOCATION>, the region's capital, demanding the leadership step down because of the disastrous state of the republic's economy The action was applauded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s state-controlled media. But the mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> were denounced in the liberal northern republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and described as being covertly `` orchestrated'' by followers of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is alleged to have federal leadership ambitions.

<HEAD>Mayors Say Homelessness Increasing, Especially Among Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Urban homelessness and hunger increased significantly in 1988, particularly among families with children, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in reporting results of a survey of 27 major cities. One of every four homeless persons in the surveyed cities was a child. `` Families _ women and children _ they make up the most significant increase we have experienced,'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said in releasing the findings. The conference, which conducts an annual survey of hunger and homelessness, reported that both had risen in nearly all of the cities it surveyed. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., speaking to the mayors later, called the survey `` a devastating indictment of the neglect of the needs of our major urban centers. He said the mayors had made a compelling case for increased spending on the problems. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the rate of increase seemed to have slowed a bit from the previous year, in part because of increased emergency services provided by state and local governments. Officials in every city surveyed cited a lack of affordable housing as the main cause of homelessness, and <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> blamed a sharp decline in federal spending on low-income housing during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admininistration. `` Shelters are not the answer,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Permanent, affordable housing _ that is the answer.'' The survey was released at the opening of the annual winter meeting of the organization of big-city mayors. The survey was conducted among the 27 cities whose mayors sit on the conference's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger and Homelessness, headed by <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> Among its findings were that in the past year in the surveyed cities: _ Requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent. All but two of the cities registered an increase. _ Requests for emergency food were up an average 19 percent. Three-fifths of those asking for emergency food were memebers of families. _ An average of 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter went unmet; and among homeless families the figure was 23 percent. Shelters in two out of three cities reported they turned away homeless families because of a lack of resources. _ In 62 percent of the cities, emergency food assistance facilities had to turn away people, also for lack of resources. _ On average the composition of the homeless population was 49 percent single men, 34 percent members of families, 13 percent single women and the rest unaccompanied youth. One in four was a child. An average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and one-fourth were severely mentally ill; 23 percent had full-time or part-time jobs; 26 percent were veterans. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> called for more federal spending on urban problems, and said he was encouraged by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stated commitment to making homelessness a high priority. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> mayor said that by holding the increase in the defense budget to the inflation rate in the coming fiscal year, an extra $ 4 billion could be made avilable for low-income housing and emergency shelter programs. That would not solve the problem, he said, but could at least pay for emergency shelter programs and get started on increasing the availability of affordable housing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for secretary of housing and urban development, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, is to meet with the mayors Wednesday. The survey was conducted among officials from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, P.R.; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has approved 10 pardons in recent days, but has not yet decided whether to grant such relief to newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, an administration source said Tuesday. The source, discussing the subject on the grounds of anonymity, said `` there are no big names'' among those for whom <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had approved pardons. But the source would not identify the recipients. `` There may be as many as a couple of dozen that are before the president,'' the official said, adding that consideration of pardons for <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> and Hammer is `` well along in the process.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, questioned earlier in the day about the status of the <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> case, said only that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was considering several pardon requests. `` It's certainly possible that a decision could be made before he leaves,'' he said when asked whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would grant pardons before he leaves office Friday. Although <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> would not identify who had applied for pardons, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself told reporters Sunday that he had asked staff aides `` to look into the question'' of a possible pardon for newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bank. She now is married and living in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> under the married name of <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. There's also a longstanding pardon request by industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, the head of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who was fined $ 3,000 and placed on a year's probation in connection with his guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in connection with the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that several pardon requests, with recommendations for action, had been sent to the White House by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in recent months. He would n't say how many are pending at the White House. `` I wo n't comment on any individuals that are in this category,'' the spokesman said. `` Some of them are recent. Some of them, we've had for weeks or for months. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had been told that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` does n't have any of these on his desk'' at this time. The administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the pardon approvals `` tend to trickle over. ... We got 10 back from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, approved, last week.'' Under routine procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pardons office would contact the person getting a pardon or that person's attorney, he said. Returning from the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he was going to grant a last-minute pardon to <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` All of this thing, I have asked everybody to look into this for me,'' he replied. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery. She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group of self-styled revolutionaries who abducted her in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank heist. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was convicted of charges connected with the robbery and sentenced to seven years in prison. Her sentence was commuted by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s predecessor, President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and she was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months. In an interview Monday with The Advocate of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> at her <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, home, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was asked whether she thought <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expression of interest in her case might result in a pardon `` I do n't know,'' she replied. `` It's a little premature for anything like that. If he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- does n't approve it, it would go to the next administration.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, now 34, lives in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION> with her husband and two daughters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has steadfastly insisted that he is not considering a pardon for former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who is scheduled to go on trial late this month on a variety of charges related to the Iran-Contra affair.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been buying older Soviet-designed jet fighters and other <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> weapons on the open market for the past year to test their effectiveness and to train American servicemen, a military spokeswoman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said the purchases began in early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international arms dealers or private citizens Soviet MiG-15, 17 and 21 jet fighters. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has bought Soviet air-defense equipment such as radar systems with a view toward better training <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pilots, she added. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has long conducted tests and experiments with military equipment made in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and Third World countries and later captured, stolen or covertly purchased. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had not acknowledged previously, however, that efforts are now made to buy Soviet weaponry in an open manner in the world's arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret. Last September, the Pentagon announced the creation of a new organization known as the Mobile Operational Test Force, set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Operational Test and <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, that receives the Soviet equipment being purchased. Reporters were later allowed to watch the new organization test some Soviet-bloc equipment at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, N.M. Reporters were not told then, however, that much of the equipment they were viewing _ including the MiG jet fighters _ had been purchased through arms dealers and other `` non-covert'' sources. That acknowledgement came Tuesday only when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> responded to a report by the trade publication `` Inside the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>,'' focusing on one aspect of the testing program. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is purchasing Soviet and other ` threat' aircraft from commercial sources,'' said <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON> `` It is a continuing effort.'' The spokeswoman acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> does not expect to find the newest and most modern Soviet weapons for sale on the open market. But she said that `` purchasing Soviet aircraft from commercial sources is often three to four times cheaper than modifying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft to Soviet characteristics.'' `` In addition, openly acquired aircraft and equipment can be tested openly by average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen, which adds to operational testing realism,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> gave unqualified support Tuesday to the controversial 50 percent pay raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and the Cabinet, acknowledging however, `` I know it's a lot.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his comments in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll showed that eight out of 10 Americans oppose raising the salaries of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who served four years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to take a somewhat different stand than his new boss, President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On Jan. 6, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he supported President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement of the 50 percent pay raise but added he may take another look at the issue after becoming president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked if the nation could afford such a big pay increase at a time of huge deficits, said, `` Well, I do n't know whether we can afford anything than to get this deficit under control.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not qualify his endorsement. `` I support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to send that up to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. I know it's a lot but I think he thought long and hard. I support his decision.'' The pay raise plan will take effect next month unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vetoes or modifies it. Under the proposal that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsed, the president's salary would rise from $ 200,000 to $ 350,000 and the vice president's would go up from $ 115,000 to $ 175,000. However, the Constitution prevents <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from getting an increase for the term to which he was elected, and presumably <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be covered by the same prohibition. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be sworn in with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in ceremonies Friday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he will model his job after the way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> performed it, refusing to discuss publicly what they talk about in private. He said he would not speak up in Cabinet meetings or when other people are present, giving his views to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> alone. `` He's going to rely on me for advice on things that he thinks are important,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said everyone he's talked to who has been vice president _ including <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ said, `` do n't get bogged down with trivia. Do n't get tied down with line-item assignments early on There's always going to be someone who says, ` Well, this issue has come up, what shall we do with it?' Someone will suggest, ` Well, let's give it to the vice president.''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the assignments he takes on `` will be of substance, stature and of importance to the president, and those assignments will be forthcoming.'' He said one thing he wants to do is to try to change the stereotype image of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as insensitive to the plight of the poor and minorities. He said he would travel to inner city neighborhoods, `` to hear them out, to get a feel, a sensitivity'' about their problems. Acknowleding that the budget deficit will prevent new spending programs, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` money's not everything.'' He said he would use the tools of leadership and persuasion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials say the key foreign policy issue facing the new president will be devising a strategy for dealing with a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is rapidly changing under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` My personal viewpoint is that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is in a much stronger position than -LRB- seen by -RRB- the conventional wisdom in this country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I think there are a lot of skeptics in this country about him. I think he's in a very strong position. `` He's consolidated power much quicker than any other Soviet general secretary. He's way ahead of -LRB- the late Leonid -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. He -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- consolidated power in three years which took <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> 10 years to do.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he had not met <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but considers him `` a very effective, capable leader -LRB- who -RRB- has an opportunity to do something.'' Talking about <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s twin programs of `` glasnost,'' or openness, and `` perestroika,'' or economic reform, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I think glasnost is for real. I happen to think that the Soviet society today is more open than it has been in the past, that you read publications today that you would not have read five years ago, three years ago, 10 years ago. ... `` Perestroika on the other hand I'm personally a bit more skeptical of. I think perestroika _ anytime someone tries to reform the system, particularly that system, is just a consolidation of power. I think <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s been very effective in the consolidation of power.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected an Israeli suggestion for Palestinian elections in the occupied territories and said a vote could be held only after the Israelis leave. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> denied he threatened a Palestinian mayor on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> who proposed a truce in the Palestinian uprising. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating in a probe to track down the bomber of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. Speaking at a news conference at the end of a two-day visit to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> rejected the notion of elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> had `` very, very bad experiences of elections run by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` The only elections which are acceptable are under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> after the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. The last voting in the territories was in municipal elections in 1976, when candidates supporting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> were swept into office. Many of the elected mayors later were deposed. Two were targets of a Jewish underground and were maimed in bomb attacks. `` One lesson is enough,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. The Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> proposed an election to chose an alternative leadership that could negotiate for the Palestinians, but the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> under Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has been cool to the idea. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization, and it has dismissed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s declaration last month renouncing terrorism and accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist as a public relations ploy. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> denied he threatened <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, who suggested a truce in the 13-month uprising on condition that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> release <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, one of the few elected in 1976 still in office, withdrew the proposal after a broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as saying: `` Any <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader who proposes an end to the intifadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and endangers his life. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will know how to deal with him.'' Asked about the broadcast by a reporter at a reception after the news conference, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said the radio `` misquoted me. I said if I tried to stop the intifadeh the small boy who is standing beside me would shoot me.'' The uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, has left at least 362 Palestinians and 15 Israelis dead. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating to find who sabotaged Pan American Flight 103, which blew up over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, killing 270 people. `` We are doing our best ... because this is an awful crime,'' he said, declining to elaborate. He said 94 countries have officially recognized the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> which the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, declared Nov. 15 He said he expected that number to rise to 120 within a few weeks. On his second day in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and leaders of the political parties. He held talks Monday with President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Harri </PERSON> <PERSON> Holkeri </PERSON>, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kalevi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorsa </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Sununu Says Bush May Favor Defense Increase</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Incoming presidential Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> suggested Tuesday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors an increase in military spending near the 2 percent-plus-inflation level proposed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The remarks, made by <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in a broadcast interview, appeared to be at odds with earlier hints by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advisers pointing towards cuts in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense budget to make room for more spending for some social programs. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, in an interview on `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s One on One,'' was asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, wants a defense spending increase of 2 percent above inflation in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. `` I think somewhere around that range,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> responded. The interview for the syndicated television program was taped on Tuesday to be aired on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, through his campaign and in statements after the election, voiced a desire to expand spending for some social programs, including education, the Head Start program, child care and environmental cleanup. In the past, neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor any of his top aides have indicated where, in relation to the final <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget submitted last week, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would stand on defense spending. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will propose his own overall budget modifications to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several weeks after his inauguration Friday morning. `` I think the question before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> right now, and the -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- administration is looking at in the budget they're going to present, is what level of growth from the budget ought to be maintained -LRB- for defense -RRB- and how that growth is related to inflation,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his final budget, proposed defense spending authority of $ 315.2 billion for fiscal 1990, up from $ 298.8 billion in the current fiscal year. That's an overall increase of 5.5 percent and takes into account about a 3.5 percent increase in the inflation indicator used for defense calculations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a `` flexible freeze'' in overall spending, which would hold the total growth in spending to the rate of inflation, with Social Security benefits being exempt. Thus, every increase above inflation would have to be offset by corresponding cuts in other programs. Going along with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposal for an increase in spending of 2 percent over inflation would make it even harder for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to carry out his proposal for a `` flexible freeze'' without new taxes, while getting the federal deficit to below the $ 100 billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said growth in revenues to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> in the coming year would help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meet his goals. Still, he conceded, `` we're going to have a very spirited and lively set of budget discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, spent the day in a series of staff meetings and news interviews and also spent some time working on his inaugural address, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. She said he is now working on a second draft of the speech shorter than the draft he had earlier in the week. `` He said he wanted it under fifteen minutes,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said.

 Angry Israeli soldiers told Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Tuesday that they were being robbed of their civilized values because they were forced to mistreat Palestinians. Their statements reflected growing concern in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that the 13-month occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is having a brutalizing effect on the morals of Israeli troops. One after another, eight reservists rose to confront <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as he toured <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and visited an army tent camp outside the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, which has 120,000 Arab residents The soldiers, in their late 20s and early 30s, said they had beaten innocent people to instill fear in them and enforce order. Several said they were ashamed of their actions and had difficulty facing friends and loved ones when they returned home. `` The basic values we grew up on changed whether we like it or not during our service here. Every day children are being hurt,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmelli </PERSON>. `` The chief of staff -LRB- Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> -RRB- said it would take time. But the time is long and the price is high.'' Three Palestinians died in the occupied lands Tuesday, raising to 362 the number of Arabs killed in the revolt. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he would take the soldiers' comments into consideration, but that protesters who threw rocks and bottles want to end <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence as a state. `` We hate those <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> people because they make us kill <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> children. We do n't want it,'' he said. `` They force us to bear arms, but we must do that to survive. Sometimes you have to fight for your human values. You have to have You do any important job,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, a hawk who has advocated tough measures for putting down the revolt. Shortly before he arrived at the encampment, gunfire could be heard in the city, which has become a major battlegroud for Palestinian youths and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The soldiers patrol the narrow winding streets of the <LOCATION> Casbah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' marketplace. `` In order to enforce order in the marketplace, we must be brutally violent to innocent people,'' said a reservist who identified himself only as <PERSON> Yotam </PERSON>, a laborer from <PERSON> Tiberius </PERSON>. `` When I get up in the morning, I say to myself, ` Now I have to go out and chase somebody' ... and when I catch him I look at his hands and see he is a working man, just like me. `` I have to slap him or beat him -LRB- with -RRB- murderous blows to get him to fear me. It wears me down as a person. It breaks me. These are not the values I grew up on.'' After eight of 50 soldiers spoke, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> thanked them for being frank and called for patience. `` The very fact that you carry out your mission, and then can talk about your concerns ... shows that your values are not eroding,'' he said. When <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told reporters he did not believe the comments reflected the opinions of all troops, a reservist interrupted and shouted: `` Yes they do.'' Another soldier approached reporters later and said those who spoke out did not represent the entire unit. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, who escorted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to the tent camp, appeared embarrassed by the attacks on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and excused himself in the middle of the meeting. Before leaving, <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> told the soldiers: `` The army's mission is to enable the politicians to -LRB- solve the problem -RRB- from a position of strength. ... It is your job as military men to fulfil the mission, regardless of your individual views and concepts.''

<TEXT>
 A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lawyer on Tuesday defended the government's attempt to label some political documentary films `` propaganda'' when approving their tax-free export, saying the label is informative, not disparaging. But a lawyer for independent filmmakers told a federal appeals court that the labeling was `` an informal system of censorship.'' The argument before the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> involved the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s latest attempt to review thousands of documentaries each year for their content before approving them as `` educational, scientific or cultural,'' which allows their tax-free export under a treaty signed by 72 nations. The agency's first regulations, which rejected films that advocated viewpoints or were deemed to misrepresent a government's policy, were declared unconstitutional by the 9th Circuit last year The current regulations would require a film to be primarily factual in its approach, to be based on a `` reasonably current state'' of available information, and to acknowledge the existence of opposing viewpoints. They would also allow the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> to tell other countries that a film, though approved as educational, was `` propaganda'' in that it was designed to promote a political, religious or economic viewpoint. The foreign government could then decide whether to approve tax-free imports. The regulations were challenged by the makers of six documentary films. Four, on subjects that include the dangers of uranium mining, disarmanent and Agent Orange, were denied <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> approval; one, on drug use among urban youth, had been rejected under the earlier standards but was approved under the new standards; the sixth, a sympathetic portrayal of the 1979 Nicaraguan revolution, was approved but given a `` propaganda'' label. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rejected the new standards last May and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> to draft a third, content-neutral set of standards while giving provisional approval to the films. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keats </PERSON> asked a three-judge panel Tuesday to reverse <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON>'s ruling. The 1954 treaty, known as the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Agreement, requires governments to evaluate films based on their contents, Ms. <PERSON> Keats </PERSON> said. She said the Constitution does not prohibit a viewpoint-neutral assessment of whether a film is presented in a factual manner, or a non-coercive statement that it is propaganda. `` On its face, the propaganda label does not either disparage a film or prevent it from being circulated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Keats </PERSON> said. She said the label merely encourages foreign governments to take a second look at a film. Claims of censorship are `` unduly patronizing -LRB- to -RRB- foreign governments,'' she said. But the filmmakers' lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the label was not simply neutral information, but an attempt to get foreign governments to deny tax-free import of films that should qualify under the treaty. He said <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has already declared that it would not accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films with `` propaganda'' labels. `` The <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> has said ... they do n't want these films to have benefits,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> told the court. He called the labeling `` an informal system of censorship.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` propaganda'' labels on some imported films were allowed in 1986 by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which observed that the labels did not prevent anyone from seeing the films. But <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the current case is different because the labels are intended to stop foreign circulation of the films.

 Two Arab American officials have been invited to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the possibility of granting a visa for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an Arab-American group said Tuesday. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Abdeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabara </PERSON>, and the chairman of its board, former senator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abourezk </PERSON>, were asked to meet next Monday with an aide to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, said the group's spokesman, <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON>. The aide, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, deals in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> affairs. `` The stated purpose of the invitation was to discuss an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> visa,'' <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed that such a meeting had been set to discuss the results of <PERSON> Abourezk </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last week, but declined to discuss the question of a visa for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last Friday accepted an invitation from <PERSON> Abourezk </PERSON> to address the <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION>'s annual convention on April 13 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ADC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Abourezk </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as well as with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee. He also met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, who has been conducting a newly launched dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday they had not received any applicationfrom <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for a visa. If it comes, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, `` we will consider it very carefully. We wo n't say in advance what we'll do.'' Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rejected a visa request from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last November, citing concerns about the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in terrorism. But subsequently, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> when it recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced the use of terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only once _ in 1974 to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. His visa at the time was limited to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s prestigious <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> last year extended an invitation to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to address the forum, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said it could not obtain a visa for him to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, an early developer of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> whose son was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate last year, was killed in a traffic accident Tuesday. He was 95. The father of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> died in a two-vehicle collision after apparently failing to yield the right of way at a rural intersection between <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION> and Mission near the Mexican border, said Police Chief <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>. The senior <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> remained active in his farming, ranching and real estate interests until his death. `` He was here two or three times a week, sometimes every day,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, foreman for the past 25 years at <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s 16,000-acre La Coma Ranch in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of six ranches <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> owned `` He was one of the biggest developers down here, cleared thousands of acres.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was on the podium during much of last summer's Democratic National Convention, where his son was named the party's vice presidential candidate. The senator's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office said he left immediately for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after learning of his father's death. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON> said he would ask Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> to order flags flown at half-staff the day of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s funeral <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was `` a great <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> entrepreneur who contributed much to the people of our state, particularly those in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Gib </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said: `` I hope that when I obtain that age that he obtained, that I'll have the same outlook, the same health and the spirit that he had. He was a great Texan.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was pronounced dead at the accident scene by Justice of the Peace <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosel </PERSON> of Mission. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> apparently failed to yield the right of way at a stop sign to an eastbound car on Highway 107 on Tuesday morning. Two people injured in the second car were <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosalez </PERSON>, 22, and his sister <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>, 19. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosalez </PERSON> was released after treatment for cuts and bruises at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Rosalez </PERSON> was admitted in stable condition and was undergoing surgery Tuesday, the hospital spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and six ranches scattered over a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> empire he started carving out of the brush and thorns in 1920. In his final years, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued living at a residence on <LOCATION> Bentsen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> near Mission, and was up at dawn every day and on the road to his real estate office or one of the farms and ranches in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> counties. He and his wife, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>, who died in 1977, had four children: <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> architect; <PERSON> Don </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> businessman; and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, the wife of Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>. The senior <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, one of six children of Danish parents, grew up thrashing wheat and busting wild horses in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Badlands </LOCATION>. He had little schooling, leaving his studies at 13 to follow the grain harvests. He and his early partners bought and tamed wild mustangs trapped in the canyons of the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, paying $ 3 a head and selling them for $ 12. By the 1970s his holdings ranged from farm, cattle, oil, gas and nursery operations to control of six banks, stock in other banks and land sales entimated at $ 1 million a month. Although he had sold his bank holdings, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued farming, running 5,000 head of cattle, operating a nursery, taking in oil and gas revenues and managing a real estate business.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> labored Tuesday to trim his first speech as president into more sermonette than sermon, as the capital and an estimated 300,000 celebrants made ready for an inauguration extravaganza that wo n't leave much else to moderation. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, accorded a warm reception to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s closest confidant and senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appointee, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who at confirmation hearings pleaded for a partnership between the executive and legislative branches in the conduct of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign policy <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, sure to win approval as secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, said the first order of business should be `` a meeting of our minds on how to proceed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The task, he said, `` is to arrange affairs so that whatever the outcome of perestroika, a more responsible, constructive foreign policy will remain in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s interest. The new Soviet leadership also was on the mind of Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview Tuesday that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` is in a much stronger position'' than many American skeptics believe. `` He's consolidated power much quicker than any other Soviet general secretary,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said also that one of the things he wants most to do in his new role is work to change the image of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as insensitive to the plight of minorities and the poor. He said he intends to travel to inner-city neighborhoods and `` hear them out, to get a feel, a sensitivity about their problems.'' Elsewhere in the capital, thousands of performers, from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> heart-throbs to high-school majorettes, rehearsed for scores of inaugural events. The first will be a twilight pageant and fireworks spectacular at the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday. The leading man remained in the cutting room, trying to reduce the length of the address he will deliver Friday at noon, upon taking office as president. He aimed at `` something in the range of 15 minutes or less,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. The speech was drafted by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON>, the principal author of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican convention acceptance speech last summer and a contributor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nationally broadcast farewell last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent her `` back to the drawing boards'' on Monday, and was working with her again Tuesday to tighten it, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could do worse than aim for brevity when he mounts the Capitol's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portico </LOCATION> Friday to take his oath beneath the winter skies. One president, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, droned on in an icy downpour for nearly two hours, caught pneumonia and died. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> delivered the briefest inaugural address, after taking the oath for his second term. It totaled 135 words. Wednesday's opening for the five-day inaugural whirlwind, an outdoor affair, is to be attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. It will feature a wingtip-to-wingtip flyover by 21 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> combat jets, in a salute to a new commander-in-chief who flew 58 combat missions over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in World War II. The show also will include music from the <ORGANIZATION> Gatlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and the Beach Boys and will culminate in a massive fireworks display lighting the sky with 1,000 electric-white bursts, in keeping with the `` thousand points of light'' theme of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. Later in the evening, matters turn far more pricey _ and exclusive _ for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faithful, with three black-tie dinners going at $ 1,500 per seat. But affairs of state also took their place. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was expected to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday for a second day of questioning about the new administration's foreign policy. Confirmation hearings were scheduled Thursday for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as labor secretary and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as budget director. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday that `` Bipartisanship does not mean that we must always agree'' on foreign policy. `` But eventually we must proceed, and when we do it is best that we do so together.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was cordially received, and got a strong introduction and endorsement from Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a fellow Texan and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for vice president last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other cabinet appointees `` are generally experienced, hopefully pragmatic people, and we wo n't have the rigid ideology of the first <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term.'' He added that `` I am trying very hard to establish from our side an atmosphere of cooperation and bipartisanship.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bustled as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s big day neared. Hotels were filled with fat-cat revelers, and workers scrambled to finish construction of inaugural exhibits, platforms and reviewing stands. The overall pricetag: an estimated $ 25 million, mostly raised from ticket prices and sales of souvenirs. But that does n't include the labor and other contributions from special-interest groups and ordinary volunteers eager to play a part in the festival marking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s changing of the guard. A display on the city's mall, for example, includes five-story-tall replicas of the Statue of Liberty and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s `` rising sun'' chair, each erected by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> lay organization. Street vendors hawked <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> sweatshirts for $ 12. A `` Republican integrity'' button, with pictures of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, went for $ 5. The official inaugural committee mailed catalogs to 1.5 million Republicans, offering items ranging from packets of chili spice, $ 2.50, to crystal statuettes for $ 1,200. A terrycloth bathrobe with the inaugural seal goes for $ 75. The biggest money-maker of all is the black-tie entertainment gala scheduled for Thursday night at the cavernous <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Convention Center, where TV and Broadway star <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> captured the Republican mood Tuesday with a sizzling practice rendition of her opening number: <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>'s `` This Joint Is Jumpin'.'' The show, to be televised live by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> at 8 p.m. EST Thursday, has a cast of 1,100 performers representing a cross-section of American entertainment, including ballet dancers <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, singers <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The sold-out gala is expected to gross $ 9 million, including $ 4.9 million in television money. Ticket revenues include $ 25,000 for each of 90 eight-seat boxes.

 Federal investigators are exploring whether <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> use illegal quotas to restrict the number of Asian-American students they admit, an official said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has been collecting and analyzing statistical information on admissions at the two schools since last fall, said department spokesman <PERSON> Mahlon </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. He declined to say what sparked the probe. No conclusions have been reached, he said. Both <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> deny using quotas for any ethnic groups, and both schools point to a significant rise in enrollment of Asian-American students. At <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, Asian-Americans make up 22.9 percent of the freshman class, up from 17.8 percent in 1980. At <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, the number of Asian-American freshmen roughly tripled over the past decade, from 4.8 percent in 1978 to 14.2 percent this year. By comparison, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is only about 2 percent Asian. However, <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say Asian-Americans tend to be high academic achievers and have been applying to top colleges and universities in rising numbers. `` The real issue is not whether the number of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> students is going up, but what percentage of qualified applicants is being accepted,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit educational group in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, for example, acknowledged last year that over the past decade it had admitted an average of 17 percent of all white applicants, but 13.3 percent of Asians applicants. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will review the data and send investigators to question officials on both campuses, probably before the end of the current school year. `` Statistics alone do n't always tell the story,'' he said. `` ... When you talk to admissions officers, you understand there may be non-discriminatory policies that are driving the data and creating certain patterns.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzsimmons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s director of admissions, said Asians tend to be slightly stronger than whites on academic criteria and slightly weaker on extracurricular activities, which can count against them because <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> seeks students with diverse talents, such as music, art and leadership. In addition, he said, relatively few Asians in the applicant pool are children of alumni or prospective varsity athletes. `` When all those factors are taken into account, the difference in admission rates for the two groups disappears,'' he said. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Lum </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> senior and co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on campus, said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> has had Asian students working in the admissions office to recruit Asian-Americans, especially from low-income families, for four years. `` It would be counterproductive to do that and impose quotas at the same time,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> stopped qualifying Asian-Americans for affirmative action when it became clear that they were overrepresented, not underrepresented, in proportion to population, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifka </PERSON>, an assistant vice chancellor responsible for admissions. <PERSON> Lifka </PERSON> said 35 percent of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> applicants were admitted in 1988, compared with 32 percent of whites. `` We are convinced that if the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> looks at the data carefully ... they will conclude that there is no discrimination.'' If the department determines a college or university discriminates on the basis of race or ethnicity, it can block federal grants and guaranteed student loans which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars for major schools. But <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the schools are first given an opportunity to change their disputed practices, and most do so.

 A train collided with a bus taking children home from school Tuesday and dragged it 50 yards. Police said 41 people were killed and 72 injured, and the death toll might rise. School books, shoes and pencils were strewn along the track and inside the demolished bus. `` Bodies were scattered all over. Children were screaming,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk who helped carry victims to ambulances and other rescue vehicles. Witnesses said the driver of the bus, which was carrying about 120 people, tried to cross the track ahead of the train but his engine stalled. Police said the driver escaped with minor injuries and five children riding on the steps jumped to safety. No one on the train was hurt. A woman said she saw the train approaching the unguarded crossing and believed the bus driver could not see it through a light drizzle, so she tried to flag him down but was ignored. Most of the dead and injured were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Balapitiya </LOCATION> village, about five miles from the accident. Twenty-five bodies were sprawled on the floor and tables of its three-room morgue. Three infants were among the dead. One lay on a morgue table beside a woman's body, but nurses did not know whether she was the mother. Other bodies, many badly mutilated, were on the floor awaiting identification. A wailing mother searched the hospital for a daughter who had been on the bus. `` Inoka! Inoka!'' she called out. Her two other children trailed along and nurses ran after her, trying to steer her away from the morgue. Most of those on the bus were children. It had picked up pupils from four schools at <LOCATION> Amblangoda </LOCATION> town and was was bound for <LOCATION> Urgasmanhandiya </LOCATION> village about 10 miles away when it came to the crossing at <LOCATION> Ahungalla </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ahungalla </LOCATION> is the halfway point of the bus route, which runs about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Altugama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>. Two brothers, <PERSON> Rohan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duminda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumara </PERSON>, were on one hospital bed, watched over by their father. The boys said they escaped with minor injuries to their legs because they were riding on the steps. <PERSON> Chandrika </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON>, a nurse, said the more seriously injured were taken to a larger hospital at <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>. Police officer K.M.M <PERSON> Keerthisinghe </PERSON> said at the hospital he did not have a breakdown of the casualties by age group, but at least 70 of the dead or injured were children.

 <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiano </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON> when she appeared in `` Deep Throat'' and other hard-core sex films, is supporting a local anti-pornography law facing a federal challenge. <PERSON> Marchiano </PERSON> has claimed in her book `` Ordeal'' that she suffered 2 -LCB- years of physical, sexual and mental abuse while being coerced into performing sex acts and appearing in sex films. The <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> law that Ms. <PERSON> Marchiano </PERSON> supports says pornography violates the civil rights of women when it portrays them as dehumanized sexual objects. It differs from many anti-pornography statutes in that it sets up civil remedies instead of criminal penalties. The law is being challenged by a local bookstore, three <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> residents and others who argue that it is vaguely written and would have an overly broad impact on work protected by the First Amendment. In a Jan. 6 affidavit, Ms. <PERSON> Marchiano </PERSON> said she wants to file a lawsuit in <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seeking damages and an injunction against any showing of her films there. `` Every time someone watches those films, they are watching me being raped,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marchiano </PERSON>'s affidavit said. `` Every time I am recognized from those films, I am violated again.''

 Leftist guerrillas Tuesday launched coordinated attacks on military positions in six northern towns, the armed forces and the rebels reported. The armed forces said three rebels were killed and three soldiers wounded in the battles before dawn in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. The guerrillas said they caused 25 casualties among army troops, but did not specify the number of dead and wounded. The rebels, who commented on the clandestine Radio <PERSON> Farbundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, did not mention their own losses. The radio, like the Marxist-led <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that has been battling the U.S.-backed government for nine years, is named for a 1930s revolutionary.

<TEXT>
 The sale of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> high-technology company to a West German chemical firm is being reviewed by a government task force in the first test of a new law that allows the president to block foreign purchases of American companies on national security grounds. The case involves the proposed sale of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> Electronic Materials of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Huels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The American company, an operating division of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> chemical company headquartered in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, produces silicon wafers, the flat discs used to make computer chips. Silicon wafers are the building blocks for the semiconductor industry, a sector of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy considered vital not only for national security reasons but also for trade reasons. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s edge in the battle with foreign competitors has centered in such high-technology fields as computer manufacturing. The proposed sale to the West German company was reviewed in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday by the Committee on Foreign Investment. The committee is composed of officials from eight government agencies and is headed by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, an assistant <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. The panel has until next Monday to forward a recommendation to the president. It is expected the proposed sale will be one of the first trade issues that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have to face. Originally, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> raised questions about the proposed sale. However, an attorney representing <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he believes the original objections had been dealt with. `` We have met with -LRB- government officials -RRB- on numerous occasions. We answered all of the questions and repeat questions,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauch </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Huels </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the giant West German conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Veba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, both met with officials from various agencies on Tuesday. `` There is no credible evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Huels </ORGANIZATION>, an exemplary company from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally, would so something that would injure the national security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON> said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said no announcement of the panel's recommendation would be released before it was reviewed by the president, who has 15 days under the law to reach a decision on the panel's findings. The review of foreign takeovers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies on national security grounds was included in the giant Omnibus Trade Act of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had become concerned that the wave of foreign purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies could be endangering national security. Three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers of silicon wafers have been sold to Japanese firms in the past four years and the sale of another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> silicon wafer supplier, the wafer division of <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milacron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Titanium </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is pending.

 In a small apartment about a mile from <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, two excited Solidarity activists tuned into the latest TV reports of a party meeting they believed would result in a decision to legalize the banned labor federation. Rarely have the long speeches at a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum commanded such close attention from Solidarity, which for seven years has tried the party's patience by refusing to abandon the fight for legal existence. `` Are they registering Solidarity yet?'' yelled <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region of Solidarity, to former underground Solidarity leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> had just flipped on the television switch in another room on the first day of the party debate on the future of Solidarity. He did not reply. The answer was not immediately forthcoming as party members heatedly debated for hours on Monday and Tuesday over a move to legalize Solidarity. The party had reason to be nervous. In 1980-81, during Solidarity's legal existence, an estimated 1 million party members joined the independent union movement. Thousands more turned in their party cards in disgust when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, imposed martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. But on Tuesday Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> urged the party to legalize the banned union on condition that it be `` a partner,'' not an opponent that would `` pull the country into anarchy.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> had vigorously defended the martial law decision in the early 1980s. The reversal in policy arises from the party's failure to eradicate Solidarity after the martial law crackdown and reflects the authorities' need to gain support from society to push through a program of radical economic reform. `` They -LRB- party leaders -RRB- are doing this because they realize they have to and it was obvious they had to,'' said <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, a veteran opposition activist who advised striking miners during <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years last August Although the shift in the party's attitude is welcome, some Solidarity activists believe the union must proceed with caution because the change results from necessity rather than good will. `` The authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on top. Let's wait and see what they have to say and read the fine print carefully,'' said <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity activists do not foresee a return to the heady days of 1980-81, when union work was a round-the-clock passion for many. But they acknowledge that a return of legal existence would change their lives. `` It would be a real tragedy for my family. I do n't have any children now and I wo n't have time for that with all my union activities,'' said <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, who first drew national attention when he became leader of Solidarity's <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region in 1980 at the age of 26. <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, who has long dreamed of visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, believes he may have to postpone any visit if Solidarity is legalized. For <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, regulation of the labor federation's status means he would be able to focus on solving other problems. <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> spent Tuesday afternoon taking part in a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in support of legalizing the Independent Students' Union and Solidarity While Solidarity is eager to resume its activities legally, that status poses challenges to union leaders such as how to organize the labor federation and how to achieve economic reform. But a return to legal existence would mean that many could finally emerge from the shadows of underground publishing and from church basement meetings into a more normal way of participating in public life.

 A passenger of a car pulled over for speeding on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turnpike </ORGANIZATION> was shot and killed Tuesday in a scuffle with a state trooper, authorities said. The driver of the car was arrested, and a second passenger was being sought by state and local police on foot and in helicopters, said state police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Trooper <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henig </PERSON>, 26, pulled over a luxury car with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> license plates about 12:30 p.m. because it was speeding, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Henig </PERSON> told one of the passengers to leave the car and asked for his identification. While the man searched his pockets, <PERSON> Henig </PERSON> spotted what he believed to be a small bag of marijuana inside, the spokesman said. The man then pushed <PERSON> Henig </PERSON> down and ran toward a marshy highway median, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Henig </PERSON> caught the man, subdued him and was putting his gun into his holster when the man kicked him, he said. `` There were a number of shots fired,'' said <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. `` When the weapon was turned toward the trooper, a shot was fired. He then turned the gun on the suspect and fired.'' Shortly afterwards, a car was stolen from a restaurant parking lot less than a half-mile away, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. Police were trying to determine whether the missing man stole the car, he said. Police tentatively identified the dead man as a 46-year-old <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> resident who was on parole for two bank robbery convictions in that state in 1976 and had moved to <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> in October, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. The driver was identified only as a 37-year-old <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, man. He was taken into custody, but no charges had been filed by late Tuesday. Police withheld the two men's names while verifying their identities, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. The trooper was not injured in the scuffle, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said Tuesday it will do all it can to stop West German firms from helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a poison gas plant and promised massive retaliation if <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> uses chemical weapons on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> planned to raise the issue during a visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> beginning Wednesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, acting as a police intermediary, appealed Tuesday for the surrender of a rapist who has attacked seven women in the subway. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was asked to make the public appeal after police received two calls to the 911 emergency line from a man who identified himself as the subway rapist. The man said he would surrender if a personal appeal from <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was televised. `` Please, please, not only stop what you are doing, but for your protection and for the protection of possible victims, please turn yourself in to the police authorities,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said as reporters and television cameras recorded his words at a hastily called news conference. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> promised the suspect would not be mistreated: `` You have my word, given me by them, that you will be treated properly and given complete justice in every respect.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the caller admitted he was a crack addict. `` He is apparently a very troubled person. He said he is sorry for what he did and he said he feels that he is getting a little bit out of control,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he was convinced the calls, which came in Monday at 12:45 p.m. and Tuesday at 10 a.m., were legitimate. Last February, a man claiming to be the bomber of an abortion clinic made a request for a TV appeal from <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. After <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s appeal, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Malvasi </PERSON> surrendered and pleaded guilty to dynamiting a clinic and planting a bomb that was defused before it exploded at another. He was sentenced to seven years in prison. `` Clearly there is hope that this may be a similar situation,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. The suspect now being sought by police is accused of raping or sodomizing four women and attempting to sexually assault three others over the past five months. In each case, the man forced a woman either off a train or a subway platform at gunpoint or knife-point and into the subway tunnel, where the attacks occurred.

 Western nations criticized the human rights records of some East European countries Tuesday, singling out harsh police actions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> called a `` glaring contradiction'' of international commitments. At a conference of foreign ministers, outgoing Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> coupled praise for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new openness under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> with criticism of some of its allies. He was more direct than most West European ministers, attacking <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> by name for police crackdowns on dissidents and persecution of minorities. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his colleagues gathered at the end of a 27-month conference to review the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreements on European security and cooperation, including human rights. The <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords were signed by 35 countries: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European nations except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Delegates had barely adopted their final document Sunday when Czechoslovak riot police crushed a rally in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. The police used water cannons and tear gas again Monday and Tuesday on dissidents honoring <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>. The 20-year-old student burned himself alive Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the Soviet-led invasion of the previous August that ended <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s brief `` Prague Spring'' liberalization. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Sunday, East German police arrested scores of human rights demonstrators. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> departed from his prepared text Tuesday to declare the police actions `` in glaring contradiction to the solemn international commitments'' just made in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> by those governments. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> told delegates to the review conference Sunday, before adoption of the final statement on human rights and security, it would not honor provisions on greater religious freedom and emigration. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not raise that issue specifically, but criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for increasing repression and shortages of food, heat and power endured by its 23 million citizens. `` In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> the economic and social conditions, as well as the political and civil rights of all citizens, are being eroded at a discouraging rate,'' he said, `` and in both <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, minorities have been particularly hard hit by government policies of recent years.'' He praised the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for a nine-year high in Jewish emigration and release of more than 600 prisoners of conscience, but noted that `` others continue to suffer repression or remain unjustly imprisoned for acting upon their human rights.'' `` We can not forget them,'' he said. Both the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and the West have praised the agreement, which provides for new negotiations on reducing conventional military forces, formation of groups to monitor compliance with human rights agreements, and for greater freedom of travel, emigration and information. Announcements that the Soviets will begin a unilateral withdrawal of 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in April strengthened hopes that the talks set for March in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> will lead to reducted conventional forces on the continent. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, however: `` We have a long way to go yet to achieve real peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' At a news conference, the secretary called the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION>, `` an inhumane structure'' symbolizing the repression of the Soviet bloc and said it should be torn down. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, in another tough speech focused on human rights, also called for destruction of the `` Cold War anachronism'' built by the Soviets and East Germans in 1961. `` It is the most public symbol of the divide between freedom on one side and its denial on the other,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall mocks all our work to remove barriers to contact and understanding.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> also spoke of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s agreement in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to attend a human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1991, which the Soviets have sought for some time. But in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> deplored the violent break-up of Czech demonstrations and threatened to boycott the conference unless the Soviets make sustained progress on human rights. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> many Britons `` were somewhat dismayed'' by television scenes showing peaceful demonstrations being `` forcibly broken up.'' `` I think it fully justifies the approach that we took on the human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, that we would not go unless certain strict criteria were met,'' she said. The Women's Campaign for Soviet Jewry, a British group opposed to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> conference, heckled ministers as they arrived for Tuesday's meeting. `` You sold out Soviet Jews too cheaply!'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON> shouted as <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would continue monitoring the Soviet human rights record and would attend the conference only if reform was translated into Soviet law and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is `` convinced that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> commitment to change is genuine and irreversible.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> spoke out against repression in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, as did <PERSON> Thorvald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and others. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was to arrive in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on Wednesday and speak Thursday.

 A citizens' watchdog group formed after <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s 1980 race riots Tuesday called for punishment of the white policeman whose fatal shooting of an unarmed black man touched off violence in the city's <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section. `` The people believe it's open season against blacks,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> to Lead the Struggle for Equality, or PULSE. The group called for a speedy investigation into the Monday night shooting, firing the police officer who did the shooting, first-degree murder charges against him, removal of the heavy concentration of police officers from <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, and formation of a countywide <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that it would investigate Monday night's shooting to determine whether there were civil rights violations, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bureau spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszynski </PERSON> said. He said the investigation would be completed `` as promptly as possible.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stephen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AME </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and a PULSE member, called the shooting `` nothing new. ... We knew it was going to erupt. It was only a matter of time. The same thing could happen tomorrow. The atmosphere is out there.'' PULSE, which has representatives from some 50 groups, most of them black community churches, has been alleging heavy-handed treatment by police against blacks for years. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendleton </PERSON>, the late <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said last year that he would look into their complaints, but the group never received any results, members said. PULSE listed 17 earlier incidents, six of them resulting in deaths, in which <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police allegedly used excessive violence against blacks, starting with the 1979 beating of black insurance executive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON>. The acquittal of the white Metro-Dade officers charged in <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON>'s death sparked <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s 1980 riots that claimed 18 lives. City and police officials have said PULSE has made unfair allegations. The group leaders, in a news conference joined by relatives of some of the listed victims, said this week's disturbances should show it's time for their advice to be taken `` They -LRB- police -RRB- have turned a deaf ear,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bethelem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's as if we're throwing words to the wind. Now we're going to reap the whirlwind.'' They said they wanted police to do their jobs, but to be sensitive to the community mood and not appear so heavy-handed. `` We have stood side-by-side with the police force. We would be the first ones to ask for law and order,'' <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Local fishermen threatened to confront a large French trawler on the high seas Tuesday in a bitter dispute over fishing rights around this French territory off <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Yvon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodeman </PERSON>, president of the fishermen's union, told reporters a trawler from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Miquelon </PERSON> was called into port to prepare for action against the factory freezer trawler Grand Hermine. The 6,000 people living on this rocky archipelago 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> rely almost entirely on fishing for their livelihood, with cod the main catch. A compromise last fall allowed one factory ship from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to fish in the zone, but the arrival of two touched off tensions once again. The fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish and do n't provide any employment at the territory's fish processing plants. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Auzou </PERSON>, captain of the Grand <PERSON> Hermine </PERSON>, said his ship as well as the other trawler, the Coma Peche, will not move out of the fishing zone around the islands known as 3PS unless they are forced to. `` For a week now we've been insulted and attacked, we never once answered back,'' the captain said in an interview with French radio. `` It's over now. We've been humble for too long,'' he said. `` We're not leaving the zone now. The decision has been taken on both trawlers.'' He pointed out that French fishermen have been operating in the area for centuries. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> officials agreed to move the Grand Hermine out of the zone so talks could begin between French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and a delegation from the islands. There was no immediate comment from the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> government. `` The union will take action if the trawler does n't follow the government's instructions,'' said <PERSON> Dodeman </PERSON>. `` They will prepare the boat to go against the Grand Hermine on the 3PS.'' <PERSON> Dodeman </PERSON> said it will take about six hours for the local trawler, <PERSON> Croix </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON>, to reach St. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>'s harbor. He would not say what action the fishermen had in mind. In recent weeks some fishermen have threatened to ram the large factory freezer trawler or shoot the radar equipment on its bridge. On Sunday, fishermen blocked planes carrying 60 French police reinforcements from landing. More than 1,000 people turned out Monday night for a public meeting and voted to accept the French government's offer for talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> about fishing rights in the region. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>, who is also the territory's senator to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said a delegation would go to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on condition the French government agrees to tie up one of the two trawlers at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> harbor. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> government agreed Tuesday that a French naval tug anchored off <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> will carry a local observer and stay with the trawler Grand Hermine to monitor it. In St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, the two French military planes that had tried to bring in police reinforcements to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miquelon </LOCATION> on Sunday flew out Tuesday morning. Their flight plans were filed to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION> residents, some armed with rifles, surrounded one plane that landed Sunday but allowed it to take off after four hours. The second plane circled overhead before also flying to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have a longstanding dispute over fishing quotas and the islands' international boundary. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> long has complained of French over-fishing. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> disagree over the international boundary of the islands and quotas for fish in nearby waters. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> claims a 200-mile economic zone, but <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> recognizes only a 12-mile limit around the islands.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Ease Currency Restrictions With East Bloc</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has agreed to foreign currency exchange with some <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies and may lower its domestic exchange rates as a prelude to full convertibility in world markets, an official said Tuesday. The deputy chairman of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of the U.S.S.R, V.A. <PERSON> Pekshev </PERSON>, told a U.N.-sponsored conference on U.S.-Soviet trade that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials acknowledge the need for full convertibility of the ruble but must proceed slowly. `` By Jan. 1, 1990, we would make a 100 percent increase in the ratio'' of the official domestic exchange rate, <PERSON> Pekshev </PERSON> said, in effect doubling the amount of rubles exchanged for other currencies. `` Is this a currency devaluation?'' he said. `` We wo n't get into theoretical arguments on this question.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has several sets of exchange rates for domestic and foreign products, and it was not known how the proposed increase would affect the rates. Black market exchange rates are often six to seven times higher than the official rates. More than 100 Americans and Soviets, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet envoys to the world body, began the two-day meeting Tuesday, the first such conference held under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet speakers focused mainly on Soviet economic reforms and repeatedly expressed optimism about improving relations. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, has led to an explosion of cooperative business ventures and the relaxation of some restrictions on foreign trade. But ventures have been stifled by the inconvertibility of the ruble in foreign exchange markets and by the need to operate through the Soviet state bank, which takes as much as 60 percent of hard currency earnings from each transaction. Western media have reported the possibility of changes in the official rate, which currently brings about $ 1.60 per ruble. One Soviet official has said convertibility could result in a 10-fold devaluation in the ruble. <PERSON> Pekshev </PERSON> dismissed the 10-fold figure as speculative and said officials were considering ways to move to full convertibility `` stage by stage.'' `` We're not in a position today to assert a new value of the ruble to the dollar,'' he said. He said Soviets `` have agreed to partial convertibility'' with several East European countries and were planning hard currency `` auctions'' for Soviet and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc enterprises to buy the foreign currency needed for trade with the West. Foreign businesses initially will not be allowed to participate, he said. The conference is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon, two days before President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have said they are planning a wide-ranging review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before deciding on a new agenda for relations under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jumped from $ 214 million in 1982 to $ 446 million the next year and were projected to dip slightly to $ 445 million in 1987, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> decreased from $ 3.4 billion in 1984 to a projected $ 1.3 billion in 1987. Another statement said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to extend visas for Soviets wishing to continue meeting with American corporations after the conference ends. Among the U.S.-based participants in the meeting were <PERSON> Duco </PERSON> <PERSON> Akkerman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Braxmaier </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; F.E. <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, director of international development for the <LOCATION> U. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> S. </LOCATION> oil company <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>. Soviet officials also included the deputy minister of external economic relations and head of the Soviet delegation, Y.N. <PERSON> Chumakov </PERSON>; Deputy Oil Minister L.I. <PERSON> Filimonov </PERSON>; <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponomarev </PERSON>, the Soviet trade representative; and Soviet U.N.

 A 10-year-old boy arrested for selling crack on a street corner on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was ordered held Tuesday at a children's shelter because he had failed to show up in court on two previous arrest warrants. The youngster, wearing blue jeans with a rolled-up comic book in his back pocket, began to cry when court officers led him away in handcuffs following the 30-minute hearing. A 14-year-old accomplice, arrested with him on Sunday on drug-selling charges, was released in the custody of his mother following his arraignment Tuesday. Suffolk Family Court Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> ordered the 10-year-old boy detained despite a plea from his mother that she would see to it that he returned for his next court appearance. <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> told the woman that her son had failed to show up on two outstanding arrest warrants even though she also had been subpoenaed. The boy's court-appointed attorney, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, entered an innocent plea on the youth's behalf. The mother left the courtroom sobbing after watching her son led away. The boy was ordered held at the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Shelter in <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION> until his next court hearing on Jan. 20. The 14-year-old, who has an outstanding arrest warrant for allegedly stealing a bicycle, was ordered to appear in court March 2. Both youngsters were arrested after they had been observed by police allegedly dealing drugs on a street corner in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, a town of 18,000 people about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As the youths tried to flee, the 10-year-old dropped a bag containing three crack vials worth $ 20 each, police said. One of the youths also had $ 226 in cash in his pocket, police said. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> police said they are seeking a suspect who is believed to have hired the boys to sell the drugs. Family Court proceedings are usually closed to the public but <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> opened the arraignment after reporters argued for the public's right to know. The judge ordered that the identities be kept private. He also did not disclose details of the two arrest warrants against the 10-year-old.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager was held hostage by two prison escapees during an 11-day, 4,000-mile crime spree because he could drive with a stick shift and they could not, a sheriff's spokesman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a 16-year-old honor student, was kidnapped Jan. 3 by two escapees from the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and released unharmed Saturday night near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, officers said. He returned home safely to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> just before midnight Monday. Authorities were still searching for the accused abductors, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cokley </PERSON>, 22. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s kidnappers could n't drive a manual transmission car and failed in several attempts to steal another car, <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ergle </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday. So they kept <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> as their getaway driver as they staged robberies in eight <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states, he said. The teen-ager did not attend the news conference. While <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was running an errand for his mother in the <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> area on Jan. 3, he was choked nearly unconscious, shoved into his family's 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and ordered to drive north on Interstate 75, <PERSON> Ergle </PERSON> said. The kidnappers committed robberies and burglaries in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says most of the robberies occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` The car was a very important part of the crime spree because there were several failed attempts to steal another car,'' he said. `` They were concerned about the manner in which the car was driven,'' said <PERSON> Ergle </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> attempted to drive for about 100 miles, but the two became frustrated and did not want to attract attention.'' <PERSON> Ergle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> told investigators he had made up his mind to do everything he could to protect the car. `` This car was a very important part of their life. They had saved money ... and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> felt a real strong responsibility to his mother and his family at whatever the cost to return home with that car,'' <PERSON> Ergle </PERSON> said. The vehicle was last seen with the kidnappers, who dropped off <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. During the burglaries, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> was ordered to stay in the car and the keys were taken from him. The three slept in woods, shopping centers and parking lots during the 11-day odyssey, often going long stretches without food. The teen-ager told investigators he was allowed to call his mother from a convenience store near <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to say he would be freed in a few days. `` I prayed every day and it seemed to work out,'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said after arriving home.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, an American charged with drug and weapons trafficking, said she will ask the judge in the case to move proceedings to <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s hometown in northern <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, who has been linked to an illegal arms-supply network aiding the Nicaraguan rebels, was arrested at his ranch last Thursday. Officials said he also was being investigated on charges of spying for the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras. Attorney <PERSON> Elda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, who suffers from diabetes, became ill on Monday and was sent to the infirmary at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, where he is being held. The jail is in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s condition improved and he was back in his cell Tuesday, Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said. She did not say why <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> became ill. Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said she will ask Judge <PERSON> Leovigildo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the 4th <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to order the proceedings moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlos </LOCATION>, about 105 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch is in nearby <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION>. The judge will decide on the request during an open hearing scheduled for Friday, Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said. The Office of Judicial Investigations acted after residents near <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch denounced activities by <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> that they believed could endanger relations with <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, an official with the office said. The Attorney General's Office formally charged <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, about 69 and a former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> resident, has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for 20 years. Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said he became a naturalized Costa Rican citizen eight years ago, when he moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chiles </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said she would move for dismissal of the drug charges because they were based on alleged incidents that occurred in 1984, about three years before <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s legislature approved an anti-narcotics trafficking law upon which the prosecution is based. `` According to our Constitution, Article 34, no citizen can be accused of things that occurred before 1987, the year in which the legislative assembly approved the narcotics law,'' she said. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has denied any drug trafficking connections. He said in 1986 that authorities twice raided his home in unsuccessful attempts to find evidence of gun running and drug smuggling. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has acknowledged permitting the Contras to use his ranch property for their activities before the Iran-Contra case broke in 1986. In the case, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials sent arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for money to be sent to the Contras. Witnesses testifying before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on illegal arms shipments to the Contras have said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s ranch was a way station for gun smugglers and cocaine traffickers. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was not among 13 men indicted in September in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of running an illegal arms network for the Contras. Reports said <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> was granted immunity by the special prosecutor in the case.

<HEAD>Meese Violated Ethical Standards, Justice Department Report Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Adds 2 grafs of reax from Wallach attorney</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concluded Tuesday that former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> violated federal ethics standards five times in six years and that his relationship with <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` dictated government action'' in major cases. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and his efforts on behalf of a proposed <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil pipeline involved `` three instances in which friendship'' between him and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> caused federal actions, said the report by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who collected $ 1.3 million from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 to 1986, is awaiting trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on racketeering and other charges. He is accused of peddling his <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> connection. `` As a direct result of the preferential, improper efforts of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff, the Army'' awarded a $ 32 million engine-building contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was counselor to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the ethics report on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also violated ethics requirements, the report said, by failing to report a stock sale on his 1985 federal tax return and by participating in a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision favoring the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies in which he held $ 14,000 in stock at the time. If <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> were still attorney general, `` we would recommend -LRB- to the next ranking department official -RRB- that the president take disciplinary action,'' the report concluded. A department statement said no further action against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is warranted because he is no longer a government employee. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> decided last summer not to prosecute <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, although <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably twice violated conflict-of-interest laws in connection with his Bell holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to report the stock sales. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report `` far from vindicates Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' said the new <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` It details conduct which should not be tolerated of any government employee, especially not the attorney general of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disagreed with one aspect of the report, saying that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s failure to dispose of his financial interest in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies resulted from a failure to get adequate legal advice rather than from intent to violate ethics standards. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes `` this report was unnecessary, partly because Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been in the office for some time and partly because it was unwarranted.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes his longtime friend did nothing wrong. The former attorney general, who resigned last year, immediately attacked the report through his attorneys, who called it `` a travesty of justice.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said there is an `` emotional undertone'' to the report that seems designed `` to slam him personally.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> declined to defend his department's Office of Professional Responsibility from criticism by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s supporters that the report was a personal attack on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is entitled to some peace,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> tried to avoid characterizing the <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> report in any way, but ultimately called one of its conclusions `` clearly wrong'' and said there is an adequate factual basis for the others. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disagreed with the conclusion <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated ethical standards when he failed to sell $ 14,000 in stock of regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies while participating in department decisions affecting them. He said there is an `` adequate factual basis'' for finding in four instances that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated ethics standards. But <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that in regard to the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> either did n't get adequate legal advice or did n't follow it. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> characterized that as a mistake, saying `` I've done that myself sometimes. People make mistakes. We're all human.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> emphasized that the findings in the report were those of <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION>, not of the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, according to the report, violated ethical standards which require government employees to avoid the appearance of impropriety when carrying out official duties. But <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said such a requirement is `` a lousy standard.'' He said appearance is a `` subjective matter. It is not an objective measure. What appears improper to one person may look OK to another.'' `` He had a close personal relationship with Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>. `` I do n't see why you can begrudge somebody of those friendships.'' The report notes at least 600 contacts between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> beginning in 1981. It says that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> personal injury lawyer, showered <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> with letters and memos on topics ranging from a `` diet program'' for the stocky presidential counselor to business arrangements, while meeting with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in some cases twice a day. Many of the memos, coming in `` a virtual torrent'' while <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was counselor to the president, contain `` a strong undercurrent'' in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was `` seeking action'' from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff `` in matters in which he had a financial interest,'' said the report. It said the letters and memos from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> either confirm a close personal relationship or `` reveal a level of presumptuousness on the part of Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> which exceeded that which one would think humanly possible.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> suggested in one letter moving <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> to a new job, with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> becoming her replacement. He also sent <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a proprosed draft for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1983 State of the Union address and suggested in another memo a way to increase <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s power. He recommended moving then-White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and assigning then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the case in which the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> awarded a huge contract to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the report said, `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff injected themselves ... as a direct result of the friendship between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'' into a financial problem <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was having with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s intervention, including a phone call to then-Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldridge </PERSON>, was `` precisely'' the type of activity prohibited by a federal executive order spelling out ethical standards for federal employees, the report said. On the oil pipeline, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, again at <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s urging, arranged a meeting in 1985 for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and his client, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, with then-White House National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> in an attempt to help secure an insurance package that would support the project, the report said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> simply asked <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was being treated fairly on the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> engine contract and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` did n't participate'' in resolving the problem surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had little involvement in the pipeline project. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> put all this in writing. We know there's nothing wrong,'' emphasizing, `` The report is old news.''

<HEAD>Thousands March To Protest Economic Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of workers and students marched through the streets of the capital and other cities Tuesday demanding wage increases and protesting government economic policies. The march in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> was preceded by a rally and was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Bolivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, which says road blocks and strikes will follow. Similar marches took place in other cities in the interior, radio stations reported. Planning Minister <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said the government has included a 15 percent wage increase in its new budget and can not offer more. `` One can not wring water from rocks,'' he said in response to Workers Central wage demands. Speakers at Tuesday's rally called the government wage program `` inhuman'' and said it spells starvation for many. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s minimum monthly wage is $ 40, but many food prices are comparable to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The conservative government of President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> says keeping a lid on wages is essential to the success of its economic program. The government has lowered inflation from 24,000 percent four years ago to 21 percent by firing 23,000 miners, closing unproductive mines, imposing strict wage controls and lifting all price controls. Social unrest has been kept in check through an emergency wage program financed by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and foreign governments. Tens of thousands of workers have been employed building roads, schools, irrigation systems and rural clinics.

<TEXT>
 About 150 poor people, their problems multiplied by the national economic crisis, Tuesday looted a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> warehouse of food and clothing intended for victims of Hurricane Joan, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Managua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said the group broke into the warehouse through the roof. He said he did not have an estimate on the value of items taken. A police official said on condition of anonymity, `` There were no arrests because we had limited forces there and it was impossible for more people to climb up on the warehouse.'' An AP photogapher who happened to pass the warehouse during the looting reported seeing people carrying away armfuls of canned food and clothing. Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> slammed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast on Oct. 21, killing about 100 people and leaving an estimated 200,000 homeless. Property damage was estimated at more than $ 700 million. Few in the capital were affected. But many of the thousands who suffered property damages in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s rural areas since have moved to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The Sandinista government says the hurricane worsened the country's economic crisis. It also has blamed the crisis on eight years of civil war with the U.S.-supported anti-Sandinista rebels, known as the Contras. At the <ORGANIZATION> Mercado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> in the city's east section, it is common to see dozens of people rummaging through trash cans for food. National inflation last year topped 20,000 percent, and the government announced numerous devaluations of the official currency, the cordoba, to keep the country's economy afloat. On Jan. 3, the government devalued the cordoba again, this time by 120 percent. It raised gasoline prices by 125 percent and bus fares 50-fold. The government also announced a spending reduction program that would lay off thousands of public workers, cut defense spending by 27 percent and slash police services 40 percent. The government has not authorized salary increases although prices on many basic goods have risen as much as 50 percent since the latest devaluation.

<HEAD>Police Officers Indicted In Killing Of Three Dissidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A civilian court has charged two national police officers with murdering three family members in a 1986 raid on the suburban home of a popular leftist folk singer. The <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santiago </ORGANIZATION> indicted Lt. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gajardo </PERSON> and Sgt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> on homicide charges Monday in connection with the midnight raid on June 30, 1986, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspapers reported Tuesday. Police Lt. Col. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobarzo </PERSON> was charged with covering up the crime. Shot dead were the wife, sister-in-law and 16-year-old son of <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, whose songs attack the right-wing military government of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Police first said the three committed suicide to avoid arrest. They said they raided the house after being tipped off that it was a clandestine medical clinic for a leftist urban guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodriguez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Human rights and dissident groups maintained the three were gunned down. The Appeals Court ruling said information gathered by investigators indicates `` the deaths of the three victims were caused by third parties,'' the newspapers reported, and that <PERSON> Gajardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> `` appear to be the authors of the crime.'' The ruling reversed a judge's decision not to pursue charges in the case. The officers were expected to appeal. Human rights groups say killings in political raids by police have occurred repeatedly during <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15-year rule. Officers have been indicted or tried in only a handful of cases and convictions are extremely rare.

 A federal judge agreed Tuesday to determine whether two <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union officials must forfeit their positions because they were convicted in an embezzlement scheme. Lawyers agreed to let Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> decide the issue, and the judge set up a two-month timetable for attorneys to submit motions. The two convicted Teamsters officials, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, can keep their jobs in the meantime. The two were convicted Friday. In a separate <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> case, five union members in Local 436 have been indicted on federal racketeering, theft, and embezzlement charges, related to the theft of $ 259,000 from the local's welfare fund, federal officials said Tuesday. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> announced the indictment of <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busacca </PERSON>; his son, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busacca </PERSON>; <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanese </PERSON>; <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiboni </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paventi </PERSON>. No court date has been set. The indictments were returned by a special federal grand jury Dec. 5 but were ordered sealed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Streepy </PERSON> until after the trial of <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, 66, became <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s most powerful <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union member last summer after the death of Teamsters international President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> on July 9. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>'s numerous union positions include the international vice presidency and the presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. His positions pay more than $ 500,000 a year. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 52, holds three union positions that pay about $ 160,000 annually. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was indicted May 16, 1986, along with <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, but died before going to trial. The indictment listed the union offices of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> as being subject to forfeiture after a conviction. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> declined to comment Tuesday after the verdict. Before leaving the federal court building Tuesday, he shook hands with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jigger </PERSON> and said: `` I know you had a job to do, and I can appreciate that.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> commented publicly for the first time Tuesday on the verdict. `` They explained everything to me and I still do n't understand it. We will continue to fight,'' he said. `` I do n't think we are guilty, and I do n't understand how they would come up with a verdict like that.'' <PERSON> Jigger </PERSON> told reporters he will try to have <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> removed from their union positions. `` It was a six-year effort and we are pleased with the outcome,'' said Jigger, also commenting publicly for the first time. `` Judge <PERSON> White </PERSON> gave everyone a full and fair trial, and justice was done. It shows the system worked.'' <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was convicted of embezzlement, labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit labor racketeering and filing a false report to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. He could be sentenced to as many as 46 years in prison and fined up to $ 70,000. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> was convicted of embezzlement, labor racketeering and conspiracy to commit labor racketeering. He faces up to 45 years imprisonment and a fine of up to $ 60,000. White has not set a sentencing date. The jury found <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> guilty of participating in a payroll padding scheme. The indictment alleged the $ 700,000 embezzlement took place between 1972 and 1981.

 Teachers voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to end the first strike in the school system's history, accepting a three-year contract. School was to resume Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Akron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegferth </PERSON> said 98 percent of the 2,000-member teachers union voted to accept the contract.

The pact gives teachers raises of 2.75 percent retroactive to the start of this school year, 3.25 percent in 1989-90 and 4 percent in 1990-91. It also includes improved medical and dental coverage. The 34,000 students in the district will make up missed class time during spring break in April, and will attend school an additional day in March and three days in June.

<TEXT>
 `` Genesis: Music and Miracles,'' a retelling of five medieval mystery plays, is not very musical and more mundane than miraculous. This Old Testament song and dance, which opened Tuesday off-Broadway at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, sounds like it was spawned in the late 1960s. The production has the earnestness but not the conviction of street theater, the relentless beat but not the soaring melodies of such pop musicals as `` Godspell'' and `` Jesus Christ Superstar'' and the simplicity but not the charm of story theater. Five episodes are told in a quick 95 minutes _ the creation and the fall of <PERSON> Lucifer </PERSON>, the creation and fall of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve, the murder of <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> and the Flood and the story of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. The results are painless and occasionally pleasant but nothing more. The stories, adapted by A.J. <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, unfold in rhymes, many of them awkward and forced. The tales are so well known that they need a little passion, humor and inventiveness to make them fly. They do n't get that here. The best moments come in the story of <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>, and these are supplied by set designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> who has given the actors boards and planks with which to construct a pretty spiffy ark. The designer also supplies some toy animals, wooden figures that are carried onto the boat by the actors. For a musical, the sparse score, which has music by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and lyrics by <PERSON> Antoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, is surprisingly wispy, sort of like the lesser love themes from the Biblical movies of Cecil B. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mille </PERSON>. Still, the large cast remains undefeated by the material. Particularly fine is <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogardus </PERSON> who plays the pivotal roles of <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bogardus </PERSON> has a booming musical comedy voice and is a fine actor. If Broadway had more than two or three musicals a year, he always would find work. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Munger </PERSON>'s Eve is sympathetic and forthright, but she's also saddled with some of the worst lines as <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s shrewish wife. In one novel bit of interpretation, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> almost like a psychotic street tough. His murder of the passive, almost nondescript <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> is brutal, unnerving and hard to watch. The red-haired <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Thacker </PERSON> makes a persuasive Lucifer, a grinning, boyish sprite with a ghoulish smile. Special mention also should be made of young <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> <PERSON> Danner </PERSON> who sings in a clear, crisp style and turns <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> into a credible character and not just the plot device he usually is. The choreography by <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor-Corbett </PERSON> does n't get past minimal and is given mostly to two dancing doubles for <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve. <PERSON> Conklin </PERSON> also designed the costumes, and they include what may be a first for the supposedly naked First Couple _ anatomically correct, flesh-colored body stockings. A very strange cover-up. Except for those inventive glad rags, ` Genesis: Music and Miracles'' offers very little that is surprising or memorable once the house lights have gone back up.

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders adopted a resolution on trade union pluralism early Wednesday after a 17-hour debate, state radio reported, in a move that could open the way for legalizing Solidarity. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was urged to offer legalization to the banned independent union movement if it declares itself part of socialism and refrains from opposing the government. But the proposal presented to the committee by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> had so many conditions it appeared unlikely the union federation, banned since 1982, would accept it. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said Solidarity also would have to observe a two-year strike moratorium and give up financial aid from the West amounting to millions of dollars. The meeting of the 230-member committee began at 10 a.m. Tuesday. A commentator on state television said the debate proved `` long, sharp and very hot.'' State radio reported at 3 a.m. Wednesday -LRB- 9 p.m. EST Tuesday -RRB- that the session just ended and the committee adopted stances concerning political and trade union pluralism. No immediate details of the resolutions passed were available. The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said a package of proposals on reforming the party passed unanimously, and the leadership's stand on trade union and political pluralism was approved by a majority. It did not elaborate. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other spokesmen for the union movement declined official comment on <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s proposal and were not immediately available for their reaction on the committee's decision But a Solidarity source in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity that <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s offer at first glance appeared unclear and the conditions he set `` unacceptable'' or even `` laughable.'' He cited specifically the requirement that Solidarity declare itself to be socialist and that it refrain from all strikes. He said Solidarity must be able to function as a free trade union movement. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had demanded the authorities agree to recognize the labor movement before he talks with them on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. He warned that social moods were becoming explosive because of rising prices and shortages in stores. A strike demanding higher pay and legalization of Solidarity meanwhile closed the 1,100-worker <ORGANIZATION> Pabianice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fabric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> in the central city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>. The strike was confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. State news media noted that the deliberations were strained. <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was quoted as saying a `` full-blooded'' verbal duel was going on between <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and official unions chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>. Both men are on the ruling Politburo. `` It was very hot,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told a TV interviewer. The discussion marked a key moment for the party and Solidarity as communist leaders struggled to decide whether to risk repeating the experiment of 1980 that permitted the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first legal, independent union movement. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> addressed specific questions to Solidarity. He said the answers would determine if the union could be seen as a partner, thereby `` opening the process of legalization,'' or as a `` political opponent with whom one has to carry constant political struggle.'' The questions included whether the union would `` see itself as an integral part of socialism'' and whether it intends to act as a trade union or as a political movement or party. He also asked what position Solidarity would have toward anti-communist Polish groups and whether it would be a `` foreign agent'' by continuing to accept money from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other foreign organizations. `` I am putting all these problems in an unambiguous way because I aim at avoiding any kind of ambiguity. The problems are too serious to allow ambiguities,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. He said the legalization process should be preceded by signing of a detailed `` social accord'' among trade unions, political parties and various clubs and associations. The agreement could include provisions detailing planned social and economic reforms and establishing a `` civic body'' to settle disputes among the signatories, he said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the economy would be the most important factor for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in the coming years. `` It above all needs order and peace,'' he said. `` Even the best administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the ... economy becomes a field of political struggles.'' After a 16-month period of freedom for millions of Solidarity supporters, the union was suspended in a 1981 martial-law crackdown and later banned. But the results have proved disappointing for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders. The economy has stagnated, foreign creditors have been unsympathetic, and reforms have been hamstrung by the refusal of many workers to participate as long as Solidarity is illegal. <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON>, a new party secretary, took the floor to begin the second day of the debate and said he endorsed the Politburo stand on union pluralism, backing allowing more than one legal union. Such pluralism is a `` social necessity,'' <PERSON> Czarzasty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolomyjski </PERSON>, the manager of the huge <ORGANIZATION> Katowice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mill </ORGANIZATION>, warned that competing unions threaten `` anarchy and divided work crews.'' Other speakers opposed allowing unions other than the government-sponsored OPZZ alliance. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has granted Solidarity $ 1 million a year for the last two years, but Polish authorities have held up spending of half of this. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Solidarity was estimated last year at $ 5 million by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity does not deny getting foreign help. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would take money from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> if he could use it to defend trade union freedoms.

 Police said Tuesday they have identified the baggage container in which a bomb was planted aboard <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said authorities believe it was first loaded in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The jetliner blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. `` We have now identified the baggage container within the aircraft in which the explosive device was placed, and substantial forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this regard,'' Detective Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the Scottish detective heading the investigation, told a news conference. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> refused to comment on whether the bomb was put on the plane in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or on who police suspect planted it. But early copies of Wednesday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> available Tuesday night reported: `` No details of the container, what else it held, where it was discovered or where it originated were given officially but police and accident investigators are now convinced that it was in luggage first loaded at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.'' New York-bound Flight 103 originated in that West German city, transferring passengers and baggage to another plane on arrival at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport. The Times said police think the bomb was no more than a few pounds of Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosive. It said they think once a hole was blown in the side of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and the electronics bay, the plane's nerve center, was destroyed, the air pressure at 31,000 feet ripped the aircraft apart. Investigators say the explosion occurred in the cargo area just in front of the left-hand wing. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said about 10,000 items from the plane were recovered in searches across <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said on Dec. 28 that investigators found evidence of a bomb in the framework of a metal luggage pallet, the rack on which baggage is secured. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said Scottish police are working with police in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He mentioned investigations in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> but would not elaborate. `` This investigation is widening on an international scale and over 3,000 witness statements have been collated,'' he said. He was asked about a report in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoting former Israeli intelligence official <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> as saying he was sure the May 15 Palestinian group was responsible. `` There has been a lot of comment, some ill-informed, and I do not think it would be helpful to identify any group,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. Transport Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has said the bomb probably contained Semtex, a powerful and hard-to-detect plastic explosive made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> agreed the explosive was `` a plastic of a high-technology type,'' but would not confirm it was Semtex. Special Agent <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendershot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Helge </PERSON> <PERSON> Tepp </PERSON> of West German police also attended the news conference. <PERSON> Hendershot </PERSON> said he was happy with the investigation's progress. <PERSON> Tepp </PERSON> noted that only the prosecutor heading the inquiry in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> was authorized to give information on the progress of inquiries there. In <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Tuesday his <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is aiding the investigation. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkind </PERSON>, secretary for <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the government will meet all costs in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, where 10 homes were destroyed and 30 badly damaged in the crash. He said in a letter to local legislator Sir <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Monro </PERSON> that the cost of policing, emergency services and social work will be $ 12 million, besides $ 1.77 million already pledged for new homes and a fund for those who lost relatives.

The accident occurred about 2 p.m. Sheriff's rescue boats and volunteers in boats took the injured to the hospital, Ms. <PERSON> Wegner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Federal Appeal Court Bars Religious Club Meetings At School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high school can not allow students to hold regular religious meetings in a classroom shortly before the school day starts, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. The ruling by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in a case from <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, has implications for the Equal Access Act, a 1984 federal law that requires public secondary schools to allow religious clubs to meet at school on the same basis as other extracurricular clubs. The court stopped short of declaring the law unconstitutional, saying instead that the <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> school system was n't affected by the law because it barred all non-curricular clubs from meeting on campus. But the court also indicated that any on-campus religious meetings would probably violate the constitutional requirement of separation of church and state. `` The district must exclude organized religious speech because use of public school facilities for religious purposes violates the Establishment Clause'' of the Constitution, which forbids a state establishment of religion, said Judge <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> in the 3-0 decision. If the ruling stands, the Equal Access Act `` has been functionally rendered impotent and would n't apply in virtually any public high school setting,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON>, lawyer for a group of high school students in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb. He said he would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Slonim </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling may be the first by any federal appeals court on the issue but is consistent with a number of lower-court decisions around the nation. `` Since early in the 19th century we've had a tradition of trying to separate religion from public schools so public schools can serve people of a wide variety of religious beliefs,'' <PERSON> Slonim </PERSON> said. He described the `` equal access'' approach as an attempt to avoid the constitutional ban on preferential treatment of religion, but said it inevitably `` sends a message of religious partisanship in the schools.'' <PERSON> McFarland </PERSON> said about 25 students applied in the fall of 1984 to use a classroom at <ORGANIZATION> Lindbergh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for before-school meetings of a non-denominational Christian student group for religious and moral discussions, Bible readings and prayer. The principal and school district denied the request, citing constitutional standards as well as a district policy that allowed classroom meetings only if the purposes were `` an extension of a specific program or course offering.'' The students also were rejected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, whose ruling was upheld Tuesday. `` Permitting this student religious group to meet in a public high school just before the start of classes would impermissibly advance rather than neutrally accommodate religion,'' <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said in the appeals court decision. He said the meetings would take place `` at a time closely associated with a highly structured school day,'' creating an appearance of school sponsorship. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 allowed a student religious group equal access to a university's facilities, the same standards do not apply to public high schools, <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. High school students are required to attend school and `` are less mature and more impressionable than university students,'' <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> said. `` Teachers at high schools, unlike college professors, are both educators and authority figures.'' He also said the meetings would improperly `` entangle'' the government with religion, because teachers, required by district policy to supervise all student activities on campus, might either interfere with or advocate religious activities as the club's supervisor

 The families of three <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> workers killed in an explosive fire at an MX missile motor assembly building filed a $ 9 million negligence suit Tuesday against the federal government. The lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeks $ 3 million each in general and specific damages for the wives and children of <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, 29, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodsell </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 24. The lawsuit, filed jointly by <PERSON> Lorene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodsell </PERSON> and <PERSON> DiAnna </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, contends their husbands' deaths resulted from government negligence in implementing and monitoring safety standards at the MX facility. Specifically cited in the suit were the establishment and maintenance of mandatory criteria, standards and methods for procedures involving the manufacturing of the MX motors. The plaintiffs also claimed government negligence in holding regular inspections of the premises to ensure that procedures were being followed by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, and that the government neglected to warn employees or stop work in the event noncompliance was discovered. The victims and two other <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> employees had been manually removing the steel core from a casting of a first-stage missile motor when 100,000 pounds of solid rocket propellent ignited in a fireball Dec. 29, 1987, at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> plant 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Four of the men were killed instantly, and <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> died 11 hours later. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said in a report three months after the accident that the fire was caused either by friction or static electricity. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> report concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> had failed to provide an adequate remote-control system or fully implement other safety measures recommended after a `` near miss'' six months earlier that consisted of a flash and release of fumes during the same procedure. A telephone call to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after business hours Tuesday for comment on the suit was not answered. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> was cited for six safety violations and fined $ 31,700 by the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The company vowed to appeal violations alleging serious and willful deviations from division rules, but company spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Tuesday he was not sure if the appeal was filed and the fine reduced.

 Stuttering, once thought to be psychological, has been linked to brain abnormalities by scientists who hope to understand many disorders by making 3-D videotapes of the brain in action.

<TEXT>
 In this corner `` USA Today: The Television Show,'' fast on its feet, but dragging the baggage from its inauspicious debut in September. In the other corner is the plodding `` Inside Edition,'' a knockoff of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` A Current Affair'' that King World hopes will knock `` USA Today'' out of the ring. The decisive round between the two syndicated shows is expected during the February sweeps when local ratings are measured. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' barely survived the November sweeps and has suffered station defections and time changes, sometimes in favor of the new `` Inside Edition'' and the old `` A Current Affair.'' `` USA Today: The Television Show'' premiered last fall after months of hype and a $ 40 million investment by the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in partnership with Grant Tinker. The producers promised state-of-the-art graphics and a format that would change the face of television news. In retrospect, there was no way the show could live up to expectations _ but it was n't expected to be so bad, either. Overproduced and whizzing by at a frantic pace, its anchormen and women were stranded on an unpopulated, space-age set, talking to disembodied images on big-screen television monitors. The new version is much better. Brief updates on stories of the day are delivered by grounded anchors who have been allowed to sit down _ phew! _ behind a desk that does not spin, gyrate or sprout statistics. Its light-hearted features benefit from the impressive graphics. The flash and the likable, telegenic hosts remain. If this were the show that had premiered in September, it still would n't have lived up to the build-up, but reviews would not have been nearly so negative. But those negative reviews did hit newsstands, and King World, the successful syndicator of `` Wheel of Fortune,'' `` The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> Show'' and `` Jeopardy!'' soon thereafter announced it was gunning for `` USA Today: The Television Show'' with `` Inside Edition,'' to premiere in January. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' had proven there was a market for a syndicated newsmagazine. It had sold in 95 percent of the country weeks before a single show was produced, thanks to the cast behind the scenes _ former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Tinker, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, and former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' show executive producer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>. When the show fell flat, <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> figured to step in and pick up the market. But GTG stuck by the show, hired <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON> as new executive producer and announced a massive repromotion _ at a cost of $ 4 million _ to herald the re-created program. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' is far from the the sure thing it once seemed. `` Inside Edition'' has been picked up as a midseason replacement in markets covering 71 percent of the country. The Kings enlisted the producers of `` A Current Affair'' and hired well-known TV personality <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> as host. But `` Inside Edition'' was n't exactly impressive in its premiere, either. In comparison to `` USA Today: The Television Show,'' the set looked like community-access cable. The content was a mish-mash of previously covered sob stories. Frost concluded the show with an embarrassing promise of `` no three-headed babies, no programs devoted to issues like, should one-legged lesbians be allowed to adopt ferrets, no sex surveys, and hopefully, no broken noses for the host.'' If `` Inside Edition'' is wavering, the new `` USA Today: The Television Show'' has settled down. `` Welcome to the new look of ` <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today on TV,''' said co-host <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Macatee </PERSON> as the show re-premiered on Jan. 9. `` A new look for a new year.'' Several of the pieces were an amazing several minutes long _ documentary-length by the standards of the original version. They were pleasant to look at if they were largely mindless. A garden-variety feature on preparations for the inauguration included a pointless film clip from the movie `` No Way Out.'' Another feature delivered the news flash that car stereos louder than a speeding locomotive are bad for drivers and other living things. But the show is at least watchable now. What remains to be seen is whether the improvements are too late. Many stations moved `` USA Today: The Television Show'' into low-rated late-night and gave `` Inside Edition'' the coveted time period just before prime time. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> television market, `` Inside Edition'' premiered on the NBC-owned station at 7:30 p.m. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' has languished since September at 2 a.m. on the CBS station. Neither `` Inside Edition'' nor `` USA Today: The Television Show'' can claim to be great journalism. `` USA Today: The Television Show'' has at least tried to do something new.

<TEXT>
 Since economic thinking periodically succumbs to conventions and fads, it is sometimes revealing and often wise to take an oblique perspective, to look from the side rather than dead on. If you do, you may see some pet notions assume a different appearance, just as people in profile sometimes appear differently than they do face to face. Consider the notion, sometimes expressed by the impatient, that the trade deficit be cleaned up once and for all during the next administration. Why piddle around; let's get it over with. But to do so would mean putting people out of work, lowering real incomes and retarding economic growth. This would severely diminish imports. In theory, it could be done _ but not without domestic and probably worldwide recession. Forced recessions used to be part of economic policy, whether stated or denied, and there are pure economists around who still maintain that a good recession is a wholesome thing for the trade defict. Sort of like a purgative. Today, however, economics is more heavily dosed with politics than it was in the immediate post-World War II years. Recessions, though they will happen, are less likely to be a consequence of abrupt economic policy changes. Another issue deserving of a different perspective is that of exporting jobs. It is a contentious one, often used by labor in criticizing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s economic policy. By importing, it is said, we're shipping jobs abroad. To which one economist, Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, responds: `` Currently, we employ 62.5 percent of our over-16 population, the highest proportion in history. If we're losing jobs to foreigners, it's hard to figure where.'' <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school, suggests that if the thesis had validity the evidence would show up as a decline of manufacturing jobs. But it has n't. Manufacturing employment is strong again. True, he says, there's been a job loss in unionized, protected automotive and steel industries where, he claims, wages were kept artificially high. But jobs in some other manufacturing areas have grown, along with productivity. How about foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an issue that irritates and provokes millions of Americans? As they see it, foreigners are buying up the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's economic warfare, they say, and Americans are losing. This one demands perspective, to wit: One reason net foreign investment has grown is that Americans, themselves, are investing more in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and less abroad. Again, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> explains: `` The reason we are doing this is the same reason there is more foreign investment here _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a very good place to invest!'' From a historical perspective, he adds, growth has been the strongest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during periods of strong foreign investment. When foreigners seek a good thing, they sometimes do a good thing: They make the country grow. Moreover, foreign investment leaves hostages. Plants and buildings they erect in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not be taken home. `` When things sour a bit,'' says the professor, `` We can buy them back at a lower price.'' In the meantime, should n't some thought be given to foreign investment in terms of jobs provided, wages earned, taxes paid, and products put on the competitively priced marketplace? It's only a slightly different perspective from the conventional one, but it suggests the possibilities in taking a second look at what might at first seem to be one-faceted situations.

<HEAD>Solo Inaugural Prayer Is By Longtime Bush Buddy, Graham</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Prayer for presidential integrity and courage by evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> this Friday brackets <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration. The ceremony starts with an invocation of divine assistance and ends with a benediction. `` I'm going to ask God to give the new president strength, courage and wisdom,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> says. `` I'm going to pray that he be given the wisdom to know what's right, and the courage to do it.'' Although inaugural ceremonies ordinarily include prayers by a denominational cross-section of clergy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this time chose for it only the durable evangelist, a long-time friend and vacation companion. `` I do n't know why I'm the only one,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said when asked about it. `` I guess he and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> must have felt I could represent the others. I'm honored to have been selected.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who has been a confidant of presidents ever since <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> in the 1950's, is particularly close to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his family, and has been for about a quarter century. They regularly spend some time together each year at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, also spent a holiday with the Bushes in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became vice president `` I knew his father and used to play golf with him,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> related of the late Sen. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, whose hospitality drew the <ORGANIZATION> Grahams </ORGANIZATION> into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> orbit in the early 1960's. `` We've been close friends of the Bushes for many years,'' related <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, now 70, who in his half-century, globe-girdling career has preached directly to more than 100 million people in more than 65 countries. The new president, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, `` has a huge family. There are a lot of Bushes and Walkers -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mother's maiden name -RRB-. They're all very religious people. I know all the children very well. They're all religious. After dinner at the <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> weekends, he related, `` we all gather in the living room and sit around on the floor. I read some Scipture and the children ask questions about the Bible.'' Asked why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't as openly expressive of his faith as outgoing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, chuckling, `` Well, you see, he's an Episcopalian.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> himself is a Baptist. Of the long line of presidents which <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has been associated, he said, `` I think <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> went to church more than any of them,'' although <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also was a regular church-goer and taught an adult class. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has talked a lot about God,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> observed. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has scrupulously avoided taking sides in presidential campaigns, whatever his personal associations, particularly after a non-committal ceremonial appearance with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> caused accusation of partisanship. At last summers national political conventions, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> led prayers both at the Democratic and Republican affairs. However, while he has been a frequent White House guest and counselor through a string of eight presidents, he has a special niche in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retinue because of their background. `` I think he'll make a far greater president than some people give him credit for,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably has more knowledge of what is going on in the world and more government experience than any man that has ever occupied the White House.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who in recent years has condemned the nuclear arms buildup, said the developing friendlier relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` is one of the great legacies'' being passed on by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> added, `` I definitely think <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will advance this new warmth between our two countries.'' In the inaugural prayer, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said he would quote <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> as saying that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stands on two great pillars _ faith and morality. Without these, our foundation crumbles. `` Sometimes, this seems to be happening, but there also are signs that a new spiritual tide is running in this nation. I'm going to thank God for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and all it stands for. `` I'm also going to say that humantity's promotion comes neither from the East or the West, but from God.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said his inaugural prayer also would ask blessings on <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as Vice President, on his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and for the coninued `` health and service'' of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>.

 When <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black townships erupt in violence, black policemen are in the front lines. When state-of-emergency regulations are enforced, black police are among those imposing the will of white authorities. When anti-apartheid activists target `` government collaborators'' for attacks, black police often are singled out. More than half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 70,000 policemen are black, working for a government that upholds white privilege and living in segregated ccommunities restless for change. `` Blacks are very important to the overall success of the South African Police,'' said <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotze </PERSON>, a white police captain who trains recruits at the black police college in <LOCATION> Hammanskraal </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` Black policemen are seen as part of the apartheid system, enforcing discriminatory laws for their white masters,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nthato </PERSON> <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>, a prominent physician and anti-apartheid activist in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Black policemen generally view themselves as an apolitical group providing an essential service in a country where crime is high. In the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, home to 2.5 million people, more than 10 murders and 25 rapes are reported on an average weekend. `` I'm a professional policeman and my job is to uphold the law,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fanyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwane </PERSON>, a black who has worked in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> since 1969. `` We support the government of the day and do n't get involved in politics.'' Yet black police are a vital link in the government's intelligence network, helping to collect information on political activists who may be detained without trial An estimated 30,000 people have been detained for varying periods during the 31-month emergency and there have been repeated charges of police torture of detainees. Black policemen also are a buffer to reduce the number of confrontations between black citizens and white policemen. `` I do n't think the government trusts black policemen, but it finds them useful in diverting black anger away from white authorities,'' said <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>, the activist. During widespread unrest since 1984, militant activists attacked black police more than any other group associated with the government. The homes of more than 1,000 black policemen were damaged or destroyed and dozens of black police were killed in 1986-87, according to research organizations. One group of militants not only burned an officer's home, but `` so great is the hatred, that they came back the next day with sledgehammers and ... broke down the building to its foundations,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> le </PERSON> <PERSON> Grange </PERSON>, the former law and order minister, said in 1986. Black officers are accessible targets because they live in the townships were most of the unrest occurs and are the most visible government representatives. Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiburi </PERSON>, who lives and works in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, said more than 200 youths surrounded and stoned his house in 1985. <PERSON> Shiburi </PERSON> held the mob at bay by firing shots for 20 minutes until police arrived to rescue him. <PERSON> Shiburi </PERSON> said he knew many of the youths and has spoken to them subsequently. `` They said they wanted to kill me just because I was a policeman, even though I had n't done anything to them personally,'' <PERSON> Shiburi </PERSON> said. Several months later, black students threatened to kill <PERSON> Shiburi </PERSON>'s wife, a high school teacher The couple moved to a different neighborhood, but continued with their jobs. Most policemen receive no special protection, but in some townships they live in barracks surrounded by barbed wire. Despite the occupational hazards, there is no shortage of black volunteers for the police force. Blacks and people of mixed-race make up more than 25,000 of the 60,000-member South African Police, the national force, and virtually all the 10,000 policemen employed by township councils are black. These figures do not include the police in black homelands, where the only white officers are a few top commanders. Most black policemen are from impoverished rural areas, attracted by the prospect of stable employment at a salary far greater than anything available in their hometowns. All policemen, regardless of race, earn a starting monthly salary of about 800 rand -LRB- $ 340 -RRB-. By comparison, beginning mineworkers earn less than 500 rand -LRB- $ 220 -RRB- a month and are among the better-paid black workers. Pay parity for policemen of all races was instituted five years ago and other discriminatory measures also have been eliminated. Until 10 years ago, a white policeman was always in charge when working with a black colleague, even if the black held a higher rank. Now rank alone determines command. As recently as three years ago, black traffic policemen in one province could not issue tickets to white motorists. This also has changed. Several blacks have risen to the rank of colonel. But whites still dominate the officer corps, and blacks are likely to be stationed in black areas. `` I know the people in the township wo n't like me,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluleke </PERSON>, 22, a trainee at the black police college. But, he added, `` This is the best-paying job I could find and I have a chance to advance.'' Fourteen hundred black recruits are trained every six months at the college, while hundreds of applicants are turned away. Of five students interviewed, all said they would have preferred other careers but opted for the police because of the pay. `` My parents and my four sisters are all depending on my wages,'' said <PERSON> Maluleke </PERSON>, explaining that he lacked the money to study to be a teacher. Police recruits are required to have a high school education, but <PERSON> Kotze </PERSON> says many trainees are unsophisticated and have to be trained in some social amenities. Many new policemen, including those raised in tiny villages, are sent directly to urban centers. Critics question whether they are adequately prepared for the turbulence that awaits them. During the recent unrest, police also have hired thousands of `` instant police'' who received only six weeks training. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has conceded that these recruits need better training. But <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON> said that for many blacks the image of the entire police force is beyond repair. `` It is impossible for blacks to trust any policemen under the apartheid system,'' said <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>. `` Blacks are not part of the decision-making process and they will never have faith in anyone who enforces these unjust laws.''

<HEAD>Housing in Cuba: Too Many People for Too Few Dwellings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAVANA, Cuba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, a 25-year-old professional, has put off a decision on whether to marry her boyfriend because that would mean moving in with his family. Her predicament is just one symptom of this country's severe housing shortage: there simply is not enough space to permit young married couples to have their own apartments. As a result, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> must decide whether she wants to continue living with her own family, or get married and move in with that of her prospective husband. Complicating the decision is the fact that she does n't get along with some members of his family. Many residences here have 10 occupants in a space more suitable for three or four. In the <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vedado </LOCATION> section, three families, all related, shared the same two-story home, once the residence of a pre-revolutionary oligarch. Since none of the families got along, they had their respective dinners in shifts _ at 6, 8 and 10 p.m. Eventually, each family found alternate housing, easing what had been a wrenching experience for all concerned. The government claims that every Cuban has a place to live and, indeed, the housing shortage is probably less acute here than in the overwhelming majority of other <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, where homelessness and sub-standard housing are often rampant. But because <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has a different social system, the housing problems and the ways they are dealt with are not the same as they are elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Because young couples often have no privacy due to overcrowded conditions at home, the government runs a string of `` posadas,'' or inns, where they can spend a few hours alone in a modest room for a nominal fee. Occasionally, signs saying `` 2 for 1'' can be seen hanging from apartment building balconies. That can mean that the couple there wants a divorce and is willing to trade their apartment for two smaller ones, one for each partner. In the meantime, until alternate arrangements can be found, such couples often must live under the same roof. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Davalos </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>, admits that this unhappy situation is a `` common'' occurrence in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> but he says usually in cases of marital difficulties, the husband packs up and leaves. An alternate solution is to construct a partition in the house, in effect, converting it into a two-family dwelling. In 1986, President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said he was appalled at the evidence of corruption and profiteering in housing. He discovered that state construction equipment, material and manpower were being used illegally to renovate existing housing, enabling the owners to sell it at big profits. The government struck back by forbidding the sale of housing altogether. Thus, a Cuban family that wanted to move had no choice but to trade houses with another family. Last month, new regulations were instituted which permit the sale of housing once again but only if state inspectors give their approval. Their main interest is to guard against profit-making by home sellers. There are ways for young Cubans to escape from an untenable housing situation. One is to volunteer for a `` microbrigade,'' groups of mostly young Cubans who take leave of their regular job to work at a housing construction site. The workers continue to receive the salary from their normal job and the state provides the equipment and the building materials. The normal workday is 10 hours but it is not unusual, as part of the spirit of self-sacrifice <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> tries to instill in his people, to find these workers on the job 12 to 14 hours a day. For the typical 200 peso a month worker -LRB- about $ 160 at the official rate -RRB-, the long hours mean an income of less than a peso an hour. But the payoff comes when, after two or more years, the `` microbrigadista'' is entitled to move into one of the apartments, at mininal monthly payments, which he or she has helped construct <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>, a taxi driver, worked on a microbrigade at the <LOCATION> Alamar </LOCATION> apartment complex 12 years ago. After two years, he was allowed to move into one of the apartments, paying just 21 pesos a month. The apartment will be all his in four years. The <LOCATION> Alamar </LOCATION> complex has grown to about 30,000 units. <PERSON> Dania </PERSON>, one of 18 women on a 90-person brigade, has spent two years as a construction worker there and the long hours obviously had taken their toll. She looked drawn and tired and said she looked forward to going back soon to her normal eight-hour a day job as a garment worker. But she is luckier than her peers in some other communist countries, such as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where the wait for an apartment sometimes exceeds 20 years. The Cuban government abolished the microbrigade system for a time, then resurrected it two years ago in an effort to meet the increasing demand not only for housing but for day care centers and health clinics as well. In previous years, housing was allocated largely on the basis of need but lately the government has been shifting its philosopy somewhat, showing a preference for workers who demonstrate diligence. Thus, in the competition for new housing, a father of five who is indolent may lose out to an exemplary worker with only two children _ a form of material reward in a country which usually relies on moral incentives to get people to work hard. The microbrigades distribute among themselves half of the apartments they construct. The other half goes to the elderly or to others who are unable to volunteer for such work. During a recent speech, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said the portion of houses allocated to the microbrigades may be raised from 50 percent to 60 percent. Since most of his audience was made up of `` microbrigadistas,'' it was the biggest applause line of his two-hour and 45-minute speech.

<HEAD>Near-Month Oil Futures Soar To Highest Level Since November 1987</HEAD>

 Oil has spurted to a 14-month high in the futures market in a gusher of speculation by traders that oil-producing nations will succeed in controlling their perennial overproduction. The price jump will not spill over onto prices of consumer products such as home heating oil and gasoline unless it lasts for a considerable period of time, analysts say. The February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, jumped 40 cents on Monday to settle at $ 18.88 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The last time the near-month contract settled higher was Nov. 20, 1987, amid hostilities in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war. It settled that day at $ 18.93. Although Persian Gulf troubles no longer are an issue, the price of the near-month contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> has soared 50 percent since an intraday low of $ 12.28 a barrel on Oct. 5. One reason for the increase is speculation that some kind of production agreement may be reached at a meeting beginning Jan. 26 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC countries, according to <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, analysts said the latest surge seemed more the result of emotion than news. `` The main thing we've got getting this market up is momentum. I'd have to list that as the first cause,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's no underlying structural reason. There's no shortage,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtblau </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Prices began rising in October on expectations that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members would agree to cut production as a way of propping up prices. An agreement was reached in late November and took effect Jan. 1. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production has been 19 million barrels a day or slightly more, above its self-imposed quota of 18.5 million barrels but well below December's production. In a sign that many traders expect the surge in oil prices to be short-lived, prices for delivery in later months were significantly lower. The March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> rose 27 cents to $ 17.95 a barrel; the April contract rose 21 cents to $ 17.37 a barrel; and the May contract rose 14 cents to $ 16.98 a barrel. Among refined products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.94 cent to 50.91 cents a gallon and the February contract for No. 2 heating oil rose 0.21 cent to 53.16 cents a gallon. The intraday trading high _ the highest point reached during the trading session _ was $ 18.93 for the February contract for WTI. That topped the 1988 intraday high of $ 18.92 on April 18, which also preceded a meeting between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC nations, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said.

 Five major food companies have joined four others in working toward eliminating highly saturated palm and coconut oils from their products, prompting a multimillionare health crusader to declare victory. `` How much I have had to do with this is for the public to decide,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, who spent $ 2 million on nationwide newspaper ads to promote his cause. `` I know we speeded it up.'' The <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> businessman announced Monday that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to switch to vegetable oils with less saturated fat. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION> said they would stop using the so-called tropical oils in their food products. Saturated fats increase blood cholesterol levels, which are a risk factor for heart attacks. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, 66, blames high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered 22 years ago. None of the companies gave timetables for the reformulation of their products, but many said removal of tropical oils was under way before <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> launched his campaign. In the earlier announcements, some of the companies denied that <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> had any influence on their decision. <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> even denounced <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> as irresponsible for placing the full-page ads, which warned of the `` poisoning of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' through tropical oils. But the latest announcements, in the form of letters to <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> over the past week, were cordial. `` The elimination of tropical fats from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> products is a major priority,'' said a letter from that company, released by <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>. `` Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the American consumer.'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said two major food processors, General Foods and <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION>, have not supported his cause completely. But, he added: `` With nine of the top 11 players in the field, I guess the battle has been won. Millions of ounces of saturated fat wo n't be clogging the arteries of the American public.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Fee </PERSON> said her company, a division of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is testing its existing products to see whether tropical oils can be eliminated, and that 32 out of 35 products it has introduced in the past few years have been free of these oils. `` We are not a holdout,'' she said. But `` it is not something you can do that quickly without making sure the taste and quality is not jeopardized.'' <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> said some Nabisco products also contain lard, which also contains saturated fat. Ms. <PERSON> Fee </PERSON> said the review of the company's product formulations also was looking at whether lard could be removed General Foods, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON> in a letter that it was eliminating tropical oils in all its products except Cool Whip The company said it believes it may not be possible to reformulate the dessert topping to eliminate tropical oils. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>'s initial advertising blitz singled out <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>'s Cracklin' Oat Bran, Sunshine's Hydrox cookies, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperidge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>'s Goldfish crackers, <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION>'s Club crackers, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s Triscuit crackers, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s Crisco shortening, Carnation's Coffeemate and <PERSON> Borden </PERSON>'s Cremora for their tropical `` While most people think they are contributing to their better health by avoiding foods that contain animal fats, many do not know that the tropical oils are as bad or worse,'' he said. `` Palm oil has 25 percent more saturated fat than lard. Coconut oil has 100 percent more.'' Some of the food processors have argued that the tropical oils impart a distinctive flavor and increase their products' shelf life. <PERSON> Sokolof </PERSON>, who made his fortune in his father's construction business, founded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, funding it largely himself.

<HEAD>Few Surprises in Retail Forecasts: More Slow Sales In 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retailers from across the country, gathered for their annual convention, have heard an unsurprising forecast from industry watchers: Sales will remain sluggish in 1989. <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> told storeowners Monday that consumers are optimistic and confident about the economy, but retail sales will increase only 6 percent _ 2.75 percent after inflation. Americans have already put a lot of big purchases behind them, and `` there's much less pent-up demand,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, were upbeat about the economy although they did not expect consumer spending to surge. <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said he saw no signs of a recession this year. He did see some negatives ahead, including a slight worsening of inflation that would help to nudge interest rates higher. But he said he expected interest rates to peak by mid-year. If significant steps are taken to cut the federal budget, rates could decline before year's end, he said. The forecasters spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> NRMA </ORGANIZATION>'s four-day convention here. The delegates included retailers ranging from owners of small shops to executives of the nation's largest storeowner, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> and Co. The economic forecasting session traditionally is one of the biggest of the meeting, drawing thousands of retailers away from the aisles of exhibits set up by cash register manufacturers and credit card companies. Another industry watcher, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected `` more of the same kind of muddling along'' in the economy this year, resulting in a mediocre retail environment. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said, `` I do n't feel good about 5 and 6 percent'' sales increases, recalling that in past years, retailers enjoyed 9 percent or 10 percent gains. Forecasts of consumer spending are critical for retailers, because they must adjust their inventories and expenses in line with how much Americans spend. Economists also watch consumer spending because it accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health. In recent years, consumer spending has increased although retail sales have risen only slightly. Americans have been channeling more dollars into buying homes and cars and into necessities such as food and medical care, leaving less money for discretionary items, which include clothing and furniture. High installment debt has been blamed for some of the retail sales slump, which is nearly 2 years old. But despite the forecasts of higher interest rates, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was unconcerned about consumer debt. Although they may owe more money, buying on credit is such a way of life that `` people are more comfortable with debt,'' she said. <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> both expected job growth to slow. That would affect retailers because new workers have been a primary source of sales increases in recent years. Durable goods, such as cars, furniture and large appliances, would bear the brunt of consumer hesitance, while non-durables, such as food, clothing and gasoline, should see pickups, Ms. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> had a warning for the retailers: No matter what sales do, operating expenses will climb. Storeowners have been paring costs in the past few years to preserve their profits as sales declined. But <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said expenses would spurt higher because as costs of labor, goods and real estate accelerate. The forecasters also said there were many other variables that may affect business during the year, such as the volatile price of oil.

<HEAD>Swimsuit Issues Prove Big Mid-Winter Sellers for Sports Mags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sport magazine's latest issue may have come as a surprise to some faithful readers who were offered a pinup sports calendar rather than `` luscious photos of beautiful women in swimsuits'' a year ago. In a testament to the selling power of mid-winter swimsuit issues, the February Sport has a dark-haired model appropriately dressed for what the headline over the magazine title called its `` Hot Swimsuit Issue.'' The magazine's executives note that new owners _ and a new editor _ have taken over since the last policy pronouncement on swimsuits. <ORGANIZATION> Petersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, bought the magazine last summer. And the new owners say they are giving the predominantly-male sports magazine audience what it wants, as demonstrated by the huge popularity of the swimsuit issues from its rivals, Sports Illustrated and Inside Sports. Sport is reviving its swimsuit issue just weeks before Sports Illustrated celebrates the 25th anniversary of its first swimsuit edition with a blitz that will include a pay-cable program, a home video and a desk calendar. Sports Illustrated designed its initial swimsuit issue as a travel feature to brighten up the dark days between the football and baseball seasons when many Northern cities are snowbound and sports fans are blue. The swimsuit issues periodically have sparked protests that the sections are sexist, exploit women and are unsuited to a sports magazine. Some readers threaten subscription cancellations, although publisher <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said he had fewer than 50 cancellations due to last year's swimsuit issue. Sports Illustrated charges about 28 percent more for ad space and 75 percent more for a single copy of its swimsuit issue. It expects to sell nearly 5.5 million copies of this year's special issue _ which hits the newstands Feb. 6 _ compared with the usual 3 million for regular issues. <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to air a 47-minute video about shooting the swimsuit issue Feb. 9. A slightly longer home video will made available a few days later in video, retail and magazine stores, and retailers have reportedly ordered about 350,000 copies, which will be priced at $ 19.99. Next fall, a special 25th anniversary desk calendar will be published for 1990 using photos taken for the 1989 swimsuit issue. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illustrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said he expects to sell about 250,000 desk calendars at $ 12.95 each in addition to 500,000 of the usual wall calendars at $ 10.95 each. Inside Sports, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, has its ninth swimsuit issue on the newsstands, and hopes to sell 850,000 copies compared with a normal rate base of 500,000. The magazine's first swimsuit issue was a parody of Sports Illustrated's version, showing pretty women in swimwear carrying rolled-up copies of the competition's swimsuit issue. `` It was so well-received that we decided we would keep doing our own every year,'' said marketer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Croft </PERSON>. Sport magazine tried its first swimsuit issue in March 1986, featuring swimsuit-clad women athletes from all fields, but sales failed to improve. In his message to readers last year, then-editor <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> wrote, `` We did n't feel comfortable with the pages, they did n't fit our magazine.'' `` So this month,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> wrote a year ago, `` instead of devoting 16 pages to luscious photos of beautiful women in swimsuits, we give you a 16-page pinup sports calendar. There are no sexy pictures there -LRB- just some remarkable sports photos -RRB-, but you do n't have to hide it from your kid either.'' Sport Publisher <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> is looking for a sales boost _ but wo n't say how much _ in <LOCATION> Sport </LOCATION>'s rate base of 850,000 copies. He makes no apology for the change in philosophy on swimsuit issues. `` What we are showing here is appropriate for a young male audience,'' he said. `` ... It's part of what sports are all about.''

<HEAD>Are Budget Deficits That Bad?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you kept your books the way Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> keeps his, you too might have a big budget deficit, be accused of irresponsibility and urged by your friends to take immediate corrective action. But you and Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> differ in your approach to accounting. It might surprise many people, but the old sprendthrift uses bookkeeping that is more severely restrictive and harder to live by than yours. This is but one of the ways in which, some critics claim, the big federal budget deficits may be overstated, at least with respect to their immediate impact on the strength or weakness of the economy. It is n't at all an apology for the rich uncle's big debts or a reason to continue them. In fact, an unusual spectrum of economists from conservative to liberal agree that regular annual budget deficits must be checked. But, says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, `` unless we understand how the numbers are derived, it is impossible to draw any reliable meaning from them.'' The big difference between you and your uncle is that you keep a capital budget, spreding payments for durable, big-ticket items such as your home and automobile over many years. It's the cash flow-debt service concept. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has no capital budget. It means that whatever the government buys, however long or short its useful life might be, it becomes an immediate expense. It's called cash-based accounting, and it flies in the face of standard accounting practices <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> comments that while a cash-based system may have merit, `` it is simple to the point of being silly when applied to the federal government's operations.'' He estimates, for example, that if capital items were considered in the federal budget, `` we would get better than halfway to a zero balance.'' For an entity that makes significant capital-type expenditures, he explains, the important point to recognize is that a zero balance on a cash system is a stringent budget indeed. `` Cash on the barrelhead for everything!'' Business does n't operate that way. Homeowners do n't attempt to do so. If they did they might be confronted with numbers so horrifying they would sell the house and car and rent the least expensive apartment they could find. Sensibly, they reason that the house and car are good for a few years at a minimum, and that they can space out their payments in affordable units over that time. And that brings up another matter that conceivably lessens the impact of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s deficits. It is inflation, and the declining value of the dollars used to pay off debt. Just as inflation allows you to repay your mortgage in cheaper dollars _ offset to some degree these days by variable interest rates _ it also allows Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> to repay his debts with money that is n't worth as much as it seems. Says <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>: `` With $ 1.83 trillion of privately held outstanding federal debt securities and a 4.2 percent inflation rate in fiscal 1988, the decline in the real value of outstanding debt offset roughly half the officially reported deficit.'' There may be a danger _ most economists today might say a very real one _ in playing down budget-deficit dangers, especially in view of the tendency of Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> to seek excuses for spending beyond his means. But at the other extreme, there may be pitfalls too in failing to understand where those big numbers come from, especially by those folks who tend to look at government budgets as similar to their own.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Announces Plan to Lay Off 2,000, Reorganize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to lay off about 2,000 workers worldwide was based on slow demand and dipping prices but will allow the company to recover its financial health by summer, company officials and analysts said The layoffs are part of a company reorganization announced Monday in a move allowing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> to focus on its primary business _ advanced semiconductors. The company, which designs, manufactures and markets advanced semiconductor products, currently employs about 39,000 people worldwide. `` While we expect slow growth this calendar year, in line with industry levels, our management remains optimistic about the long-term outlook for our company,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe this action will allow us to focus on our core business and to maintain the company's growth and long-term health,'' said <PERSON> Sporck </PERSON>. National Semiconductor's action follows the layoff of nearly 2,500 employees by <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION>, 1,000 of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AMD </ORGANIZATION> blamed a soft market, while analysts said poor management also contributed significantly to the company's financial problems. A weakening demand for semiconductors and, by extension, personal computers in the second half of 1988 affected most major Silicon Valley manufacturers. But shrewd management practices helped most companies _ from <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> _ avoid layoffs. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry's monthly ratio of orders to shipments slipped to its lowest point of the year in December, according to figures released last Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The figure meant that for every $ 100 in products shipped, there were $ 93 in new orders. The figure for new orders reached a high of $ 1.18 in April, and has fallen every month except one since then. <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION>, a high-technology consulting firm, has predicted the semiconductor industry will experience modest growth of about 10 percent for the rest of this year, down from 36 percent last year. National Semiconductor's layoffs will occur at all levels in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with about 50 percent of the cuts being made domestically, said company spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coady </PERSON>. The company also will take a one-time restructuring charge in the third quarter of its current fiscal year. Company officials could n't immediately say what that charge will be, although the information should be available within a few days, <PERSON> Coady </PERSON> said. For the first half of fiscal 1989, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 55.7 million. In the latest quarter, the company posted a net loss of $ 25 million on revenue of $ 705 million. Company officials said the layoffs will allow <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> to achieve two goals: a corporate reorganization and bringing costs and staffing into line with declining revenues in the semiconductor industry. `` Companies are n't buying as many personal computers,'' said <PERSON> Coady </PERSON>. `` Luckily we are a broad-based supplier.'' The drop in revenues also was caused by an inventory adjustment by distributors who bought very heavily in the summer and had built up huge supplies, analysts said. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Quist in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, predicted the company is `` getting healthy again'' and will break even this quarter and begin to turn a profit by the end of fiscal year 1990, if it can work through the `` price dropping issue.'' `` They now have a fix on where they are going with sales and know what the level of business will be and what work force will be needed for that,'' <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said. The layoffs will likely be permanent unless there is a surprise large upswing in the market, <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Steel Industry Capacity to Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's ability to produce steel will increase this year after declining for seven consecutive years, according to the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The industry's raw steel production capability is expected to reach 115.9 million tons this year, up from 112 million tons in 1988, the low point of the decade. The figure was projected from a December survey of all mills with furnaces for melting, the institute said Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steelmakers had facilities capable of producing 160 million tons of steel per year in 1977, the highest on record. The projected increase from 1988 to 1989 is mostly a result of newer and more efficient equipment. Those capital investments have paid off with increased yield of finished products per ton of raw steel, the institute said. The average yield is now close to 85 percent, compared with 71.5 percent 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was lower against most major foreign currencies in moderate European trading today. Gold prices rose. Traders in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said they expected the dollar to fluctuate within a tight range ahead of Wednesday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for November. The figures are expected to show a slight widening of the trade gap from October's $ 10.35 billion. They also suggested the market was determined to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some breathing space in his first few months in office. `` The market can hardly be displeased with the election of the second straight conservative president, especially one who should be less of a big spender than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said one trader with an Italian commercial bank in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Traders in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar was also being held in check by expectations that central banks will attempt a renewed assault on the currency if it rises. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 127.70. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.65 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8474 West German marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5750 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3010 French francs, down from 6.3285; 2.0828 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.25 Italian lire, down from 1,359.50; and 1.1965 Canadian dollars, unchanged In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.7695 today, more expensive for buyers than 1.7615 Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 402.40 a troy ounce, up from $ 401.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 402.10. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 401.50, up from $ 401.35 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.78 to close at a bid $ 404.43. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 5.91 a troy ounce, up from Monday's $ 5.89.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained sharply against the Japanese yen today, reflecting its sharp rise on overseas markets overnight, and stock prices fell in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar opened at 127.93 yen and went as high as 128.15 yen in early trading before easing back to 127.70 yen at the finish, up 1.05 yen from the close of 126.65 yen last Friday, when the dollar gained 0.53 yen. The market was closed Monday for a national holiday. Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> attributed the dollar's strength to the difference in key interest rates between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to reported statements by West German finance authorities that the dollar's current level is acceptable. He ruled out the possibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervening to stem the dollar's rise, saying, `` The situation does not require immediate countermeasures.'' Traders noted that on Monday, the dollar closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 128.05 yen and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 128.10. One reason for the gains, they said, was reduced chances of central bank intervention as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> observed a holiday and many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> traders were absent from the market in observance of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s birthday. `` There had been strong demand for buying the dollar, but traders' fears over intervention prevented such a move,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Then when they were freed from such fears, they all went out to buy the dollar.'' But the traders added that the dollar was unlikely to continue gaining while the market awaited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reports due Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues dipped 70.86 points, or 0.23 percent, closing at 31,227.52. Dealers said the dollar's steep gain and anxiety over the upcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reports contributed to the decline as many investors pulled back to the sidelines. Prices of export-oriented issues fell, as did those of steel, railway and petroleum shares. `` It appeared the market was taking a break today as the market anxiously awaits the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reports,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage. `` But the yen's sharp downslide against the dollar gave a downward direction and most shares ended up lower.'' But most dealers appeared to take today's decline as temporary. `` The market is still bullish despite today's slip,'' said <PERSON> Ichitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think it still has potential for further growth.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest automaker, on Tuesday reported record highs for production and sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year, while No. 2 automaker <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said overall production fell slightly and exports dropped by more than 11 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> said its 1988 production totaled a record 4.24 million vehicles, up from the previous record of some 4 million in 1986. Overseas production, which rose 27 percent to 244,210 autos last year, will increase 82 percent to 450,000 this year, due to increased output in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 exports were 1.82 million vehicles, up 2.5 percent, including 1.23 million passenger cars, up 3.3 percent. But exports are expected to fall 2 percent this year to 1.78 million. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s best year for exports was 1985, with 1.98 million vehicles Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year are expected to stay at their 1988 level of 859,000 because of last week's announcement that Japanese automakers will continue to limit exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in efforts to reduce trade friction. Toyota production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled 74,072 vehicles in 1988 and is expected to be 170,000 to 200,000 cars this year. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic sales in 1988 hit a record high of 2.12 million vehicles, giving it 31.5 percent of the domestic market, based on vehicle registrations. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> had a 17.3 percent share while <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> had 9.3 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 9.1 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 6 percent, registration statistics showed. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> reported total 1988 vehicle production of 2.71 million, down 0.1 percent from 1987. Its domestic sales and overseas production grew, however, with domestic sales rising 13.5 percent to 1.16 million. Overseas production was 549,016, up 11.9 percent, and is expected to grow to a record high of 632,000 in 1989, up 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell 6.5 percent to 206,000 autos in 1988, but is expected to grow 18.4 percent to 244,000 this year. But overall exports fell 11.2 percent to 1.04 million, while exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plunged 36.5 percent to 348,000. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> did not reveal a target for exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, but said they were certain to rise with the introduction of several new models to the American market this year. Overall exports are expected to grow by 3 percent this year, reaching 1.08 million vehicles. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> produced 1.22 million cars, up 1.8 percent, the firm also reported Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> sold 408,000 cars in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, up 13 percent, and exported 820,000, down 0.6 percent. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> expects to produce 1.22 million again, and increase domestic sales 10.3 percent to 450,000 while exports are expected to drop a further 1.2 percent to 810,000. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> said last week it would sell more than 900,000 cars in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this year, including more than 800,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It will produce 360,000 cars at its facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from 366,000 in 1988, but increase production in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> from 50,000 to 80,000.

RJR charged that a political faction of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> has printed information in the Jan. 6 issue about Premier, which heats rather than burns tobacco. The company said the information is scientifically incorrect. `` No scientific journal, no matter how widely read or well regarded, can afford to dilute or distort scientific facts, much less publish information that they ought to know is scientifically incorrect,'' Di <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Housefly Habits In Famous Restaurant Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New 4th graf ``Today, prosecutors...'' to update with one charge
dropped.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dinner for two costs at least $ 250 at <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gavroche </ORGANIZATION>, so what is the master chef doing in court, being bugged about flies messing up the food in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s most famous restaurant? The prosecution trotted out a 10-inch model of a fly to display in magistrates' court on Monday, where chef <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roux </PERSON> was contesting 15 charges of violating food and hygiene regulations and five under health and safety legislation. The charges, for which the eatery could face fines, refer to food contamination by flies and the premises being at risk of infestation by rats and mice. Today, prosecutors dropped one charge filed under the food and hygiene regulations, saying it had been determined there was no problem with the location of the restaurant staff's bathroom. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavroche </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s chichi <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION> area, is one of just two restaurants in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to hold the coveted <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> three-star rating. The other, at <LOCATION> Bray-on-Thames </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, is run by <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>. A health officer for Westminster city council has testified that he saw flies in the restaurant kitchen, attracted by dirty, open garbage bins outside, flying in through open windows and doors and holes in the pantry's mesh screen. Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, an entomologist and witness for the prosecution, brought in the model of the fly. He testified that the insect has `` revolting'' eating habits and can cause a list of diseases running to 45 pages. <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said these include salmonella, dysentery and conjunctivitis and said flies contaminate food while they eat, mate and lay eggs on it. There was laughter in court when <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> added that in the Jewish religion, `` one can kill flies on the Sabbath and a fly in one's food is grounds for divorce. But <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said in answering <PERSON> Roux </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON>: `` I do n't think any entomologist could find direct evidence of any particular disease caused by a fly.'' <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> said council health officer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker-Brown </PERSON> was `` obviously biased'' and `` eager to prosecute ... One can not rely too heavily on the objectivity, fairness and judgement of a man who described a chipped -LRB- electric -RRB- plug as ` serious.''' <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Parker-Brown </PERSON>'s predecessor had praised the <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavroche </PERSON> kitchen and put it in the top category. The kitchen's alleged deterioration coincided with the arrival of Parker-Brown, he said <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavroche </PERSON>, said the attorney, is a `` restaurant of which this country can feel proud.'' <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON> said it was inconceivable that in 18 months it could have gone from being a shining example to squalor and a possible candidate for closure, and then back to best again, `` all under the same management.'' Health officers have said they did not find <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavroche </PERSON> filthy enough to close, but the bad publicity over the case has been a major punishment in itself.

 Engineers found errors in emergency system wiring of two <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s, an airline spokesman said today. Similar problems have been reported in five other planes belonging to four carriers. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the airline immediately notified the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and corrected the problems, which would have prevented sprinklers from working properly in the event of a baggage hold fire. Similar problems were earlier reported in another Delta-operated 757, one belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, two owned by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> and one operated by the British airline Air 2000. One of the Air Holland planes was being used by a charter company in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Discovery of the crossed-wiring by <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> engineers in one of its 41 new 757s led to an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` airworthiness directive'' last Friday. Airlines using the planes had until this morning to complete the inspections. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 25 of the 757s, and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which has 33, said today they found no problems with any of their planes. <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said all other <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> planes also passed the inspection. He said one plane had cross-wiring into the cargo area, which would have resulted in the wrong sprinkler system going off. The other had a wiring error that would have flashed a warning light in the cockpit, but the fire extinguisher would not have worked, he said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the agency had not yet received complete results of the testing of either the 757s or of testing under an earlier order involving engine fire warnings systems of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. In checks with several of the 10 airlines involved with the 737 inspections during the weekend, none reported a problem. Regular airline service was not affected by any of the inspections, officials said. The directive for 737s came as the result of speculation that cross-wiring might have misled the pilot of a British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> 737 to shut down his good right engine after the left one caught fire. Officials have yet to determine cause of the crash that killed 44 people Jan. 8. The two <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directives were not related, except that both involved possible cross-wiring. The 757 inspection was for cross-wiring of warning systems from the cargo holds, done either on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> assembly line in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the planes were built less than a year ago or during maintenance. `` We are looking into the technical aspects of it to see what the miswiring was or is, how they relate to each other, and what might have happened so we can correct it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Monday after problems with five aircraft had been reported. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said three of the first five planes affected were manufactured at the same time, but the one owned <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunei </ORGANIZATION> and the first one from <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> were not. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will examine what happened and study the way the -LRB- fire extinguisher -RRB- bottles are put in there. We'll see if something can be done to make them less fallible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kraft To Sell Food Distributor, Layoff Workers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts lead to move up reference to layoffs.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans to cut about 250 workers from its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area operations over the next two months, and to sell its small Kraft-Sage food operation to a management group, company officials say. The layoffs, which will affect three <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> facilities, are the result of the company's recent merger with <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s ongoing productivity improvement program, the company announced Monday <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said employees will be laid off from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, its manufacturing research and development unit in <LOCATION> Northbrook </LOCATION> and the company's food-service operation in <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>. He said the layoffs will reduce the company's work force, some 2,800 in the area, by slightly less than 8 percent. The move had been expected since October, when <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> took over <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> in a $ 12.9 billion deal, he said. `` <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> just formalized it,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` You're seeing the kind of home office cuts you always see in mergers; you only need so many accountants and tax guys,'' one <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> source told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` But operations are n't much affected at all.'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> also announced Monday its intent to sell its Kraft-Sage operation to the <ORGANIZATION> Stillman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Greenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The management of Kraft-Sage, chief executive officer <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stillman </PERSON> and president <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, formed the acquisition companies so they could buy the company. Kraft-Sage, located in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is a specialty distributor and marketer of foodservice products to the airline industry.

 A <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> man who lost a leg in a farm accident lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bid today to revive his lawsuit against a farm equipment manufacturer. The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the lawsuit was dismissed improperly because a stenographer was tardy in transcribing pretrial statements. The accident occurred Oct. 22, 1983, when <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> was unloading corn from a wagon into an old house used for grain storage. His clothing was caught in the portable conveyor connecting a tractor to the corn elevator, and his left leg had to be severed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, threw out the suit against <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloomington </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the conveyor manufacturer. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said the conveyor's design was defective and was inherently dangerous. <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>'s own negligence _ his failure to stand far enough away from the machine _ caused the accident. The company also said the machine had been modified since its manufacture and that <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> ws not responsible for the changes. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> threw out the suit on June 30, 1987 without reviewing depositions _ or pretrial statements _ from witnesses for <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>. An engineer said in the deposition that the conveyor was defective because it lacked a guard to prevent such accidents. The engineer also said any changes in the machinery were minor and had little bearing on the accident. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last June that it was <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>'s responsibility to make sure that a transcript of the statement was provided to the judge. `` Without the deposition testimony, -LRB- <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> -RRB- has presented no evidence of design defect,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>'s lawyers said the stenographer, called a court reporter, violated federal court rules by failing to supply the judge with the statement. The lawyers said, unbeknownst to them, the stenographer sent a transcript of the deposition to attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> but not to <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> was `` denied his day in court beacuse of the failure of a court reporter to follow the federal rules,'' attorneys said. They also said that federal appeals courts elsewhere in the nation have reinstated suits in such cases. The case is <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, 88-758.

 Corn futures opened sharply lower but wheat prices advanced and soybeans were mostly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the previous session's sharp losses Analysts said the wheat and soybean markets were turning higher on indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would need to increase its grain imports. Among those signals is the Soviets' own estimate that domestic grain production will fall 40 million tons short of the target of 235 million tons. `` The background stories that they might be coming in for a lot more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products have certainly supported the market,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>KN Energy Expects Profit Despite $40 Million Writedown Of Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plans take a writedown of $ 40.1 million in the fourth quarter, but expects its 1988 earnings to exceed its 1987 net income of $ 13.3 million. The company is marking down the value of its coal, oil and natural gas resources to reflect current market prices, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Battey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said Monday. Despite the $ 40.1 million writedown in the fourth quarter in 1988, gains from a lawsuit settlement and an asset sale should enable <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the year to surpass those of 1987, <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> said. Financial results for 1988 will be announced next month. The bulk of the pretax writedown _ $ 33 million _ reflects a lower valuation for <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION>'s coal properties, according to <PERSON> Battey </PERSON>. The valuation of oil and gas assets was reduced by $ 7.1 million. In early January, <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 36.1 million gain from the settlement of a lawsuit involving the <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slurry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> was a partner in the 1,000-mile proposed pipeline project, which never got off the ground mainly because of railroads' opposition Settlements of lawsuits against those railroads have brought millions of dollars to <ORGANIZATION> ETSI </ORGANIZATION> partners. And last June, <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> sold its east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> pipeline subsidiaries for a pretax gain of $ 15.7 million. <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> said the company plans to increase production later this year at its Golden Eagle underground coal mine west of <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. The mine is operated by <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. `` Our <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> coal subsidiary has a good operating base in its contract for coal sales to the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Battey </PERSON> said. `` After the addition of efficient long-wall mining equipment, which <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Fuel will lease and have in operation later this year, we expect to have positive cash flow and operating income.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's raised <ORGANIZATION> KN </ORGANIZATION>'s senior debt and preferred stock rating by one level to A-minus from BBB. The New York-based credit-rating agency said the improved rating was due to the improved coal outlook, the use of pipeline litigation income to reduce debt and to new markets.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce two aircraft orders for 160 airplanes worth $ 7.4 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported today. American spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> described the report as `` highly speculative.'' According to the article, the airline, owner of the largest commercial jet fleet in the non-communist world, will order 60 long-range <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-11s for an estimated $ 5.4 billion and 100 domestic-range MD-80s for an estimated $ 2 billion more.

The two deals will be announced within the next three weeks, as soon as final language of the contract is worked out, the article said. Asked to comment on the report, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said: `` We have not signed any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of the aircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent. `` The article is highly speculative,'' he said when reached by the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at American's headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> did note, however, that American has been evaluating both the MD-11 and the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 as part of its preparation for expansion in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and European air markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> said the deal would have to be approved by the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s parent company.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices closed lower Tuesday as players took profits on the market's strong rally in recent weeks. Trading volume also was lower amid caution ahead of a string of economic statistics due out later this week. Key among these is Wednesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for November. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished 4.1 points, or 0.2 percent, lower at 1,867.7. Volume fell to 424.2 million shares from Monday's 497 million shares. Since the start of the year, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market has declined in just three of its 11 trading sessions, and dealers said it was due for some selling. Aside from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report, players also are awaiting news on British employment and average earnings, due Thursday, and British inflation figures, scheduled for release on Friday. While Monday's news of a slowing in British retail sales in December was welcomed, the market is hoping the additional reports will confirm that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s interest rate hikes are beginning to ease inflationary pressures on the economy.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` Rambo-style diplomacy'' led to frequent trade clashes with European countries but trans-Atlantic relations remain good, according to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s former top trade official <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, who recently finished four years as a key official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, also raised the possibility that the latest trade dispute _ sparked by a European ban on hormone-treated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meat _ might be resolved shortly through negotiations. `` I think there is a way to get out of it,'' he said in a recent interview. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said he considered conflicts and divergent interests to be normal between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation Common Market trading bloc. `` What I have always deplored is the frequency which ... increased so visibly and intensively during the 1985 to 1989 period and the way the American administration was behaving,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials reacted to conflicts with the Common Market by `` putting deadlines -LRB- and -RRB- threatening with measures _ the famous Rambo-style diplomacy which we do not like very much here in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>.'' Even so, he said, `` the atmosphere has always been good'' between the giant trading partners. `` Although there have been many, many problems, we have had almost no real shooting war,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> for four years was the top trade and foreign affairs official of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the Common Market's executive body. He now is a candidate of a conservative Belgian political party for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the trading group's legislative body. The latest trans-Atlantic trade spat was touched off by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s Jan. 1 prohibition on imports of American meat from cattle treated with growth hormones The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retaliated by imposing, also on Jan. 1, higher tariffs on a variety of European products. Common Market officials tentatively have agreed on counter-measures that would slap stiff duties on American imports of dried fruit and walnuts. Foreign ministers of the member nations are to meet next Monday to consider formally backing those measures. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said the community and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to allow sanctioned products to enter their borders through the end of January. This would apply to goods in transit before Jan. 1. He noted the delay probably will allow the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to start a new dialogue on the issue with the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` There has to be another round of negotiations,'' he said. But <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> said it was `` impossible'' for the Common Market to lift the ban on hormone-treated meat, as demanded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. European officials cited health concerns in imposing the meat ban, which originally was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988. The trading bloc agreed to a one-year delay but refused further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appeals for a postponement. `` If you say it is to protect our population, then you have to maintain it if it is so,'' he said. `` Expecting the -LRB- community -RRB- to say now that it is going to allow the production or entry of meat with hormones ... is an illusion.'' The prohibition is expected to halt the importation of about $ 100 million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, some of which are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet food is exempted. American officials contend the use of certain hormones to fatten cattle, a common practice among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers, does not pose a health risk. The meat imports represent a tiny fraction of the estimated $ 166 billion in trade last year between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Common Market. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON> also said relations between the Common Market and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had grown in recent years. He said European exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> likely soared by 20 percent to 25 percent last year from $ 15.4 billion in 1987. `` We have pushed the Japanese government ... into opening the markets more -LRB- and -RRB- integrating <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> more into the international and economic circuit, behaving in other words like a great economic and trading power should,'' he said. Common Market members are <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.

 Pushing the dollar lower against the Japanese yen to help shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit could have the opposite effect in the long term as Japanese businesses become more competitive, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Makoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses were fully competitive at current exchange rates even though they had problems competing in foreign arenas `` A further decline in the dollar would not reduce the Japanese trade surplus,'' <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` If the dollar weakens further, Japanese businesses would take steps to survive by further rationalization of business and manufacturing, keeping wage increases low, cutting labor further _ economy in every aspect,'' <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> said. `` After this process of rationalization, Japanese manufacturers might be still more competitive,'' and paying lower prices in dollar terms for imported raw materials would give them a further advantage, he said. Japanese manufacturers responded to the first major appreciation of the yen against the dollar in 1985-1986 by improving efficiency after the major industrialized nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, agreed to slash the dollar's value to help shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. In February 1987, those nations agreed on approximate exchange rate ranges for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and other major currencies, seeking to restore stability to exchange markets, but the dollar continued to slide from its September 1985 level of 240 yen. The dollar closed at 127.70 yen Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It has ranged between 120 yen and 135 yen since November 1987. Economists remain divided over the actual impact of a cheaper dollar on trade flows. Some say the cheaper dollar has helped narrow the trade gap by dampening demand for more expensive foreign goods in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and stimulating sales of cheaper American goods overseas. They also say the dollar would have to drop to 80 yen or lower to achieve desired reductions in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. But <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> said further declines in the dollar's value would not improve American export competitiveness. `` The problem is not price competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries, but the willingness and capacity to export,'' <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> said. Using exchange rates to boost exports has the disadvantage of encouraging manufacturers to concentrate on fattening their profit margins rather than improving productivity, <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> stated. The senior ministry official urged the incoming administration of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cut the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal budget deficit and curb consumer demand. `` Then <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers would become more eager to seek out overseas markets to sell their products,'' he said. <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> said little remains to be done by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s government to open its markets to foreign exporters. Instead, the question is `` how to crack the ice of the private sector,'' he said. He predicted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus would decline by several billion dollars in fiscal 1988, which ends March 31, and by another several billion dollars in fiscal 1989. In 1987, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus in the current account, which measures trade in goods and services, flows of short-term interest and dividends, repatriation of profits and other financial transfers, was $ 86.7 billion, up from $ 85.8 billion in 1986. Its surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hit a record $ 59.8 billion in 1987, up from $ 58.6 billion in 1986. In 1986, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus amounted to 3.6 percent of its gross national product, and was expected to amount to a little over 2 percent this year, <PERSON> Utsumi </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The mid-flight disintegration of part of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is likely to lead to as many as 50 orders to strengthen older passenger jets in the next year, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive says. In the meantime, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, vice president for engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the world's largest commercial jet manufacturer is making sure the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is told of problems in older planes. At a news briefing on aging aircraft, <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said that when <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials hear about an aircraft problem from an airline, they tell the carrier to notify the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> within 24 hours, `` and we make sure that it does.'' The <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> accident last April stunned the commercial aircraft industry and raised questions about older aircraft and how long they can safely fly. The <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 was flying over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> when an 18-foot section ripped from the top of the jetliner. A flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 of the 93 other people aboard were hurt before the crew managed to land the plane on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. The 19-year-old plane, with nearly 90,000 flights, was the second most-heavily used plane in the worldwide 737 fleet. Last June, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sponsored a three-day conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on older planes. One result was the creation of task forces of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer and airline representatives to examine ways to ensure older planes' safety. Since the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has changed some of its thinking about older aircraft, sometimes requiring operators to make specific modifications rather than just checking for a given problem and correcting it if trouble is found. Last fall, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> required operators of many older 737s to replace thousands of rivets in some places where a 737's skin is joined after the adhesive used on those lap joints was found prone to delamination. In December, a similar order was issued for older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 tri-jets. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, who serves on a working group that oversees task forces dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes, said it has reviewed service bulletins <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has issued over the years as advisories for 727, 737 and 747 jumbo jets operators and has nearly completed recomending which ones airlines now should be required to perform. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> will then determine which modifications should be made mandatory through `` airworthiness directives,'' or orders to air carriers, he said. `` You're going to see ads coming out pretty quick on some recommendations,'' he said, adding later that as many as `` 50, 51'' directives could be issued in the next 12 months. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes, other work groups are examining aircraft made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, Convair, <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> and British Aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said the number of directives involving older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airframes could be as few as 10 or 12, and that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> may group some smaller modifications into single directives to make the process simpler. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials and many others in the industry say commercial planes can be flown indefinitely, as long as they are properly maintained. What determines an airplane's life, they say, is the increasing cost of maintenance, the aircraft's efficiency, and technological changes. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report on causes of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident is expected out shortly, and <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said he would wait until it is released before commenting on why that massive structural failure occurred.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in choppy European trading Tuesday as activity ebbed in advance of Wednesday's release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for November. Gold prices rose. Dealers said investors were selling dollars to take profits before the trade figures are released. Economists expected the November deficit to have widened to $ 11.1 billion from $ 10.35 billion in October. The market also believed the dollar was too high after its big jump Monday, dealers said. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency began to recover in late trading after it began to rally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> obviously still likes the buck,'' said a chief dealer at a British bank, noting that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> players have been more bullish than their European counterparts recently. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7680 to buy one pound, dearer than $ 1.7615 Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.8505 West German marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5755 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3085 French francs, down from 6.3285; 2.0855 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.00 Italian lire, down from 1,359.50; and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 127.70 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.75 yen. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 402.25 a troy ounce, compared with $ 401.75 bid late Monday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 402.15, compared with $ 401.35 bid late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.78 to close at a bid $ 404.43. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.92 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's $ 5.89.

<HEAD>L.F. Rothschild Quits As Primary Dealer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Tuesday said it voluntarily decided to quit as a primary dealer in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities and to discontinue most trading of the securities because the activities have not been profitable enough The company said in a statement `` the return on capital devoted to its government securities operations was insufficient to warrant continuation of the business.'' <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> said it had ample capital to satisfy new guidelines announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> last November and the decision was made purely on profitability grounds. The guidelines announced by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Fed Nov. 17 doubled the minimum capital required for securities companies who have the coveted title of primary dealer. The minimum was raised to more than $ 50 million. Primary dealers can buy and sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities directly from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. Through the buying and selling of the securities, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> seeks to influence interest rates. Therefore, financial firms with primary dealer status have an insight into government interest rate policy. Also, primary dealership is sought-after because some big institutional investors prefer to conduct their business exclusively through primary dealers. The <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> move, which will result in the loss of about 50 employees' jobs, curtails all of the company's sales and trading activities of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities except for proprietary trading, meaning for its own account. The company had been acting as a primary dealer for about two years. From now on, <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION>'s operations will consist of fixed-income securities sales and trading as a dealer in mortgage-backed securites, as well as corporate and high-yield securities. It will also continue to operate in the investment banking field. The withdrawal of <PERSON> L.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, reduces the number of primary dealers to 44. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced its departure from the exclusive group. County NatWest, a subsidiary of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest bank, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, had been under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to boost its capital.

 Corn and soybean futures posted a second day of sharp losses Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, partly in a continuing reaction to the government's report of larger-than-expected corn supplies, analysts said. Wheat and oat futures closed mostly higher. Rumors that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may cancel some soybean or soybean-meal purchases because of port congestion also contributed to the decline in soybean futures prices, as did improved growing conditions for the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop, analysts said. Intra-day losses in the corn market approached the exchange's 15-cents-a-bushel limit, which was expanded from 10 cents a bushel following limit declines on Monday But a late rally brought corn and soybean futures off their lows of the day. Monday's plunge was linked to Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report, which indicated supplies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybeans were larger than most market experts had expected. `` The market is searching for support now following the liquidation as a result of crop report,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s said Tuesday its first-quarter profit fell 17 percent from the same period last year, when profits were boosted by a tax adjustment related to production of the B-1B bomber. The aerospace, electronics and industrial company said it earned $ 160 million, or 62 cents a share, in its first quarter of fiscal 1989, down from $ 192.9 million, or 71 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales for the quarter ended December 31 were $ 2.87 billion, up from $ 2.68 billion a year earlier. The first-quarter profit fell in comparison with the 1988 quarter because the company recorded a one-time gain of $ 50.2 million from tax benefits related to the B-1B programin the earlier period. The benefit came from deferring taxes on some income in previous years of the B-1B program until last year, when the tax rate was lower. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> delivered the last B-1B to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in April, and the end of that program meant decreased sales in the aerospace division, which also works on the space shuttle. Sales rose in the electronics, automotive and graphics divisions.

 Lawyers for shareholders and creditors of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday dismissed a $ 2 billion offer for the company by <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> as too low. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s 100,000 shareholders, said they would urge the company's board to reject <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>' plan `` as totally unsatisfactory.'' `` The offer does n't contain anything for shareholders, and we believe it's inadequate,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> offered last week to buy <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s assets aside from its share of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant for $ 1.2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s 36 percent stake in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> would be spun off to the company's unsecured creditors, while a <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary would buy <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> power for $ 750 million. Northeast Utilities, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest power company, also would pay <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors $ 300 million in cash, stock and financial backing, bringing the total cost of the transaction to $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> was forced into reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws last year because of rising debts from the $ 5.8 billion <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant, which remains idle in the absence of a federal operating permit. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said bidding for <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> should begin at $ 2.8 billion and any buyout plan must include <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, who represents thousands of <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> junk bond holders and creditors with claims of about $ 1 billion, said the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> offer `` casts too much of the contingent risk as to whether <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will operate on creditors.'' The state, which has been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> on a reorganization plan for the utility, said Tuesday it was too early to take a position on the offer from Connecticut-based <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>. Senior Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smukler </PERSON> said, however, the offer `` represents a reasonable basis for -LRB- further -RRB- discussion'' to resolve <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization. <PERSON> Smukler </PERSON> noted that the eletric rates <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> is proposing `` are higher than rates the state currently has on the table.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> plan calls for annual rate increases of 4.5 percent this year and next followed by five years in which rates would increase at approximately the inflation rate. The state's proposal calls for five consecutive 4 percent rate increases, while <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is seeking a total rate increase of 30 percent to 40 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar slipped Tuesday in quiet trading, reflecting money-dealer reluctance to take risky positions in the currency prior to the release of the potentially market-moving monthly trade deficit report. Gold prices rose slightly after declining in the previous trading session. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 402.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 401.80 at the same time Monday. Currency strategists said the dollar's decline signaled a cautious approach by dollar holders toward the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Wednesday release of the November <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit statistics The consensus is for a shortfall of about $ 11 billion, compared with $ 10.35 billion the month before, but the numbers are renowned for defying predictions. A number sharply higher than $ 11 billion could possibly incite a big selloff in dollars, while a much smaller number could encourage a surge in demand for the currency. In either case, the uncertainty of whether central banks would intervene to stabilize the dollar's value with massive purchases or sales of their own also encouraged caution in the market, currency traders said. `` It was a very quiet day, with people squaring their positions ahead of the release of the number,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>, senior foreign exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Over the past few years the trade deficit numbers have become a powerful influence over the foreign-exchange market, because of their role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic policy as well as their unpredictability from month to month. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to 127.70 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it was quoted at 127.75 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 127.83 yen, down from 128.10 yen late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the British pound strengthened to $ 1.7680 vs. $ 1.7615 Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fetched $ 1.7707, more expensive than its $ 1.7610 exchange value late Monday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with rates late Monday: 1.8495 West German marks, down from 1.8565; 1.5746 Swiss francs, down from 1.5845; 1.1982 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1979; 6.3065 French francs, down from 6.3245; and 1,355.375 Italian lire, down from 1,359.50. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late rates Monday: 1.8505 marks, down from 1.8575; 1.5755 Swiss francs, down from 1.5835; 6.3085 French francs, down from 6.3285; 2.0855 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0965; 1,354.00 Italian lire, down from 1,359.50; and 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965.

Earnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company, and three other big banking concerns reported sharply higher earnings Tuesday for both the fourth-quarter of 1988 and the whole year. Most of the banks, which included <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said they were helped partly by tighter cost controls and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s resumption of interest payments on foreign loans. The earnings of all four banks were severely hurt in 1987 _ the peak of the Third World debt crisis _ when <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> halted interest payments on bank loans and other economically troubled countries negotiated to restructure their debt. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> said earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $ 747 million, or $ 2.19 a share, compared with $ 621 million, or $ 1.82 a share, in the comparable 1987 quarter. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings totaled $ 1.85 billion, or $ 5.36 a share. That compared with a loss of $ 1.18 billion in 1987, when the company decided to increase its provision to cover possible losses from shaky Third World debt. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth largest banking company, earned $ 258.1 million in the fourth quarter, or $ 1.38 a share, compared with the $ 224.1 million, or $ 1.21 a share, earned in 1987 fourth quarter. The company's 1988 earnings totaled $ 1.00 billion, or $ 5.38 a share, compared with $ 83.3 million, or 39 cents a share, in the previous year. Security Pacific, ranked sixth, said quarterly earnings totaled $ 169.5 million, or $ 1.46 a share, vs. a loss of $ 39.4 million the previous year. Its annual earnings reached $ 638.9 million, or $ 5.59 a share, vs. $ 15.7 million, or a penny a share, in 1987. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, ranked 10th, said fourth quarter earnings were $ 136 million, or $ 2.45 a share, up 22 percent from $ 111.2 million, or $ 1.96 a share, in 1987. For the year, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings totaled $ 512.5 million, or $ 9.20, vs. $ 50.8 million, or 52 cents, in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> said all sectors of the company did well partly due to tighter expense controls. The company said quarterly and annual earnings included, among other things, $ 436 million from nearly two years of accumulated Brazilian interest payments and $ 160 million from tax benefits stemming from its $ 3 billion addition in loan-loss reserves in May 1987. <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> said it received $ 240 million of past-due interest from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> during the final quarter of 1988. On top of that, its loan-loss provision shrank, to $ 200 million for all of 1988 from $ 960 million in 1987. Security Pacific said the recognition of Brazilian interest payments accounted for $ 58 million of the increase in net interest income. It said results also reflected slow growth in non-interest expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said losses on loans to developing companies totaled $ 663.6 million in 1988 as a result of loan sales and other measures that reduced its debt exposure. At year's end, the company had reduced non-trade related developing country debt to $ 520 million, down from $ 950 million as of Sept. 30, 1988, and $ 1.8 billion at the end of 1987. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> said the provision for its loan losses in the fourth quarter was $ 75 million, down from $ 114 million a year ago. The full-year provision was $ 300 million, compared with $ 892 million in 1987.

 Stock prices fell for a second day Tuesday as nervousness over trade deficit figures due Wednesday contributed to the market's first back-to-back declines of 1989.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Plunge Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn futures prices plunged Tuesday for the second straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid rumors of export cancellations in a market already weakened by the government's report of larger-than-expected supplies. Soybean futures also fell sharply while wheat and oat futures finished mostly higher. On other other markets, gasoline futures led energy futures higher; precious metals advanced; livestock and meat futures were mostly higher; and stock-index futures retreated. Wheat settled 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.36 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 10 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.67 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.33 a bushel; and soybeans were 14 -LCB- cents lower to 1 cent higher with March at $ 7.70 -RCB- a bushel. Rumors that port congestion may force the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to cancel some of its purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, soybeans or soybean meal weighed on the futures markets for those commodities, analysts said. Under a long-term grain agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has so far agreed to purchase more than 10 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 1.1 million tons of soybean meal, 450,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans and 370,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for 1988-89 delivery. The cancellation rumors had the greatest impact in the corn pit, where intra-day losses approached the 15-cents-a-bushel limit. The Board of Trade expanded the daily trading limit for corn from 10 cents a bushel following limit declines on Monday. Analysts said the rumors surfaced just as the corn and soybean markets appeared to be recovering from Monday's collapse, which was linked to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report released Friday that indicated that supplies of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and soybeans were larger than most market experts had expected. `` When people started talking about net cancellations of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales by the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>, that brought in a pretty bearish attitude right up until the close,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Additional selling of soybean futures was prompted by reports of improved growing conditions in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, where a spate of hot, dry weather got the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean crop off to a bad start, analysts said. A late rally brought corn and soybean futures off their lows of the day. But corn for near-month delivery still closed at its lowest point since Dec. 20 and January soybeans finished at $ 7.61 -RCB-, the lowest soybean futures price since Dec. 5. `` The market is searching for support now following the liquidation as a result of the crop report,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Freed predicted corn prices would stabilize after Tuesday's sell-off `` The market will go to wherever the demand price is,'' he said. `` My feeling is that do n't have to go down too much farther in corn'' to attract buyers. Contracts for deferred deliveries of unleaded gasoline soared the 2-cents-a-gallon daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on speculation that new pollution-control standards taking effect this year in several Northeastern states will raise the price of gasoline production, analysts said. The new regulations in states including <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> create a more stringent standard for a characteristic of gasoline that is related to automobile exhaust emissions, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Crude oil for near-month delivery finished the day at a new 14-month high of $ 18.95 a barrel after trading as high as $ 19.21. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 30 cents higher with February at $ 18.95; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .13 cent higher with February at 53.05 cents a gallon; ands unleaded gasoline was .19 cent to 2 cents higher with February at 51.10 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures advanced on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar's weakness against major foreign currencies. Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with February at $ 404 a troy ounce; silver was 5.3 cents to 5.4 cents higher with March at $ 6.01 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent higher with February at 74.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with January at 85 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .22 cent higher with February at 44.92 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .23 cent higher with February at 42.25 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of stocks represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .60 point lower at 286.10. The contract is worth $ 500 a point.

 The dollar value of acquisitions in the computer software and services industry shot up 70 percent in 1988, according to a survey released Tuesday. Among the 434 deals done last year were a record 14 valued at more than $ 100 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banker that does a quarterly survey for Adapso, the computer software and services industry association. Overall, the transactions were valued at a record $ 8.4 billion, up from $ 4.9 billion in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> said. The number of deals rose 21 percent from 358 in 1987. The biggest deal was the $ 1.6 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> IMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> said. Many of the buyers were big companies that preferred to buy established companies rather than try to build software and services businesses from scratch. For private companies, being acquired can enrich the original owners while giving their company the resources to continue its growth. The alternative of making a public stock offering is unattractive in the current market, <ORGANIZATION> Broadview </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Federal charges were announced Tuesday against 18 former employees of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, alleging they defrauded more than 2,600 investors of some $ 40 million. The charges stem from an ongoing investigation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> _ the largest single investigation of its kind ever undertaken by federal officials, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said at a news conference. The former employees, named in a federal grand jury indictment and criminal information, are accused of using high-pressure sales tactics to persuade customers from around the country to invest in high-stakes commodity ventures misrepresented as being low-risk. More than $ 22 million of the investments was lost, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. Those named Tuesday include the failed company's former national vice president for sales, two branch managers, and 15 former salesmen and managers from its former offices in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. The criminal information includes charges by his office while the indictment includes charges by the grand jury. The defendants are charged with a total of 187 counts of wire fraud and mail fraud, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy. They include <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the former national sales vice president for the company; <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, 37, of suburban <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, former branch manager of the <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> office; and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, 38, of suburban <LOCATION> Flossmoor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, former house broker of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. Neither <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Barnards </ORGANIZATION> could be reached for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> Barnards </ORGANIZATION> have unpublished telephone numbers and <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> was not listed in the <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION> telephone listings. If convicted, those charged could face lengthy prison terms and thousands of dollars in fines. In the alleged scheme, customers were solicited by telephone by First Commodity sales representatives posing as phony commodities experts. Those representatives often made repeated phone calls using `` scripts'' handed out by managers, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. Investors were falsely told that `` commodity trading was not risky ... and would lead to high profits,'' he said. `` In fact ... the defendants knew almost all of -LRB- First Commodity's -RRB- customers lost money,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. During the alleged scheme, from 1980 to February 1987, $ 100 million in sales was brought in to the company's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> offices, and $ 63 million of that was lost, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. More than $ 40.6 million of those sales and more than $ 22.7 million of the losses were attributable to the former employees named in the complaints, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. He declined to say whether more charges were forthcoming, but noted that the investigation is continuing nationwide. Three other former <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> employees pleaded guilty to similar charges in December and have been cooperating in the probe, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` It is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them,'' he said. `` These cases should serve as a clear warning that fraud and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts _ in whatever form it takes _ will be thoroughly investigated and vigorously prosecuted.'' Founded in the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> rapidly grew into one of the nation's leading futures trading companies. But it collapsed in 1987 beneath a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal investigations.

<HEAD>Fannie Mae's Net Off in Fourth Quarter But Record High in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday reported a 22 percent drop in fourth-quarter income from the year before, but for all of 1988 profit rose to a record level. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, as the federally-chartered private corporation is commonly known, said after-tax income totaled $ 152.7 million, or $ 1.91 a share, in the final three months of 1988, down from $ 195 million, or $ 2.42 a share, in the corresponding 1987 quarter. Results for the entire year were better. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> had after-tax income of $ 506.7 million, up 34.8 percent from $ 376 million the prior year and a record annual amount. That translated to per-share earnings of $ 6.43 and $ 4.66 in the two respective periods. `` <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>'s record 1988 income successfully caps a year in which the company celebrated the 50th anniversary of its creation and its 20th year as a private company,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest investor in home mortgages. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> attributed last year's earnings growth to an increase in the spread between the yield on the corporation's investment portfolio and the cost of its debt outstanding, an increase in the company's average investment portfolio, continued expansion in fee income from mortgage-backed securities and a decline in the tax rate. Also beneficial was a decline in properties having to be taken over due to foreclosures. Such acquisitions have fallen in each of the past five quarters. The provision for losses on mortgage loans was reduced in the fourth quarter to $ 85 million from $ 120 million in 1987's final quarter. Part of the reason for the drop in the latest quarterly earnings was that the 1987 results included adjustments associated with changes undertaken following implementation of a new accounting standard. Without the changes, earnings in the fourth 1987 quarter would have been $ 60 million, or 75 cents a share and earnings for all of that year would have been $ 242 million, or $ 2.98 a share. As of Dec. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>'s assets totaled $ 112.1 billion, up 8.5 percent from $ 103.5 billion at the end of 1987.

A previous company estimate projected earnings for that quarter at 40 percent to 45 percent lower than the fourth quarter of 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> were ordered by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> into receivership Tuesday at the request of state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. The action was prompted by concerns over the <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON> companies' reserve capacity to cover primarily high-risk policies written in the 1960s and 1970s involving asbestos, medical malpractice and toxic waste claims, Singer said Under the order, which was supported by the companies, Singer was named receiver and the companies were enjoined from issuing new policies or proceeding with their business except as permitted by Singer. The companies were authorized to continue paying automobile, worker's compensation and certain disability and accident and health claims, but will not renew or write new policies. The companies, formed 101 years ago, are licensed in all 50 states but primarily operate in the Northeast. They have 20,000 commercial policies nationwide and nearly 75,000 personal policies. Singer said the order was intended to protect policyholders while the Insurance Division works with management `` in an effort to improve the companies' financial condition.'' The Insurance Division will report back to the high court within 30 days on `` whether to rehabilitate them in some ways or declare them insolvent,'' Singer said. `` We will either have a plan to somehow get them back on their feet or we'll have the court declare them insolvent.'' Singer and company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Synder </PERSON> said there is a possibility that a portion of the companies may be sold. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> has signed a letter of intent to buy a small, stock-controlled subsidiary of the companies, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policyholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is unaffected by the order although it too will stop writing new policies. Singer said <PERSON> National </PERSON> <PERSON> Grange </PERSON> has expressed interest in buying American Policyholders, bringing 500 to 600 of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 800 <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> headquarters employees on board and paying off <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term claims `` One of the big assets of this company -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is a well-trained, experienced work force,'' Singer said. <PERSON> Synder </PERSON> said National Grange will be reviewing the potential acquisition over the next 30 days. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> will be looking at cutting its total 1,400-employee work force to handle only claims, <PERSON> Synder </PERSON> said. No decision on layoffs has been made yet. Singer said the companies' reserve capacity has been under review by the Insurance Division since 1985. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> has brought in new management, sold off assets and upgraded its business. `` During the past several years, the company has made great strides in strengthening its reserves to pay losses,'' American Mutual President <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wortman </PERSON> said. `` The reserve accounts have been strengthened by over $ 250 million since 1986. `` However, some very recent changes in payment patterns on old losses indicate that even more reserves may be necessary,'' he said. Singer said the discovery a few weeks ago of $ 500 million to $ 700 million in potential long-term claim exposure prompted one investor interested in buying all three companies to back out and the Insurance Division's decision to seek the receivership order. <PERSON> Synder </PERSON> said it was unclear what direction <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> will take in 30 days. But he said, `` We, obviously, are not going to be the size or shape of company that we were in the past. It all depends on what we can bring out of this.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to cut prices on some of its Macintosh line on Tuesday and then saw its stock drop sharply in heavy trading. The announcement coincided with the company releasing figures for its first fiscal quarter that showed it had a 16 percent increase in earnings compared to a year earlier. The stock fell $ 3.37 -LCB- a share, or 8 percent, to $ 40.62 -LCB- in the over-the-counter market. Some analysts said the stock's sudden spill was unjustified. `` It's a highly nervous market and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> is a highly visible stock,'' said analyst <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Quist. `` There's nothing wrong and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> is stronger than ever,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajarin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategies </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> said it will decrease prices in its <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> division on some Macintosh personal computers, memory expansion kits and hard disk drives. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, the division president, said the company hoped the price cuts on its more advanced models of Macintosh would bring more customers to them. `` Unit sales increased over 30 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and at an even greater rate internationally,'' he said. `` But we also experienced a shift in the unit mix toward less-costly, less-configured Macintosh systems.'' He said the company `` decided to selectively drop prices in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to more fully expand momentum for the full range of our Macintosh product line.'' The company said net income for the quarter was $ 140.5 million, 16 percent above the $ 121.4 million earned in the same period a year ago. Earnings per share for the quarter that ended Dec. 30 were $ 1.10, up from the 92 cents per share. Net sales were $ 1.4 billion, a 35 percent increase over the year-ago figure. International sales accounted for 32 percent of total revenues during the quarter, compared to 28 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1988, according to a company statement. The company's profits rose 84 percent in the last fiscal year, exceeding analysts' expectations. `` The numbers were essentially in line with expectations,'' <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> said of Tuesday's report. Regarding the announcement of the price cut, <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> said the company could be `` repositioning existing products in anticipation of a new product introduction.'' `` I also think the price decline reflects the general slowing of overall industry growth,'' the analyst added. The company pointed to its commitment to new products in Tuesday's announcement.

<HEAD>Ex-Employee Claims IBM Fired Him for Balking at South African Transfer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employee, who claims he was fired for refusing a transfer to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, has filed a $ 25 million lawsuit against the computer giant. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON>, a black naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen born in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, claimed he balked at the transfer to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because he still faces charges for his anti-apartheid activities there. A former <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> marketing representative, <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON> sued the <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company earlier this week at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, accusing <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> of alleged unlawful employment practices. On Tuesday, however, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman disputed <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON>'s claim. `` The termination was not related to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was not an issue,'' said <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> in a telephone interview. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to sell its South African holdings to employees there in October 1986. Ms. <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> said that as of March 1987, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had no assets or employees in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. She declined to say more, adding: `` We do n't comment on cases that are in litigation.'' According to <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON>'s lawsuit, he was hired by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in June 1984 and a year later, was asked to join South African students being trained to work at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s division in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, resident with masters degrees in economics and business administration, claimed he told company officials that he could n't go back to his homeland unless the political system there changed. In 1963, when he was 16, according to the lawsuit, <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON> was twice arrested as a leader in the African Student Association. He was released the first time but sentenced to 21 months hard labor the second time. In 1975, according to court papers, <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON> _ who already was living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ was named a co-conspirator in an alleged 1963 plot to overthrow the South African government. <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON> claimed that after he refused the transfer to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, he was passed over for assignment to a sales territory and was denied funds for courses to complete his doctorate, despite previous company promises to do so. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, the lawsuit named four of <PERSON> Khabo </PERSON>'s former managers and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> as co-defendants.
