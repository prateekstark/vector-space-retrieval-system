 Ships and an airplane searched the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> 1,150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Thursday for 22 crewmen of a Taiwanese fishing vessel that sank after colliding with a sister ship, officials said. Four Taiwanese fishing vessels, two commercial vessels and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol plane were taking part in the search for the crew of the Hun-Kuoa No. 2, which sank after the collision Wednesday, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. So far the searchers have found no sign of the missing men. The Hun-Kuoa No. 1, which was involved in the collision, lost power and was unable to pick up the crewmen who jumped into the water in lifejackets when their vessel began sinking, <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said. The Hun-Kuoa No. 1 later got its power back and joined the search for the missing seamen, he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> P-3 Orion patrol plane from Adak, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, reached the area at midday Thursday and was ready to drop rescue gear to any survivors spotted in the water, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Says LA Too Diverse to Consider Porn Films as Obscene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ruled that certain X-rated, sexually explicit videotapes might violate community standards in some small town elsewhere _ but not in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` There is stuff out there which is apparently accepted by the community which is far more morbid and shocking,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said Wednesday in acquitting a video salesman of racketeering charges. Federal prosecutors tried to prove that tapes such as `` Prisoner of Pleasure'' and `` Kneel Before Me'' could by judged by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> standards as patently offensive. The judge said that in a small community, perhaps, the videos could be deemed obscene. But he added that `` the court ca n't say it in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in this day and age.'' Attorneys on both sides said the ruling may change the government's courtroom tactics, allowing films to stand on their own as evidence rather than calling in expert witnesses to testify about community standards. `` It's an important case and in any future case tried in federal court, it will be cited,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleishman </PERSON>. The case centered on interpretations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision that found that to be obscene, material must appeal to the prurient interest, depict sexual conduct in a manner that would be patently offensive judged by the community's standards, and lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON>, 56, owner of <ORGANIZATION> X-Citement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and R.G.

<TEXT>
 Former dictator <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> has demonstrated a lasting, broadly based popularity in his campaign to win election Sunday to the presidency he once took by force. The 62-year-old retired army general is playing to enthusiastic audiences from all social levels of this poor, largely Indian nation of 6 million. His popularity is a curious phenomenon at a time when dictatorsip is on the decline in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and democracy on the rise. He explained it this way in a speech: `` The people have an instinct that the political hacks have yet to discover. The people remember the good things as well as the bad.'' When <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> was in power from 1971 to 1978, prices for tin, oil and other exports were high, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> enjoyed economic growth and its people were working. After his departure came slumping prices, rising debt, unemployment and rampant inflation. During a tour of slums at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, a tropical city that is <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>'s second largest, packs of ragged youngsters shouting `` Viva Banzer!'' chased his open car through the unpaved streets. He was dressed casually in a sport shirt and waved to cheering crowds. Mothers held up babies to be kissed. The evening before, he attended a crowded fund-raising dinner in a La Paz luxury hotel, where an organization of doctors, lawyers and other professionals gave the former general a gold medal designating him `` Leader of Bolivian Democracy.'' Nearly every poll shows him leading the field of 10 candidates. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> finished first four years ago with 28.6 percent of the vote, but lack of a majority left the decision to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It chose <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, who was second with 26.4 percent. No candidate is expected to get a majority this time either, but <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> hopes to build a large enough plurality to make him the only possible choice for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` A great economic and social development'' occurred under his military government, <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> says. After he was forced out of office by popular pressure for a return to democracy, an economic crisis descended on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the good times ended. Inflation eventually soared to 20,000 percent a year. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> had to adopt drastic austerity measures, including the dismissal of 22,000 employees of state-owned tin mines. Authorities say the austerity program is working, restoring stability and allowing some real economic growth, but it also has meant painfully hard times for many working-class Bolivians. Nationalist Democratic Action, <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>'s party, promises in its slogan a return to `` Order, Peace and Work.'' Opponents and some human rights groups dwell on the former dictator's tactics while in power. The <ORGANIZATION> Bolivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> says at least 33 people disappeared and hundreds were arrested, tortured or forced into exile in a crackdown on leftists, labor and dissident journalists. `` <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> kept the people subjected, violating the most basic human and civil rights,'' <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Villena </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic bishop and president of the assembly's executive committee, said in an interview. `` The people are losing their historical memory,'' <PERSON> Villena </PERSON> said of the public support. The <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> slogan, he said, `` means order imposed from above on those below.'' In campaign speeches, <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> points out that he did not seize power from an elected government. His coup in 1971 ousted a leftist military government that had installed a People's Assembly and planned other communist-style changes. Many civilians, including <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, supported the coup. <PERSON> Villena </PERSON> said <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> relinquished power only when forced to do so by popular resistance, hunger strikes and labor actions. `` Democracy is n't a gift of this dictator,'' he said. `` It was won by the people against his wishes.'' To such arguments, <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> responds: `` We are n't trying to convince our adversaries of today, who only want to listen to themselves, that we are democrats. ... We know that would be like plowing the sea.'' <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> claims democratic credentials on the basis of peaceful participation in the process since forming his party a decade ago and his acceptance of the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to deny him the presidency in 1985. His main opponents this time are <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Losada </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left. He challenged both to pledge their support to the top vote-getter, whoever that is. They refused, saying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must retain its constitutional authority. A new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also is to be elected Sunday.

<HEAD>Federal Health Officials Tinkering With Flu Vaccine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's flu vaccine will have a new formula, designed to better attack the flu strains expected to hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next winter. Two of the three virus strains in the 1989-90 flu vaccine will be different from last year's flu shot, guarding against new strains of flu, the national <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The third ingredient remains the same. The reason: the three major types of flu virus show what researchers call `` drift'' from time to time, changing into different forms that prompt the development of slightly different vaccines to maintain the effectiveness of the flu shot. Last year's vaccine targeted the Type A-H3N2 strain known as the <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> flu and the Type B strain called the <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> flu; next winter's shot will go after two new variations: the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> flu an the <LOCATION> Yamagata </LOCATION> flu. The third ingredient, designed to stop the Type B strain called the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> flu, remains unchanged. `` The prediction is that these -LRB- strains -RRB- look like the likely ones to circulate next year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipple </PERSON>, a CDC flu specialist. Flu vaccine is especially recommended for people who are at high risk of serious problems if they get the flu, including heart and lung patients and elderly people. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immunization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also recommends flu shots for nursing home residents, people with chronic diabetes or kidney disease, people with suppressed immune systems and young people on aspirin therapy, who might develop <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome after a flu infection. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> further recommends flu shots for anyone who simply wants to lessen the chance of getting influenza. Flu season traditionally strikes during the cold weather months. The strains being recommended for the 1989-90 vaccine started to appear in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late last winter, and some are now being seen in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, where the seasons are reversed. `` Those are actually strains that just started to pop up at the end of the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- flu season and are circulating now in other parts of the world,'' Tipple said.

<TEXT>
 In the town of <LOCATION> Kimry </LOCATION>, soap rationing began in April, limiting each man and woman to one bar of household soap and 1 -RCB- pounds of bath soap in local shops. Not each week or month, but each year. The residents of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>, a city of 1 million people in the Urals, are loading up on salt and matches due to rumors of pending shortages. Sugar rationing went into effect in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on May 1 for the first time since World War II, and even the Soviet minister of trade, <PERSON> Kondrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Terekh </PERSON>, has been issued a card entitling him to 4.4 pounds of sugar per month and no more. Those tales of consumer woe, and more, were cited in state-run newspapers Thursday, along with an anguished complaint in the weekly <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News that the Soviet retail trade system, caught between President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbache </PERSON>'s reforms and old iron-fisted bureaucratic habits, `` is literally breaking apart before our very eyes.'' Far from causing store shelves to brim with goods, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for `` perestroika,'' or economic and social renewal, coincides with shortages in the consumer sector nationwide, and some Soviets say the reforms, now in their fifth year, are the direct cause Others blame bureaucrats hostile to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his reform drive. `` The feeling is such that under cover of the words ` the inescapable difficulties of perestroika,' shortages are being created deliberately to indoctrinate this: perestroika on the one hand brings glasnost, which you ca n't put into tea, and on the other hand, a real worsening in the conditions of life,'' wrote <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> in this week's <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News. `` In a word, they're telling us: choose either the old order, with tea and sugar, or perestroika and just boiled water with glasnost,'' <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> said. He opted for water and glasnost, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s openness policy was a precondition for manufacturing enough `` tea, sugar and everything else'' to meet demand. In a speech last week to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged his reforms had failed to improve the average citizen's economic lot, and admitted what most shopgoers already know from bitter experience: Shortages of consumer goods are not shrinking under perestroika, but growing. `` The food problem is far from solved,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said on April 25. `` The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's financial position is grave. The Soviet leader blamed runaway government spending, people who `` forgot how to work'' and top government and party organs _ including the ruling Politburo, which he heads _ for failing to keep up with the tasks confronting them. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top officials have rejected calls to spend more dollars earned abroad through the sale of Soviet oil and other exports to buy consumer goods, saying the money should be spent to modernize Soviet industry so more better-quality goods can be made locally. But last month, Deputy Trade Minister <PERSON> Suran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarukhanov </PERSON> told a Soviet weekly that the equivalent of $ 8 billion had been added to a $ 32.1 billion fund for imports of consumer goods, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> would buy 15 million pairs of shoes, 300 million razor blades, detergent, soap and other goods abroad to parry chronc shortages. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper, said the persistent deficits of consumer goods were why people in <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION> believed rumors that salt would be in short supply. In the resulting stampede to the stores, salt purchases recently skyrocketed from the city's average of 10 tons per day to 250 tons in 36 hours, the paper said A boom in the sale of matches drove daily demand from the customary 157,000 boxes to as many as 2 million, Pravda said. Twenty-six residents of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> who wrote Pravda might well envy the people of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>. The Siberians are forced to bring meat to their village store in exchange for goods, they wrote, and in such quantities `` that for a family of 3-4 people to get shoes and clothe itself, it needs to give 4-5 cows.'' A sweatshirt costs 220 pounds of meat, they said. Pravda said money originally earmarked for heavy industry, traditionally the priority sector in the Soviet economy, should be diverted to help meet consumer demand `` and turn the wheel of economics towards the social sphere.'' But a group of economists and journalists writing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News said less government interference, and not more, was the right recipe. The group, called `` Against Inflation,'' said the country was in the grip of an `` inflationary crisis.'' Economists have projected the Soviet budget deficit, acknowledged for the first time last fall after years of secrecy, will reach $ 162 billion in 1989. `` Against Inflation'' said government control over prices should be gradually lifted, and the mechanism halted that provides automatic increases in pensions and subsidies as consumer goods become more expensive. It also called the <LOCATION> Gosplan </LOCATION> state planning agency and <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> the greatest danger to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms `` What awaits us if the present fiscal and economic policy will continue?'' the group asked. `` First of all, a total rationing system for food. Already today, trade is literally breaking apart under our very eyes.''

 Exhausted by cancer, calamity and revolution, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> struggles to survive and complete what may be his greatest victory _ peacefully handing power to an elected successor. On June 1, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will hand the presidential sash to President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. An adviser said the president `` feels ambivalent, because he began by taking power away from the oligarchy and now it may seem he's handing it back.'' Although the transfer may be peaceful, it will occur in an atmosphere of civil war, killings by death squads and political assassinations. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> spent the past week in bed under an oxygen tent, wasted by dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea caused by chemotherapy for terminal liver cancer. He was strong enough Thursday, however, to rise and receive the credentials of the new Argentine ambassador. The president appeared gaunt and stroked his aching throat repeatedly. He spoke hoarsely but lucidly for 15 minutes, occasionally sipping water because of mouth ulcers caused by the chemotherapy. `` My government has laid the foundation for democracy in this country. I have created here a new concept of politics,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said, and cited as his greatest disappointment `` not being able to leave the country in a process of peace.'' He is given little chance of reaching his 64th birthday in November. The former engineer probably will be remembered for a critical role in gradual and difficult transition from authoritarianism to democracy, but he approaches the end of his term and life burdened by failures and compromises. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> feels he is largely responsible for conditions that make the peaceful succession possible and sees it as a crowning achievement. He also considers <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, an authoritarian, anti-democratic movement that may erode gains in human rights and civil liberties. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said in an interview with foreign correspondents: `` One must acknowledge President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s democratic vocation. He has ... promoted democracy, but I would n't go so far as to call him the father of <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> democracy.'' Since terminal cancer was diagnosed last June, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has made periodic trips to <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for treatment. With rest and intravenous nourishment, he has been able to overcome previous chemotherapy and return to government. His doctor, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saca </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the most recent treatments have been particularly devastating but he is optimistic <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> will recover sufficiently to take part in the June 1 ceremony. During <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s five-year term freedom of expression and labor union pluralism have expanded, politically motivated murder has declined and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has held three nationwide elections judged free and fair by international observers. His main goals of ending the war and reviving a moribund economy, however, remain as distant as when he took office. Leftist guerrillas have fought U.S.-backed governments for nine years. They continue to dominate much of the north and east despite more than $ 3.5 billion in economic and military aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Security forces outnumber the 7,000 insurgents 8-1, but rebels have demonstrated the capacity to attack major garrisons and keep the army on the defensive in much of the country. Recently, in addition to murders in death-squad style, the attorney general was assassinated and wholesale roundups of leftists have been conducted. The home of the vice president-elect was bombed. Attacks on prominent individuals appear designed to provoke or undermine <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. Arena and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials blame the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla alliance, but the rebels have not made targets of high officials in the past. They normally claim responsibility for attacks and have not done so in these cases. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s economy is a shambles and the country would be virtually bankrupt without aid. Private investment, living standards and production of coffee, sugar and cotton, the main export crops, have declined drastically. Health care, potable water and primary education are little more than dreams to most rural people. Corruption and nepotism in <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s administration are described as widespread or rampant, depending on who makes the assessment. The judiciary is ineffective. While death-squad activity has declined, political murder continues. In his state-of-the-nation address last year, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said: `` The will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents. The absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims.'' A ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> `` did n't work miracles, so he has taken a lot of knocks, some fair and some not. ... He merged the party and the government and surrounded himself with some unscrupulous people, but he must be credited with instituting the democratic system itself. His great legacy is this transition.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellacuria </PERSON>, rector of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> for presiding over a military junta in 1981-82, when death squads and the military were blamed killing up to 700 alleged leftists a month. `` <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument that, if he were not -LRB- on the junta -RRB-, there would be more,'' <PERSON> Ellacuria </PERSON> said. He agreed that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had fostered `` formal democratic liberties,'' but added: `` He never realized what little real power he had. He's not a false man, but ... self-deceived. His hands were completely tied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the armed forces.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 His critics pictured Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> as a national kook when he arrived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Now, as he prepares to leave, he has a reputation as a national scold. For seven years, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, the stern family doctor with an Amish farmer's beard, wagged a finger and preached good health practices in direct language that made people squirm. He came to office under suspicion from liberals for his impassioned anti-abortion views, for calling women `` girls'' and for telling graduating high school seniors that motherhood completed the `` whole vocation'' of being a woman. By the time he announced on Thursday that he will retire this summer, he had pacified liberals and gained a fresh set of critics among conservatives. <PERSON> Urvashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaid </PERSON>, a spokesman for the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> helped educated the country by having `` carved out a moderate, consensus position on AIDS.'' But <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s views antagonized such conservative activists as <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> and March for Life leader <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> recoiled from <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s if-you-must-have-sex, use-condoms views on AIDS and concluded that <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> had become indifferent to promiscuity. Liberal Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment, said he had been dead wrong in 1981 when he said, `` Dr. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> scares me He is a man of tremendous intolerance.'' `` One of the great surprises of the last eight years is how wrong I was,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said Thursday. `` If they could find a clone of <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, they ought to appoint him -LRB- as successor -RRB-.'' And Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a leader in the liberals' unsuccessful nine-month fight to block <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s confirmation, said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> had turned out to be `` perhaps the best surgeon general ever The office gives its occupant the right to wear a uniform as head of the 7,200-member commissioned corps of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, but not much statutory authority. An ability to persuade is the chief source of his power. At that, the 72-year-old <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> _ with a square-shouldered presence and the voice of a prophet _ excelled. He was frequently on television talk shows, attaining celebrity status. In office, he: _ Issued a surgeon general's report that told smokers they were addicts, as hooked on nicotine as dopeheads are on cocaine While drugs kill 12,000 people a year and alcohol may lead to 125,000 deaths a year, he said, `` My enemy kills 350,000.'' _ Wrote and mailed to every household in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a pamphlet on AIDS which described in frank terms how the disease is acquired but drew no moral conclusions Mrs. <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s report did not make enough of a distinction between the use of condoms and abstinence from out-of-wedlock sexual behavior. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, then secretary of education, took issue with <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s recommendation that sex education and AIDS education start with young children. _ Jarred conservatives by refusing to issue a report requested by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on abortion's psychological effects on women He said the evidence was too sparse `` to reach scientifically sound conclusions.'' Abortion foes hoped such a report would help persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. An irked <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said it was time for <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> to retire. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>'s decisions surprised all sides in the abortion argument because he had come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a passionate evangelical Christian known for praying at the bedside of his young patients and for traveling the country denouncing abortion as the first step on a path `` to infanticide, to passive euthanasia, to active euthanasia, indeed to the very beginnings of the political climate that led to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Belsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> had been a distinguised pioneer in pediatric surgery, reversing the 95 percent mortality rate on many surgical proceredures performed on newborns. In one celebrated case, he supervised a 23-member surgical team in an 11 -LCB- - hour operation that successfully separated 13-month-old Siamese twin girls He also got rid of X-ray machines in shoe stores that used to measure children's feet and expose them to harmful radiation.

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, offering the broadest view yet of how the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plans to test <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` again and again'' to see whether it will live up to its promises of reform. `` By testing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> across the board ... we can see whether the ` new thinking' is real once we get beyond the slogans,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in a speech on Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> departs Monday for his first round of talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At the May 10-11 session, they are expected to set a date for the resumption of negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles and make preliminary arrangements for a summit between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The trip comes amid a dispute in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> struggles with its allies about forging a strategy to deal with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arms control initiatives. A senior administration official, speaking with reporters about the speech on condition he not be identified, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s speech Thursday was intended as a `` conceptual framework'' for the superpower relationship. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said it is n't clear yet whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be successful with his `` perestroika,'' or `` new thinking'' on matters of democratization and reform. And, he complained, much of the Soviet rhetoric does n't match Soviet deeds. As an example, he cited Soviet actions in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` where the Soviets sent over $ 500 million in aid to the Sandinistas last year.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> applauded moves such as the withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the agreement banning all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But he complained about Soviet shipments of long-range bombers to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadafy </PERSON>, Soviet military support of militant <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Northern Territories. Taking note of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offers to make unilateral troop reductions and make cuts in his defense budget, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said some 3,500 new Soviet tanks continue to roll off the production lines. The secretary faulted the Soviets for failing to publish `` a real defense budget,'' one that would allow an independent evaluation of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge to slash his military spending by 14 percent. He complained that while there has been talk of a `` common European home,'' the Berlin Wall still stands and the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, which affirms the right to send Soviet troops into other East European countries, has not been repealed. The speech marked the most detailed exposition yet of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's emerging policy toward the Soviets, after a lengthy review that some critics say has stalled progress on arms negotiations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has defended the review as part of a `` prudent'' transition from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, plans to outline his views in a series of upcoming university commencement speeches, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said this week. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he intends to use the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit to broaden the U.S.-Soviet agenda to include issues such as terrorism, the environment and drug abuse. `` Our policy must be to press forward with our agenda, to test the application of Soviet ` new thinking' again and again,'' he said.

 `` Welcome aboard <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>. Sorry we do n't serve coffee and doughnuts.'' That cheery greeting from a <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> subway operator, booming from his train's public address speakers one recent Monday morning, drew rueful smiles from suburban commuters lurching shoulder-to-shoulder toward the start of another week in their downtown offices. Shove a microphone in front of some people and they ca n't resist hamming it up. There's something about an open mike in the front cab of a commuter train, pulling a captive audience of several hundred passengers, that tempts subway operators to become amateur comedians and tour guides. Officials of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 70-mile <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> subway system frown on this light-hearted ad-libbing, but most passengers seem to enjoy it. `` Welcome, all first-time riders and visitors to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said one operator as his train swooped down from the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> river bank toward the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. `` You are now 35 feet below the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, so hold your breath!'' Another: `` The next station is <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>, home of the world's largest flying dinosaur. Passengers laughed and applauded when another announced the train's approach to <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and _ his voice dropping to an ominous <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Karloff </PERSON> bass _ `` FOG-GY BOT-TOM.'' One operator on the Yellow Line route heading south across the wide <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> notes that `` this is NOT the place where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> threw the dollar across the river.'' He points out the Jefferson Memorial's cherry blossoms and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` the world's biggest office building'' -RRB-, and tells bad jokes all the way into suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. When his train suddenly filled up with boisterous teen-age tourists, one operator made his customary announcement that `` the doors will openon the right'' at the next station's platform. Then he added: `` For tourists, the doors will open on the left.'' <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucklew </PERSON> says that among the transit system's 345 subway operators who haul passengers on more than 500,000 trips each day, only a handful of those at the controls indulge in good-humored patter. They get a mixed reaction from passengers, she said. Most complaints come from people who, `` if they've had a rough day _ or plan to have one _ a little humor might hit them the wrong way,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bucklew </PERSON> said. `` It's like art,'' she said. `` Some people find it entertaining, others find it irritating. We ask the operators to stick to the script, so to speak.'' The 10-week training course for new subway operators includes three days of special coaching, with rehearsals using tape recorders, on making a few standard announcements over their microphones. These include identifying which line the train is traveling _ Orange, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION>, Red or Yellow _ and its final destination, giving the correct name of each approaching station and noting whether the doors will open on the right or left, plus occasional safety reminders. `` We neither encourage nor condone going off on their own as comics or tour guides,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>'s acting general superintendent for rail operator training. But operators are n't reprimanded unless their off-the-cuff remarks are rude, vulgar or inappropriate. <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> officials say many tourists appreciate being told which station is close to the sights they want to see. Only one operator, accused of `` just being too exuberant,'' has ever been admonished to tone down his act, Ms. <PERSON> Bucklew </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hezekiah </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Briscoe </PERSON>, an 11-year <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> veteran as subway operator and training supervisor, says he plays the straight man while he's behind his train's controls But he does n't mind when his colleagues try to lighten their passengers' load. `` Sometimes a little humor goes a long way,'' he said, `` especially when it's Friday afternoon.''

 Here is a summary of evidence in the trial of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the disposition of each charge: Counts 1-4: Obstruction and making false statements in September and October 1985 in connection with letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> denying that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff was assisting the Contras. Count 1, obstruction. Not guilty: Former National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the source of false information in the letters. But <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> blamed himself, not <PERSON> North </PERSON>, saying the aide `` was probably trying to protect me.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> signed the letters and later pleaded guilty to withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified that he unsuccessfully sought to have the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration invoke executive privilege and refuse to answer the congressional inquiries. The letter to then-House <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said that `` we did not solicit funds or other support. ... We did not offer tactical advice'' to the Contras. A fund-raiser for the Contras, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` Spitz'' <PERSON> Channell </PERSON>, testified that on Sept. 11, 1985, <PERSON> North </PERSON>, after describing the rebels' military needs, told billionaire <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, `` I do n't care if I have to go to jail for this. I do n't care if I have to lie to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about this.'' Hunt later contributed more than half a million dollars to the Contra cause. The conversation was six days after the letter to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and a day before another false letter was sent to then-Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> denying the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> was assisting the Contras North testified he never solicited money for the Contras, that instead he gave numerous talks to prospective donors and then would leave before <PERSON> Channell </PERSON> asked for money.

<TEXT>
 Count 2, false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the Sept. 5, 1985, letter to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. Not guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified he prepared only two innocuous paragraphs of the letter to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. North acknowledged under cross-examination that he edited the letter but said he had no authority to make substantive changes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Count 3, false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the Sept. 12, 1985, letter to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. Not guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified he had nothing to do with the <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> letter. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent testified that a draft of the response to <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> was found in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Count 4, false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with a letter responding to congressional followup questions from <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> on Oct. 7, 1985. Not guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified that his answers were based on information <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> provided. A note by the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel said that <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> was taking complete charge of the job of responding to the inquiries. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, the liaison between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and a private fund-raising operation for the Contras, testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> voiced irritation in a meeting in the fall of 1985 about having to answer `` asinine questions'' from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Count 5, obstructing a proposed congressional inquiry on Aug. 6, 1986, by denying giving military advice to the Contras. Not guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> admitted he told lies in his meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. After the meeting, then-National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> sent him a note saying, `` Well done.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> beforehand it would be unwise to meet with the committee but that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> insisted he do so. The key question was whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to prevent a pending resolution of inquiry into the Contra matter from passing in the House. Only sketchy notes were taken at the meeting in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and no transcript was kept. The judge told the jury to note that `` there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the resolution was or was not pending'' and that jurors had to decide whether the meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON> was designed to gather material for the resolution.

<TEXT>
 Count 6, aiding and abetting obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 in the preparation of a false and misleading chronology saying that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that a CIA-assisted shipment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in November 1985 contained Hawk missiles. Guilty: The jury found North not guilty on the charge of obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this count, but then found him guilty of the subsidiary charge of aiding and abetting that obstruction. Testifying in his own defense, <PERSON> North </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, who by November 1986 had been out of the government for a year, for formulating the false chronology. North also testified that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> knew that missiles were aboard the plane and that other top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials knew because intelligence agencies tracked the shipment hour-by-hour. Despite that, he said, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> helped prepare false testimony for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> saying that no one in the government knew the true cargo until January 1986. North testified that it was necessary to maintain a false cover story about the shipment in order to protect the lives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Iranians were not satisfied with the shipment, and <PERSON> North </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government needed to distance itself from the transaction.

 Counts 7-8, obstructing a presidential inquiry; making false statements. Not guilty on both counts: When then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request, questioned <PERSON> North </PERSON> about the diversion of arms profits to the Contras on Nov. 23, 1986, <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of telling <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> was not involved, that the Israelis determined the amount that went to the Contras and that rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> had been ordered to open Swiss bank accounts to receive arms profit money from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> testified <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him those untruths, but under questioning by the defense he agreed he was conducting only an `` administrative inquiry'' and <PERSON> North </PERSON> was under no legal compulsion to answer. The judge's instructions to the jurors said that to convict <PERSON> North </PERSON>, they would have to find that he had been `` correctly informed of the true nature of the proceeding'' and that his specific intent was to obstruct the inquiry. North denied making untrue statements, saying he readily admitted to the attorney general and his aides the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms proceeds to the Contras. The only written records of the attorney general's meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON> are 29 pages of what <PERSON> North </PERSON> described as `` very cryptic notes'' taken by one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s aides.

<TEXT>
 Count 9, destroying, altering or removing documents from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. Guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> said <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told him to alter five `` problem memos'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> wrote in 1985, to wipe out references of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret assistance to the Contras and <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s knowledge of it. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted the documents changed `` because everything I had done that was described in the documents ... I had been told was at the direction of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> contradicted <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony, saying it was <PERSON> North </PERSON> who suggested altering the memos in 1985 when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> first inquired about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Contra activities. North directed his secretary, <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, to make the alterations in November 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair was about to be disclosed. Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said she shredded the originals without instruction from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, testifying that `` it seemed the logical thing to do.'' To convict on that count, the jury was told, `` the defendant must have known his conduct was unlawful.'' Asked at the trial whether he knew that, <PERSON> North </PERSON> replied `` No, they were his -LRB- McFarlane's -RRB- documents. It never occurred to me that that would be unlawful.''

<TEXT>
 Count 10, illegally accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who <PERSON> North </PERSON> had hired to run arms to the Contras. Guilty: <PERSON> North </PERSON> admitted he never paid for the system, but said he never got a bill for it. He said he did n't know <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> had footed the bill, although it was a meeting with <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinette </PERSON> that led to the installation. After he was fired from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> admitted he tried to conceal the fact he had n't paid for the system by sending two backdated letters to <PERSON> Robinette </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he had gotten the system installed after being targeted for assassination by terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> and just before <PERSON> North </PERSON> was scheduled to go to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an attempt to win release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he tried to get the government to protect his home but was turned down because he was n't high-ranking enough.

<TEXT>
 Count 11, converting traveler's checks to his own use. Not guilty: Contra leader <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> testified he gave $ 90,000 in traveler's checks to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, partly to help in securing release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and partly for the Contra aid effort North kept the money in his office safe. The government charged <PERSON> North </PERSON> spent $ 4,300 of it on personal expenses. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> testified he did n't demand an accounting because `` I would trust him with my life. North denied spending the money on himself, saying he used it to reimburse himself for out-of-pocket expenses connected with his job. The jury was told that to convict <PERSON> North </PERSON>, it would have to find he used the checks `` in a manner not authorized in advance by the owner'' and `` for purposes other than the purpose under which the traveler's checks came into his possession as a government employee.'' In an attempt to bolster its charge, the prosecution brought out that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had paid $ 8,000 in cash in October 1985 for a family car and that until mid-1985 he had complained repeatedly to an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> employee about not having enough money to buy lunch and gasoline to get home. North denied dipping into the office-safe fund for personal expenses, saying he bought the car out of a $ 15,000 cash fund he kept in a metal box bolted to his closet floor at home.

<HEAD>Another Scar On the Fractured Image of Oliver North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A clear-minded warrior, a wearied desk jockey. A born-again moralist, a teller of lies. A patriot convicted of crimes against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A federal jury delivered that last, cruelest cut of all Thursday to the already fractured image of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, pronouncing him both innocent and guilty at the same trial. Guilty, of falsifying and destroying documents, of abetting the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, of accepting an illegal gratuity. Innocent of nine other felony charges linked to his role as action officer in the Iran-Contra affair. In reaching its verdict, the jury had to consider whether this former lieutenant colonel and staff member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was true to his government and his mission, or whether his deceits, principally to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, were the designs of a rogue operating outside the law. <PERSON> North </PERSON> left the courtroom just as he arrived _ eyes straight ahead, shoulders squared, no display of emotion save for a brief embrace with his wife. Later, he would issue this statement: `` As a Marine I was taught to fight _ and fight hard _ for as long as it takes to prevail. We will continue this battle, and with the support and prayers of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people I will be fully vindicated.'' The central figure in the worst foreign policy debacle of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, <PERSON> North </PERSON> came to run some of the administration's riskiest ventures from a cluttered room, No 392, in the Old Executive Office Building next door to the White House. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tried for months to unravel the mysteries surrounding North. But, like the 1987 commission headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, congressional panels left many questions unanswered. Meanwhile, in nationally televised hearings, a defiant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> emerged from his shadowy world, one of pseudonyms and codes and furtive border crossings, to confront his tormentors. `` <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> stood up there, took the heat, and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in every bar in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and every bowling alley in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and every little home said, ` Hey, this guy believes in something, and I can identify with it,''' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last December. North's bravado, and his subsequent whirlwind of $ 25,000 speeches to cheering conservatives around the country, revealed just one of his many sides. He has always been `` Ollie'' to his White House co-workers and the American right. But to his brothers and sisters, his high-school chums back in <LOCATION> Philmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he remains <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. To surviving members of his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat platoon, he is `` Blue,'' leader of `` Blue's Bastards.'' In other travels, he has been `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>,'' or `` Mr. <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>,'' or `` Mr. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>,'' or `` <PERSON> Steelhammer </PERSON>.'' Another code name may be most telling: `` Blank Check.'' That was the term assigned to the private, interoffice computer communications network between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and his superior, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The Tower commission found that the creation of `` Blank Check'' coincided with the initial shipment of anti-tank missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, 14 months before the scheme blew up in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's face in late 1986. According to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first national security adviser, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was brought to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 `` to handle easels and carry the charts.'' Yet he became, in a matter of months, the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief troubleshooter. He was there for the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> in 1983; initial arms shipments by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to the Nicaraguan rebels, also in 1983; the mining of three harbors in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in early 1984; a crackdown on the death squads in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>; the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>; and the bombing raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986. Part of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s ascendancy, no doubt, can be attributed to his own fervor. `` If there was a loose ball,'' said retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, a key player in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s efforts to aid the Contras, `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would grab it and run with it.'' As a youth, he was kept on a tight leash. His father, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel who won a Silver Star in World War II, worked long hours at a family wool mill before it fell victim to polyester and he switched to teaching history. His mother, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, would whistle for the kids to come in every evening at 5 p.m. for dinner. Family ritual included a discussion of world events before the table was cleared. In school, he ran track and was in the chorus, chess, drama and science clubs as well as the student council. The girls voted him best-looking. He was a southpaw boxer at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, making it into the intramural finals against a highly favored <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, later to become <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary. North won again, on points. After his graduation, a review board threatened to dismiss him because of injuries suffered earlier in a car wreck. North made the board look at the film of his fight against <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. He got his commission. Soon after <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> were married, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was shipped out to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where he led the second platoon, <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, 3rd Battalion, Third Marines. Once, despite broken ribs and a punctured lung, <PERSON> North </PERSON> rose up to kill an enemy gunner with a grenade. That got him a Bronze Star. But <PERSON> North </PERSON>, in recounting his <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> record, has sometimes seemed to exaggerate. He has testified that his decorations included `` several'' purple hearts; military records show two. He headed a platoon of 40 men, but said in court that he was a company commander `` in the Special Operations Force.'' Again, no record of it. He has said in court that he was in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> from 1968 through early 1970'' and then again `` in 1971,'' but the corps says it has no record of an extended first tour or second tour. After tours at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> wound up with a desk at <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He worked 18 hours a day. Something finally snapped. North wound up in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for 22 days, diagnosed as suffering `` delayed battle stress.'' Once again, he overcame his difficulties and was cleared for duty. By 1980, he was off for a year of study at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a necessary ticket for a would-be star. Classmates remember he always sat in the front row, always flattered his lecturers. They did n't much like it, but the brass, including <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, was impressed. When it came time to fill a deputy's slot at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the man. One of his responsibilities was coordinating anti-terrorism policies, a license for him to roam the world. It was not unusual for him to jet off at night to another country and be back for the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s regular staff meeting at 7:45 a.m. He flew on White House jets, chartered jets, and commercial airlines, often using false names and oddball disguises. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> called it a `` rinky-dink'' habit. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> did get things done. His finest hour was the apprehension of the hijackers of the <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>, the Italian cruise liner seized by Palestinians who killed an American passenger, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghofer </PERSON>. With the help of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence, <PERSON> North </PERSON> determined that the perpetrators, who had surrendered to Egyptian authorities, were to be flown to asylum in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. He mapped out a plan whereby <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fighter jets intercepted the plane and forced it to land at a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> base in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. North's response in that case, triggered by the sickening, wanton murder of the wheelchair-ridden <PERSON> Klinghofer </PERSON>, reflected an obsessive concern for innocent suffering. He kept pictures of the American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at his desk. When he went to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he would return with photos of women and children living in terrible conditions. Even his severest critics credit <PERSON> North </PERSON> with compassion, noting he played a major role in convincing the administration to pressure <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to bridle right-wing death squads there. His emotional commitment to his causes, the long absences from his family and his marathon workdays continued to take their toll. Co-workers said he often looked like a ghost in the hallways. Former National Security Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> broke down into tears on several occasions when his projects took a bad turn. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> advised <PERSON> North </PERSON> to return to <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> for a rest, but the young colonel would n't relent. North acknowledges some lapses of judgment, including his hand in the phony documentation designed to cover up his acceptance of a free security system at his home. But that, he said, was driven by his concern for family. And, `` I did not commit any crime'' by misleading <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the secret attempts to bolster the Contras, he said on the day he was indicted in March of last year. `` I can assure you, I will never give up.'' On that score, nobody doubts that <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was telling the truth. But his fate may rest ultimately on the shoulders of a man who takes a kind and gentle view of him. Asked if <PERSON> North </PERSON> will be remembered as a hero, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last year `` You know, I think <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> will. And you know why he will? It's not -LRB- what -RRB- went wrong. He said he made mistakes. I'll say he made some mistakes. But he believed passionately in something.''

<HEAD>Consumer Advocate: Subsidized Wheat Exports Threaten America's Own
Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer advocate <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is still nipping at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for operating a popular export subsidy program while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supply drains away. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is executive director of the private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which joined several other consumer groups last fall in seeking a suspension of the export program until 1989 harvest prospects became clearer. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> shrugged off the request and continued to operate the Export Enhancement Program through the winter. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> repeated the request on April 3 in a letter to Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said Thursday that he never did receive a direct reply from <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> or anyone at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. But he did get a response of sorts when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced this week that 1.5 million metric tons of wheat would be sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the subsidy program. It was `` one of those Solomon-like decisions'' by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sell the Soviets only half of the 3 million tons reportedly sought by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and lawmakers from wheat country, he said in a telephone interview. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, as the program is called, private exporters can sell wheat to a designated foreign country at prices lower than otherwise would be charged, in order to make the sale. Exporters then collect a `` bonus'' or subsidy to make up the difference. The subsidies are in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. What concerns <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is the relatively scant supply of wheat held in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> granaries that once bulged with surpluses Some grain experts say there will be enough wheat, that the new crop is almost ready for harvest in southern areas and that some reserves held by farmers soon will be available to the market. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> is n't so certain. As it looks at the moment, he says, the 1989 wheat crop may be `` somewhat under'' 2.1 billion bushels. And if current long-range weather forecasts are correct about below-normal rainfall in some areas in the next few months, parts of the important spring-wheat region could be in trouble, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to have enough wheat to meet the total consumption that we've been supporting the last two years,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to have enough wheat to meet the export demands we'd like to be able to supply.'' Last year's wheat harvest, lowered by drought and substantial acreage reductions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> programs, was only 1.81 billion bushels. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> figures, including leftover grain from previous harvests, the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat supply in the 1988-89 marketing year that began last June 1 was a bit less than 3.1 billion bushels. Out of that supply for 1988-89, domestic use is expected to be around 1.05 billion bushels and exports 1.5 billion bushels, making a total of about 2.55 billion bushels required to meet demands. As a result of the demand exceeding last year's harvest, the wheat left over this June 1 is expected to be only about 549 million bushels. In <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s view, this will not provide enough leeway for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to meet export requirements and still maintain adequate reserves during the 1989-90 marketing year. By June 1, 1990, he said, the wheat stockpile could be down to 300 million bushels or less _ the smallest carryover since 1952 when it was 256 million bushels. For years, farm commodity groups and lawmakers have insisted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be a reliable supplier of agricultural commodities, recalling with scorn the partial embargo imposed on sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1980 by the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration to punish <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for invading <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The export subsidy program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, has operated since 1985 to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign competitors _ notably the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> _ intrude with subsidized sales of their own. About 65 countries have been designated for subsidized sales, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> says the wheat export level of the last two years _ about 1.5 billion bushels annually _ is seen by many as a benchmark for shipments in 1989-90. `` The argument that we have to be a reliable supplier is a powerful force, but we're not going to be able to export 1.5 billion bushels, and if that's the mark of a reliable supplier ... we're just not going to have it.'' A wrangle involving <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> was settled by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could buy 1.5 million tons of subsidized wheat. That's about 55 million bushels, allowing 36.7 bushels per ton. The Soviets have been getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat since <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies were made available four years ago, with purchases totaling slight more than 4 million tons _ 147 million bushels _ since last Oct. 1. The new <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization would push those sales to about 202 million bushels. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the biggest foreign buyer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat this season, has bought half again as much subsidized wheat as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with purchases totaling 8.27 million tons, or 304 million bushels. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, said his group plans to `` continue pushing for use of the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries.'' <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said he understood that as part of the arrangement the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would buy an additional 1.5 million tons of wheat at non-subsidized prices this summer, making up the 3 million tons initially advocated. Asked about matching current export levels in the coming year, <PERSON> Schwensen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should `` endeavor to reach that target'' and added that he thought there will be `` adequate supplies to service the domestic and export markets'' in 1989-90.

<HEAD>North Jury Drew Fine Line Dividing Secret from Public Information</HEAD>

 The jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial drew a fine distinction between lies told to keep a covert operation secret and falsehoods offered when the mission was being publicly exposed. The jury dealt a setback to Iran-Contra prosecutors by clearing the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel of all charges that he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when asked if he was secretly helping arm the Nicaraguan rebels. But the jury convicted North of helping prepare a false chronology of the Iran-Contra affair and destroying key documents once the covert operation's cover was blown by public disclosures. Lying was a major theme of the prosecution's case. Prosecutors argued from the start that deceiving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> damages democracy because government only functions properly when the truth is told. The jury apparently accepted this argument with a caveat _ that deception to protect a covert operation might be justified. Jurors, however, did not fully accept <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s argument that his actions were always justified because he had authority from superiors. `` I think perhaps they drew a distinction between the potential for jeopardizing lives and assets while the mission was still secret and what occurred after public revelations,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Veniste </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> criminal lawyer and former Watergate prosecutor. `` They quite clearly acquitted <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on those areas of criminal activity in which he was acting at the behest of the administration prior to the blowing of the cover on the entire operation in the fall of 1986,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>. `` Once the cover was blown, his actions in aiding and abetting the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in shredding documents were, I think, quite properly deemed criminal.'' North's claim that the verdict is a `` partial vindication'' has some credibility. The jury rejected independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s contention that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was a liar and a thief but found him guilty of other misdeeds _ accepting installation of a security system outside his home by an arms dealer and destroying official documents once the Iran-Contra affair was publicly known in November 1986 `` You ca n't say at this juncture that either side walked away with their theory intact,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> criminal lawyer and a former federal prosecutor. Lead prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was convicted of three `` serious felony charges,'' insisting that `` the principle that no man is above the law has been vindicated.'' `` There is something there for everyone,'' <PERSON> Ben-Veniste </PERSON> said. The jury appeared to have both accepted and rejected <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense that he was only acting on orders from above _ depending upon the circumstances It cleared him of a charge of lying to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members in August 1986 _ apparently accepting <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s explanation that he only met with lawmakers at the insistence of then-national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> The jury, however, convicted North of aiding and abetting the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by helping <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> prepare a false chronology of the Iran-Contra affair in November 1986. `` It appears to be a very fact-bound decision,'' <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. The jury cleared North of a charge he pocketed $ 4,300 of the $ 90,000 worth of travelers checks given to him by a Contra leader to cover expenses. Yet it convicted the former presidential aide of illegally accepting installation of a security system outside his home by arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. On this count, jurors appeared to hold <PERSON> North </PERSON> accountable because he admitted trying to cover up the gift by fabricating evidence he paid for the $ 13,800 security gate. Again, the jury objected to a coverup not justified by national security considerations. `` It really reflects much more the jury's probable dismay at the falsification of bills, preparation of false letters _ again a coverup,'' said Tribe. `` We have here an example of a very careful jury, certainly not a hanging jury, drawing a very careful distinctions,'' he said. The verdict, he added, undercuts `` the elitist assumption that some have made that a group of not very well educated people who were ignorant of the Iran-Contra hearings somehow could n't draw the lines required.''

<HEAD>Regulators Divided Over Legality Of `Silence-for-Money' Deals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Disclosure of `` silence-for-money'' deals between builders and workers at nuclear power plants has touched off a debate among federal regulators over whether to ban such agreements. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Thursday that they could not agree on the legality of one such agreement, which included restrictions on a nuclear plant workers' right to testify at <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licensing hearings The commission chairman, <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he has instructed the agency's legal counsel to study the issue and recommend ways of clarifying <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> policy. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON>, a former electrician at the Comanche Peak nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday he signed a labor settlement with the plant's builder that rewarded him for not telling the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> about alleged safety flaws. <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON>, who is challenging the legality of the 1987 agreement, said his former lawyers `` browbeat'' him into signing, and that he was misled about its terms. In sworn testimony to a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> said he believed `` the agreement prevented me from talking to anybody'' about safety problems he said he observed during nearly 12 months' work at the plant. The subcommittee is investigating how many such secret deals have been made at the nation's 110 licensed commercial nuclear power plants. Officials said earlier this week the panel knows of one other and is seeking details of a third. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Root, the company that built the Comanche Peak plant near <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, told the subcommittee he believed the Macktal deal was legal. But he added that the company wished the law were more clear. <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> signed the agreement to settle his complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Root had unfairly dismissed him as a result of his allegations about unsafe conditions. He said the deal gave him $ 15,000, and his lawyers got $ 20,000. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said he personally believed that such deals are illegal but that some of the four other commissions disagreed. `` Something has to be done about it,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said, adding that late last month he asked all nuclear utilities and vendors to report any such deals to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> by July 31. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON>, a member of the commission, told the subcommittee he was not convinced the Macktal agreement was illegal. He stressed that although it contained some restrictions on <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON>'s right to testify before the commission, it did not explicitly stop him from contacting the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff about safety matters. But Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee, said the <ORGANIZATION> Macktal </ORGANIZATION> deal contained so much restrictive and ambiguous language that it `` strains every bit of common sense in the world'' to believe <PERSON> Macktal </PERSON> would feel free to pursue his safety allegations with members of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff. `` This stinks,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, the venerable retired <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomat, and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the influential chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are challenging President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to do some new thinking about <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, who played a leading role in the post-World War II `` containment'' of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, says in his gentle, diplomatic way that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy seems to be humming along without much recognition of recent changes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who is not a diplomat, flatly accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Wednesday of having no vision and `` shooting itself in the foot'' by not seeking a compromise with a West German electorate concerned about short-range nuclear weapons. The rift, with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> demanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the Soviets and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying that would be a mistake, is straining the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. If it is not healed soon, the orchestration for a smooth <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> May 29-30 with the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries could dissolve into dissonance. Most of the Lance missiles, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> want to make more powerful, are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as part of the 30-year-old <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy of deterring Soviet aggression with the threat of a nuclear response. In 1987, all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear rockets were banned. That changed the strategic picture in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> somewhat. But the Lances, which now have a range of about 70 miles, are visible reminders to the West Germans that the next war might very well be fought on their territory _ and it could be a nuclear war. <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, writing for a <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> think tank before the dispute boiled over, all but anticipated the problem. He noted: Medium-range nuclear missiles are coming out of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is taking more forthcoming positions in arms control negotiations. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has announced unilateral tank and troop withdrawals from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` All these could not fail to raise in West German minds the question of whether the Soviet ` threat' was still so serious as to warrant the indefinite continuation of the military burdens <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been asked to bear,'' he wrote. While West Germans are divided on such questions, <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON> says, many of them are looking for a fresh review of the dimensions of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deployments in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the stance <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is taking in negotiating over non-nuclear forces with the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. But the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and policy planning chief at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says he has looked in vain for evidence that this view is accepted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British and French officials. `` No appreciable changes have been made or planned in the actual disposition of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces, nor do there seem to have been any significant changes in the Western stand on arms control problems recently under negotiation,'' he said. The West German government, a coalition of conservatives headed by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and liberals led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, actually is united on the short-range missiles _ and on demanding a change in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The Germans are saying they will not modernize the short-range missiles and want to reduce, and perhaps eliminate, such weapons on both sides of the East-West line. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is saying no to all of the above, and is prepared to air the dispute at the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> summit meeting. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Wednesday the Western alliance is healthy enough to stand the disagreement, that controversies are a sign of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s vitality. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, however, is uncomfortable with the U.S.-German rift _ and with the administration's approach. `` I do n't see any strategy at all coming out of this,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` I see both sides of this argument as having no vision.''

<HEAD>Commerce, Pentagon Security Agreement is Criticized</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to review government computer security plans gives military intelligence too much influence over civilian technology and data, critics of the plan say. The agreement `` invites'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> `` to enter the offices of private information companies and government contractors'' to help deal with computer security problems, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotenberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION>, a public-interest group based in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rotenberg </PERSON> was one of several witnesses to appear Thursday before the House Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and national security, which is reviewing the 1987 Computer Security Act The hearing focused largely on a memorandum signed March 24 by officials of the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s intelligency agency and the nation's largest, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, a research arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Under prodding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the two agencies have started working closely together to review computer security plans submitted by offices throughout the government for protecting systems containing sensitive but unclassified data. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the subcomittee, said that under the 1987 legislation, `` the relationship between NSA and Commerce was clearly intended to be advisory only, with <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> serving as a technical facilitator to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. He said, however, that he agreed with many people who have complained that the memorandum allows the security agency to encroach upon the central role given Commerce under the statute. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, also chairman of the full <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said any agreement that weakens civilian control in the computer security area `` will result in unwarranted personal intrusions and inhibitors to both domestic and international commerce.'' Also expressing concern over the interagency memorandum was <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belisle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> executive who testified on behalf of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Banks need independently developed security technology that is not pre-empted by <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> control,'' said <PERSON> Belisle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> executive who was representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director for information security, called the memorandum of understanding a `` substantial achievement for both agencies.'' He said that in negotiating the memorandum `` we have been able to develop a better understanding of each other's mission and this in turn has led to renewed confidence and trust.'' `` Key senior officials in both agencies have worked hard to build on the ongoing technical cooperation,'' he said. Also testifying in support of the <ORGANIZATION> MOU </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kammer </PERSON>, acting director of <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION>, which is located in suburban <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, Md. `` The -LRB- memorandum -RRB- provides a number of benefits to <ORGANIZATION> NIST </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>DEA Says International Cooperation Does Exist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top federal drug official says international law enforcement teamwork to fight the war on drugs must be `` transparent to borders'' even when the partner is a country like <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The possibility that drug traffickers might gain access to detailed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> information on investigations `` makes things complicated,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of enforcement. `` On the other hand, we do accomplish things, significant things,'' he said Thursday, adding that, like the investigation of the 1985 slaying of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can pursue dual probes, one involving the foreign government and one on its own. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, he said, maintains an extremely complicated relationship with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the government is virtually controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. While <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug-trafficking charges by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> finds it `` in the best interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' to work with the Panamanian government, he said. `` Less than two weeks ago, they assisted us in a convoy of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on its way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` There are a lot of examples like that.'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> praised the increased cooperation by foreign governments in the war on drugs, and attributed their interest to fears that they could become wracked by drug-related violence, as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has been. He singled out the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government for praise, saying that country is `` making good, solid progress'' in the drug war. The Mexican government's increased interest in cracking down on the drug traffickers stems from successful efforts to curtail the flow of cocaine through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, which has pushed traffickers to find other routes. The routes they found run through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he said. All of the cocaine entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used to come through the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but now one-third of it comes through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he said. `` That has driven a marriage between the traditional Mexican trafficking groups and the Colombian trafficking groups,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said. One reflection of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s increased concern is its arrest April 8 of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, 43, that country's reputed drug kingpin, and seizure of his assets. `` Some say that there is a potential behind this one trafficker to have that government seize up to $ 1 billion in trafficker assets,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said. `` That's one crook. Think about the enormous potential that that money brings in terms of power to corrupt establishments, to buy businesses, to buy real property, to do just anything a person wants. And that person's not unique.'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said international cooperation is one of the few hopeful signs in the drug war. European countries are becoming more concerned about cocaine because there's a glut on the market here, with kilos selling for as little as $ 9,000. The same cocaine can bring $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. `` The seizure rate there is going off the scope,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said, adding that when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> establishes free and open borders between countries in 1992, the situation will get worse. `` I think the picture for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is grim.'' As an example of international cooperation and the far-flung activities of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> cited several major operations, without giving specifics on their targets. One involves five countries, 28 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> offices, 197 individual investigations and 20 wiretaps, 150 informants. Another involves 15 countries, 51 <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> offices, 126 investigations, 60 informants.

 A noted pediatrician says his patients will suffer and die because of attacks by a powerful congressman on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning researcher. `` I can promise you that organizations of patients, when made fully aware of what you are doing, are going to fight this tooth and nail,'' Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> wrote to Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> is physician-in-chief at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and professor of pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, spent most of Thursday in a hearing room attacking the handling of a dispute over a research project led by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON>, a molecular biologist at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> who won the Nobel Prize in 1975 for his work on cancer-causing viruses. `` An attack on him is an attack on our patients. ...

Dr. <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, at the time working on other projects in Dr. <PERSON> Imanishi-Kari </PERSON>'s lab, said the 17 pages showed that conclusions of the paper were not supported by the original laboratory data. Reviews by <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> determined that the conclusions, dealing with the immune responses of mice bred with an extra immune system gene from another species, were fully supported by some 1,000 data pages and no action was needed. A review panel convened by <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>, the one now being resurrected, said that although there was no fraud or misrepresentation, errors had occurred that should be corrected. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> has sent one correction letter to Cell and is preparing a supplemental letter to deal with the latest accusation. A report from <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> experts said at least five and possibly 25 pages in one of Dr. <PERSON> Imanishi-Kari </PERSON>'s notebooks were filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page. At least two dates were changed. The two notebooks studied by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had nothing to do with the Cell article and showed only `` I am not a neat person ... very bad with dates,'' she said. She said she would often use the date on which data were taken, perhaps logged by laboratory equipment, when writing them on paper months later. <PERSON> Wyngaarden </PERSON> said he was establishing an Office of Scientific Integrity to monitor and conduct investigations of possible scientific impropriety. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is establishing an <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> to establish policies to deal with scientific misconduct.

<HEAD>Woman Fights to Keep Shack on Cape Cod Dunes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman seeking to preserve a way of life that nourished some of the nation's best-known writers has asked a federal appeals court to prohibit the government from demolishing her rustic <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> cottage. <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON> said Thursday that she is the last defendant remaining after nearly a quarter-century of litigation over a cluster of historic dune shacks in <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION>. For more a century, the primitive beach cabins have been used as creative retreats by artists, poets, writers and celebrated bohemians, including <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON> said her cottage, built around 1930, represents a piece of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> history and a way of life that should not yield to federal bulldozers. The <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has recommended that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON>'s shack on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seashore </LOCATION> and 17 others belong on the National Register of Historic Places. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which overseas the national seashore, says it has identified shacks visited by notable artists, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON>'s cottage is n't among them. It says cottages frequented by <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> are no longer standing, and there is no proof that the likes of e.e. cummings, <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> spent time in the rickety buildings that still cling to the isolated dunes. In a 1963 letter to one of Miss <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON>'s neighbors, a copy of which was supplied to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kerouac </PERSON> wrote, `` Yes residence on the dunes ... is uniquely sheltering and certainly stimulating to creative work. It's true that I was working on ` On The Road' there, summer of 1950.'' Still, the case before the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> appears to hinge not on its literary merits, but on arcane matters of squatters' rights, the definition of a dwelling and tangled questions of title. The government condemned the shack in 1967, but lawsuits prevented its demolition. Most neighbors, meanwhile, have settled their suits, many under agreements that will allow their cottages to be demolished after their deaths. The government's attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilton </PERSON>, told the three appeals court justices that Miss Bessay does not have clear title to her property, which she inherited from a friend in 1981. Furthermore, he said, the shack does not have the modern electricity, sewage lines or running water that would qualify it as the type of home that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to preserve when it created the national seashore in 1961. Miss <PERSON> Bessay </PERSON> said that is exactly why artists and nature-lovers like it. `` I do n't want a generator banging away and making smells of gasoline,'' she said. Living in a dune shack means `` getting your water by hand pumps, which is a pleasure. It is n't a burden, it's a pleasure. And kerosene lamps for light, that is also a pleasure.'' Miss Bessay, who winters in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, says she is in her mid-60s, but all the litigation has aged her. `` Some days I feel like I'm 110,'' she said.

 Two West Germans doing medical relief work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were freed early Friday, 10 hours after they were kidnapped in the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, a Moslem militia reported. The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, in a statement, said <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, 26, were released without incident at 5 a.m. -LRB- 11 p.m. Thursday EDT -RRB- and drove to their office at the Palestinian refugee camp of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hilweh </PERSON> outside <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The statement said joint efforts carried by its security apparatus and the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia resulted in `` locating the place where the two Germans were held.'' `` They were released at 5 a.m. and crossed the <LOCATION> Sinique </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> area. They are currently at their office in <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hilweh </PERSON>,'' the statement said. It did not disclose further details. Sinique Bridge separates the Sunni Moslem port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of this war-ravaged capital, from the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem sector of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s control. The Nasserite Militia of <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, a Sunni group, has been in control of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> since the outbreak of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war in 1975. German Radio said the man and woman arrived by taxi before dawn Friday in the refugee camp south of this war-ravaged capital. Christian-run Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> also reported their release. The kidnapping had raised to 17 the number of foreigners being held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and was the first to involve in female foreigner. The abduction came less than a week after the prosecution in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> demanded a life sentence for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite, for his role in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane and the murder of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver who was aboard. The West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was closed Friday, the traditional Moslem day off. The West German Embassy in nearby <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said they were waiting for news but could not confirm the report. `` We are hoping for good news, but for the time being there is no news,'' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrage </PERSON>, the embassy spokesman. A spokeswoman for the West German group <ORGANIZATION> Asme-Humanitas </ORGANIZATION> early Friday identified the kidnap victims as <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, an administrator, and <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, a nurse. The group does humanitarian work among Palestinian refugees. The Moslem milita official said <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, head of the Nasserite militia, immediately called Shiite Moslem militia leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and asked him to act urgently to try to secure the Germans' release. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s Syrian-backed Amal militia controls most of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, heads the security apparatus in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> extremist group that is an umbrella for underground factions holding most of the foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Italian, an Irishman and a Belgian are believed held hostage. Longest held is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is believed to have engineered the abduction of two West German citizens, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 in an attempt to win the release of his brother. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 53, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for the West German firm <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987 as he was driving to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. He was released Sept. 12, 1987. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 47, an engineer with <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987, and released September 7, 1987.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considers Way to Keep Osprey Aircraft Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon is weighing a temporary reprieve for the V-22 Osprey, the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> aircraft that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> proposed terminating to meet a compromise fiscal 1990 budget agreement. On Thursday, Deputy <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that the department is considering either continuing the Osprey through a `` flight test program'' or a `` minimal effort of technology demonstration.'' The decision is expected shortly with the department facing a threat by the contractors, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to stop work on the project today. `` What we have here is a game of high-stakes chicken,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who noted that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` will not issue a stop-work order, that we will continue to require the contractor to complete the testing program under the terms of the contract.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the companies received $ 245.8 million in March on their fiscal 1989 contract and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> expects completion of the contract. The companies have been using their own money because of $ 27 million in cost overruns that could total as much as $ 150 million by the end of fiscal 1989. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, forced to slash $ 10 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense budget to meet an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and congressional leaders, eliminated the battlefield aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane. The Pentagon had planned to spend $ 25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys, including $ 1.3 billion in 1990. The department had already invested $ 2 billion in the program over a nine-year period. Both the flight test program and the demonstration program would require reprogramming of money, according to <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, who said a pot of $ 330 million exists for certain materials for production of 12 aircraft. The funds could be used if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved. `` We hope to have a decision within a matter of a day or so,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> told the panel. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s decision, which he has described as his most difficult, has met with considerable opposition on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where both Republicans and Democrats attacked the planned cancellation. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` appears ... to be playing games with us,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> knows how strongly <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> feels about it and intends to put it back in.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> threated not to vote for any defense authorization bill that leaves out funding for the Osprey program. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., who discussed the issue with <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> prior to the hearing, said the department should `` explore the possibility of maintaining at least enough efforts to keep <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> in operation to maintain the status quo while this matter is evaluated by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> cast doubt on the information <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> used in deciding to eliminate the Osprey. `` I do not agree with the cost advice that he got nor do I agree with the military operation use and conceptual framework of that, but then I'm but one voice,'' Commandant <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do you believe Secretary <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> made the best decision he could make based on faulty information?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services panel `` No,'' responded <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, `` but based on the information he was given by learned people who have their right to believe that they're correct.'' `` But you do n't believe they're correct,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` No I do n't, but I had my day in court,'' said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who plans to submit to the committee his interpretation of the program's cost benefits.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Calls For Dialogue With Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> called for a dialogue with students in authorities' first public comment following historic pro-democracy rallies in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, official media reported today. Students marched by the tens of thousands to occupy the square Thursday and rally for more freedom. Some returned to class today to end a two-week boycott but student leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> refused to immediately call off the strike. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, in a speech made Thursday but reported today in the party organ <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Now we need broad consultations and dialogue _ dialogue with students, dialogue with workers, dialogue with intellectuals.'' Student activists want the government to open talks with them on demands for democracy, freedom of the press and an end to official corruption. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, while saying talks were needed, did not specifically promise any meeting. The party leader acknowledged that great numbers of Chinese are expressing anger toward official corruption, and attributed the problem to a lack of openness and a faulty legal system. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that students were being manipulated by people who wanted to see the country in turmoil. Such people `` are extremely few and we should maintain vigilance. I think the vast majority of students understand this.'' Despite conciliatory official statements, some students feel they must continue to pressure the government if concessions are ever to be made in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Who announced the return to class? Can you face your conscience and compatriots at home and abroad who have cared for us and supported us?'' one student scrawled furiously on a sheet of newspaper that he posted at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Said an economics student who was reading the poster, `` If we go back to class now then there's no pressure on the government and it wo n't recognize our independent union.'' Student leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they had not been notified by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella group that has led the protests, of the decision to return to class. A few classes were held at the university, but most students stayed away. Some classes also were held at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Dozens of other students sat in classrooms studying on their own and said they expected to resume their normal schedules on Monday. The student march Thursday was their sixth in defiance of police orders since April 17, and one of the largest. About 100,000 people, half of them students, converged on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic seat of power, to mark the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement. There, they held a festive rally for greater freedom, cleaner government, a free press and official recognition of their <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have to transform <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said a 20-year-old student from the <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents lined the streets as the students passed and gave them applause, free drinks and cash donations. `` We strongly support the students,'' said a man in grimy blue work clothes. At a few intersections marchers had to shove their way through hundreds of unarmed police lined six deep, but the government clearly wanted to avoid serious confrontation. The security presence was smaller than a week earlier, when about 150,000 students and supporters marched on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. Although authorities had ordered the square closed Thursday, the police who surrounded it offered no resistance and quickly left when the students arrived. <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, one of the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said after the rally that the students' struggle for democracy and reform has entered a new phase that will focus on spreading their message through pamphlets and setting up independent newspapers as an alternative voice to the official media. Several official newspapers today carried their fullest accounts yet of any student protest since the campaign for democracy began. `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s temperature yesterday hit 30 degrees centigrade -LRB- 86 Fahrenheit -RRB-, but students streaming with sweat held a march just as orderly as the last time,'' <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. It also reported smaller marches in more than 11 cities, including <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nanjing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION>, where students had marched before in the past few weeks. No violence was reported in any of the marches. The Legal Daily said the <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> students applied for and received police permission for their demonstration. The demonstrations marked the May Fourth Movement of 1919, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement. It began in opposition to concessions granted to the Japanese government during World War I, and developed into a movement calling for `` Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science'' to save <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A new newspaper focusing on the homeless has hit the streets with the aim of inspiring the nation's homeless and opening the public's eyes to their problems. `` This is their newspaper. ... All homeless are not inhabitants of skid row. They have feelings, self-worth and the desire to have a place to call home,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON>, editor and founder of the monthly `` Freedom from the Streets,'' which made its debut Thursday. <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON> said his long-term goals are to get the homeless involved in the newspaper with contributions of art, poetry and prose. With a staff of four, the paper also will showcase success stories of some who have triumphed over homelessness to become self-sufficient. `` The best psychologists in the world are the ones who have been through it,'' he said. `` A homeless person writing about homelessness picks up the true feelings of despair.'' Some 8,000 copies of the paper's first edition have been printed, <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON> said. He planned to distribute the papers free to local shelters, as well as offering $ 10 annual subscriptions to social agencies across the country. <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON> said he hopes the paper will be self-supporting with advertising. <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON>, who was homeless himself for two years, said he was lucky enough to enter a treatment program four years ago to overcome alcoholism and get himself back on his feet. Before that, `` I was riding the rails. ... I stopped running and starting dealing with my realities.'' Now he's taking classes at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and working on a bachelor's degree in chemistry. About 3,000 people in the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> area are homeless and those figures climb to about 5 million on a national level, he estimated. Lawmakers on federal and local levels need to start tackling the problem by building more affordable houses, said <PERSON> Halsey </PERSON>. `` The -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration said people were homeless by choice,'' he said. `` We have to overcome that rhetoric, that philosophy. ... People are sleeping on heat grates within visible distance of the White House.''

<HEAD>Winner of $7.1 Million Lotto Says He'll Pay $25,000 Back Child Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lottery millionaire from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> has decided to ante up $ 25,000 in back child support to avoid prosecution by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> authorities, according to his attorney. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>, who won a $ 7.1 million Lotto jackpot in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on April 22, failed to pay both court-ordered and voluntary support for his children, who live in the blue-collar town of <LOCATION> Revere </LOCATION>, just outside of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, state child support officials said. The boys, who turn 8 and 9 this month, live with their mother on public assistance. Several hours after a felony fugitive arrest warrant was issued in <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, state officials said they reached an agreement with <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for him to send the $ 25,000 in back child support and the warrant would be withdrawn. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said the state will likely lift the criminal charges facing <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> once the money is received and a new child support order is instituted that will allow the children to get off public assistance and `` reflect <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>'s current standard of living.'' State officials were tipped off to <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>'s lottery win last Thursday by a local resident who read an account of the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> drawing in a newspaper, according to <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>. The back support dated from 1981, <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> had agreed to voluntarily pay support until 1986, when he and his wife were divorced. Under the terms of the divorce, <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> was ordered to pay regular support. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> faced penalties of up to a $ 10,000 fine and five years in prison. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> and his fiancee, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, who used some of their laundry money to buy the winning ticket, stayed incommunicado for several days after the winning number was announced, consulting with a lawyer and celebrating in grand style, before stepping forward April 25 to claim the first installment of $ 134,725. They will receive 25 annual installments. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> said while claiming the prize at a news conference that winning the lottery had n't changed anything, `` other than instead of buying $ 12 dinners, we buy $ 1,200 dinners.'' The pair said they would use the money to open a restaurant. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON>, a free-lance public relations and political consultant, has been working for the Street Smart program designed to help inner-city youth. <PERSON> Tecci </PERSON> has said some of the jackpot would go to benefit the program. In a similar situation, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> authorities have seized all or part of the jackpots of 203 state lottery winners to pay overdue child support. At least one winner lost a $ 10,000 jackpot, <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resouces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shay </PERSON> said Thursday. In all, $ 226,000 in delinquent child support has been collected by the department since the lottery interception program began six months ago. A 1987 bill authorized the state to seize lottery prizes of winners who are $ 150 or more behind in child support payments.

<HEAD>Study: Women on Pill More Than Four Years Risk Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young women who take birth control pills for more than four years run a significantly higher risk of breast cancer, according to a study published today in a prestigious British medical journal. Researchers were quoted in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lancet </LOCATION> as saying that among women 35 or younger, they found a 43 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer after four years of pill use and a 74 percent increase after eight years. They called on doctors to tell women about the possible risks of breast cancer before they prescribe contraceptive pills, but they did not advocate avoiding oral contraceptives. However, <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilvers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one of the authors of the study, advised women to aim for the lowest-dose pill available and stay on it for the shortest possible time. `` Women who are not having intercourse should stop taking it,'' she said Thursday at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> news conference. The study is the most comprehensive look at the pill and breast cancer ever undertaken in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and one of the largest in the world. The researchers were quoted in the medical weekly as saying the risks of taking the pill had to be kept in perspective. `` Breast cancer is uncommon below age 36, the age group that was studied. Only one woman in 500 develops the disease before age 36, so even a 70 percent increase in risk would only put the chances of developing breast cancer by this age up to about one in 300,'' the researchers said. Earlier studies on the relationship between the pill and breast cancer have conflicted. Last January, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> committee of experts declared that recent research on possible links between the pill and breast cancer was inconclusive. The British study involved 755 British women under age 36 who were diagnosed as having breast cancer between the beginning of 1982 and the end of 1985, and an equal number of similar but cancer-free women. The researchers, from <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and two leading British cancer charities, said they still could not answer the `` crucial question'' of whether the increased risk persisted after age 36. They said they are undertaking a study on women ages 36 to 45 `` to help resolve this vital issue.'' `` The most consistent interpretation of our results and those from previous studies is perhaps that the excess risk is transient and diminishes or disappears at older ages,'' they said. The researchers said their study included only those women with breast cancer who had the opportunity to use oral contraceptives from the start of their reproductive lives. Since the pill has been available in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since the early 1960s, they decided to include only women age 36 and under at the time their breast cancer was diagnosed. The researchers said 91 percent of the women with breast cancer and 89 percent of the comparison group had used the pill at some time. The relative risks were similar for women who used the pill before and after their first full-term pregnancy, the researchers said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctors </ORGANIZATION> said the new study `` does not clarify the continuing debate about the pill and breast cancer risks.'' The two organizations said women now on the pill who are concerned about the findings should discuss their cases with their doctors. They said the risks had to be balanced against the pill's benefits in protecting women against ovarian and other types of cancer

<HEAD>Despite `Zero' Observed Risk, Rubella Vaccine Inadvisable During
Pregnancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seventeen years of study of rubella vaccinations on pregnant women show chances of fetal infection are small, but health experts warn that women still should be vaccinated long before they get pregnant. Although rubella, once known as German measles, is mild in most cases, congenital rubella syndrome _ rubella at birth _ can cause blindness, retardation and heart defects. Since the rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> have recommended against pregnant women getting the vaccine because of the possible risk of passing rubella on to their babies. No cases of congenital rubella were detected in the children of 305 women who participated in a study from 1971 to 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The women were susceptible to rubella and received rubella vaccine within three months of conception. `` The observed risk for CRS following rubella vaccination continues to be zero,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that researchers in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also have found no vaccine-related congenital rubella syndrome. However, the virus in rubella vaccine has been shown to cross the placenta and infect the fetus; one study shows an infection rate of 3 percent. `` Thus ... because the theoretical risk to the fetus, however small, can not be absolutely ruled out ... pregnancy remains a contraindication to rubella vaccination,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Immunization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> continues to recommend that while `` reasonable precautions'' should be taken not to vaccinate pregnant women, `` inadvertent vaccination of a pregnant woman should not be a reason in itself to consider interruption of pregnancy.'' `` Nothing -LRB- in the way of vaccine-related CRS -RRB- has been observed, but it's still a theoretical concern, and it's been shown the virus can be transmitted through the placenta,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> immunization specialist. `` So the conservative argument is that the contraindication is a reasonable precaution.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends rubella vaccinations for women who are potentially susceptible to the disease. Rubella, a once common childhood disease, was reported in only 221 cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. There was one case of congenital rubella syndrome in 1988.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two months of fighting for the strategic city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> has demonstrated the unexpected tenacity of the Afghan armed forces and exposed weaknesses in the divided guerrilla opposition. Each day the Soviet-backed government holds the provincial capital, the more confident it becomes it can withstand a guerrilla siege and force the insurgents and their Western supporters to negotiate peace. For nearly 10 years, the guerrillas _ known as mujahedeen _ waged their holy war against the Soviet army, which entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to prop up the Marxist government. The enemy was an invading superpower to them and the battle lines were clear. But now the Soviets are gone, and the guerrillas have come down from the mountains to the rocky plains of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. They are trying to move from hit-and-run attacks to full-scale conventional warfare in the largest and bloodiest offensive of the 11-year civil war. So far, neither side is winning. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have said 7,500 to 12,500 insurgents and government soldiers have died or been wounded during the eight-week siege. There are no estimates on casualties among <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>'s civilian population, which once numbered about 64,000 The guerrillas have pounded the eastern city with as many as 16,000 rockets a day. The forces of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> have responded with long-range Scud missiles and have dispatched MiG-21 and MiG-27 jets to pound guerrilla camps. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and its magnificent gardens and palaces has been virtually destroyed. Refugees are fleeing the carnage by foot and on flatbed trucks. The mujahedeen are fighting as fiercely as ever, but with little coordination or military discipline. Seven guerrilla factions set up a government-in-exile in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in February but still do not have a cohesive ideology or consistent popular support. Meanwhile, government forces have proved they can fight effectively without Soviet troops to back them up. The soldiers are driven in part by fear of death or torture if captured by the insurgents. When the Soviet army rolled into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took advantage of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s relationship with guerrillas who had taken refuge there. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sent weapons to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military intelligence service. The Pakistanis delivered them to the guerrilla leaders, who handed them out to their field commanders. But the arrangements created rivalries among the insurgents and undermined efforts to unite the resistance. `` Until <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, few in the West listened to complaints about the resistance. While the Soviets were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, it did n't matter Now it does,'' said one diplomat with ties to both sides. When the U.N.-sponsored accord calling for the Soviet withdrawal was signed last year, the lack of a coherent guerrilla government-in-exile became a prime concern, and it was left to Pakistani generals to shape one. The Soviets completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15, and the Pakistani military began pushing the mujahedeen to attack <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> so they would have a place to set up their government. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say the siege was orchestrated primarily by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military and based on the theory that the city would fall quickly and pave the way for the final push on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital. Several insurgent leaders boasted that <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> would be theirs within a day. But their predictions proved wrong and their self-imposed deadline was pushed back to weeks, then finally months. Some observers say it is time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> changed strategies if it wants to lead in negotiating peace. `` If the mujahedeen and the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government reach a compromise with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s help, it will be a credit for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said another diplomat who also spoke on condition of anonymity. `` But if the Americans work through <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, their policy will fail. The Afghans and the Pakistanis have been enemies for a long time. The Pakistanis will just push on to fight, and the Afghan nation will be finished. If that happens, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will lose all the credit it has earned.''

 Criticizing the health care provisions in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> renewed his call for universal health insurance while commemorating the 125th anniversary of his alma mater. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who last spoke at <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> while seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, told about 400 people, mostly <ORGANIZATION> Swarthmore </ORGANIZATION> students, that plans to cut into Medicare are `` unconscionable and unacceptable.'' He said the budget would cut Medicare by $ 2.7 billion. `` These cuts, if approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will continue to shift costs to private insurance plans, a trend that is already raising the cost to employers, who have to cut benefits, increase co-payments and deductibles and require larger employee contributions,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> graduated in 1955 from <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, whose charter was approved by the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Legislature 125 years ago Thursday. The liberal arts college, about 10 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, has an enrollment of about 1,320. Before his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ate dinner with old classmates, professors and students who campaigned for him. `` My only regret is we're not doing this on the East Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canada Opens 9-Mile Rail Tunnel Under Glacier National Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROGERS PASS, B.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest rail tunnel, a nine-mile stretch under Glacier National Park, has opened to link <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s coal and mineral-producing hinterland with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries. The tunnel was inaugurated Thursday in a ceremony accented by the sound of bagpipes and attended by rail executives, industrialists, politicians and some of the 1,100 railway workers who worked on the $ 422 million project. The new route, completed ahead of schedule and $ 84 million under budget, ends the cumbersome practice of adding extra locomotives to trains that had to negotiate 4,000-foot <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> and should increase westbound capacity by as much as 60 per cent, authorities say. Major improvements, including the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macdonald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, reduced the steepness so that pushers are no longer needed on the southeastern <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> route. `` This is the biggest thing the railway has done since the building of the transcontinental,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, can now run four-locomotive freight trains from <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> and, without the aid of the pusher trains, increase the number of freights through <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> daily from 15 to 24. `` After nearly 104 years of railroading in these <LOCATION> Selkirk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, we have finally tamed the geography _ or at least as much as man is ever likely to do,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The project involved double-tracking the CP Rail main line through <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. It was the last of four double-tracking and grade-reduction projects undertaken by the railway in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. Lighter eastbound trains through <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pass </ORGANIZATION> will use the old track and the <LOCATION> Connaught </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, which opened in 1916. The new route also will be used by passenger trains. CP Rail officials say the project will have a significant impact on the ability to move export commodities such as grain, coal, sulphur and potash to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. `` This was built for the future,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a senior railway spokesman. `` It's solid advance planning.'' <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> hopes to pay for it over 20 to 30 years depending on revenues, but will realize savings immediately from the elimination of about 20 pusher locomotives from service.

 Vice president <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, heading home from his 12-day trip abroad, walked along an oil-soaked <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beach and told workers `` it's going to be an enormous effort'' to clean up the Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` I've been very impressed with the number of people, the number of ships and the magnitude of the cleanup,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said of efforts to remove oil the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> spilled into waters off the scenic <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast March 24. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stopped here before flying today to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he was to brief President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at lunch on his 12-day trip to five <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and Asian nations, his second trip abroad for the administration.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pro-government candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> urged 100,000 followers to use their vote in the presidential election as a weapon `` to cut off the hands of those who sold <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for $ 10 million.'' Speaking Thursday in May 5th Plaza at his final major rally before Sunday's election, <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> said though that he was willing to resolve Panamanian differences with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` on a basis of respect and non-intervention.'' <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> has leaned heavily on allegations <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> authorized $ 10 million for the opposition and pointed to it as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to make <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` just another star on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag.'' Duque faces opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> in a race to succeed acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. The balloting, however, is viewed as a referendum on strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year on drug trafficking charges. International observers include two former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents who planned to monitor the balloting. Despite government insistence that voting will be free and fair, the opposition and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> claim that the pro-government alliance will steal the election. Alleged American attempts to thwart Panamanian dignity and independence have been rallying points of the pro-government coalition throughout the campaign. `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not be bought for $ 10 million nor for all the gold in the world,'' <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> told a cheering crowd that waved colorful party flags and stood under banners reading, among other things, `` <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>: The World Is Watching You; Hands Off Panama!'' <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> said the eight-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> he represents is the only group that can guarantee stability, bring together the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people and deal effectively with other countries. Government employees, who make up about 20 percent of the work force, were given the afternoon off to attend the rally and thousands were trucked or bused to the capital from around <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Panamanian law mandates all campaigning end tonight at midnight. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> held its final rally Wednesday, saying Sunday's vote is `` the last peaceful opportunity for change'' and hinting they would take to the streets if the results appear rigged. There is no official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer delegation, although former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> arrived Thursday at Howard Air Base near the capital. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the rest of the delegation he heads, under the auspices of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Governments, were to due arrive today. There were reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would send a delegation despite Panamanian statements that an official observer delegation would not be welcome. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been under military rule since 1968 and has had only one presidential election since then, in 1984. The opposition contends a return to democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not possible with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the head of the military. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has denied the drug trafficking charges, calling them an excuse to get rid of him in favor of someone more willing to respect American wishes, especially regarding the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under 1977 treaties signed by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the late Panamanian dictator <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the canal is to be taken over by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government contends the opposition alliance will stop or delay the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> takeover of the waterway. In February last year <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the drug indictments. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate ruler. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last year to try to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out. The opposition press has been closed for more than a year in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Thursday's pro-government rally was widely broadcast while Wednesday's opposition rally, which drew a similar crowd, was not.

<HEAD>North Verdict Applauded, Attacked in Editorials</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-North, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspaper editorials across the nation today generally applauded <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s conviction as showing no one is above the law, but some papers said the former national security aide was persecuted for political ends. `` The verdict should remind future officials in the executive branch that they are not above the law, however just they consider their cause and however much backing they enjoy from their superiors,'' said the Rocky Mountain News in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said the jury `` rendered a service to common sense and common decency,'' and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s conviction on three felony charges `` reaffirms the American principle that even high government officials are accountable to the law.'' But some papers said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was a victim of political motivations. `` The offenses <PERSON> North </PERSON> was found guilty of were woven of political gossamer and fashioned by a frustrated opposition,'' said The <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. `` North is guilty of one thing, of over-zealousness in the service of his country, his president, and liberty. He should be pardoned.'' North was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as shredding and altering documents in November 1986 and of accepting a $ 13,800 home security system in mid-1986 from Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> North </PERSON> had enlisted to run arms to the Contras. He was acquitted of nine other criminal charges. Many newspapers said <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not emerge from the trial as a villain, but his conviction was a victory for the judicial system. `` The verdict is satisfying not as a triumph for opponents of Mr. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s policies but as a vindication of law and orderly process; that, and a solemn judgment that the law, however politically disagreeable, must be respected by its servants,'' said The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said although <PERSON> North </PERSON> was found guilty on just three counts, `` that was enough to make the all-important constitutional point that even heroes must obey the law.'' In one of the strongest editorials, The Atlanta Constitution said <PERSON> North </PERSON> had a gift for appearing sincere `` and was a clever embroiderer of fictions. In the surer light of the courtroom, however, he was less than convincing. <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hero, is now a convicted felon.'' Other newspapers expressed a different viewpoint, questioning in particular the expense to prosecute North. `` Given the multimillion-dollar investigation and prosecution, we would say that it is the taxpayers who are going to be paying for the zealotry of Mr. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and congressional liberals,'' said the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times-Dispatch. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> said the trial proved `` that if you spend $ 13 million to prosecute one man, you're bound to get a conviction on something.'' The Daily News in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the verdict may have long-term consequences for the executive branch of government. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s shadow long will hang over the sort of free-wheeling, defiantly extra-legal dealing that <PERSON> North </PERSON> engaged in, proudly. And that, ultimately, may be of far more consequence to the health of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy than any of the damage done by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s shallow indifference to the law.'' Whether the nation will ever learn the full story of the Iran-Contra scandal is still in doubt, according to The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> trial, unfortunately, cast little new light on the Iran-contra fiasco. The misguided scheme to aid secretly and illegally the Nicaraguan Contras _ which turned into a scam to swap arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for American hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, with the profits plowed back into the anti-Sandinista cause _ remain a frustrating whodunit, a pulp mystery with a convoluted plot and the last page torn out of the book.''

 The mental condition of the Central Park jogger who was raped and beaten into a coma last month continues to improve, but doctors say her recovery is threatened by a 106-degree fever. Meanwhile, Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> suggested Thursday that cameras be placed in desolate areas of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> to alert police to the presence of roving gangs like the one that allegedly attacked the woman jogger. At Metropolitan Hospital Thursday, doctors said the rape victim called her father `` Dad'' for the first time since the attack. `` We do feel, mental status-wise, that she is improving,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, assistant chief of surgery. `` On the other hand, we are obviously concerned about the source of the fever.'' The 28-year-old woman, who remained in a coma for two weeks after the April 19 attack, regained consciousness Tuesday, speaking in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members. Her condition remained critical despite her progress, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. The woman's parents have maintained a vigil at the hospital since the attack. Six teens have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault in the case that has brought an outpouring of concern from around the city. The woman, an investment banker, was on her regular jog through Central Park when the mob pounced on her. The alleged attackers were members of a teen-age gang of more than 30 youths who went to the park for a night of `` wilding'' _ random attacks on anyone they encountered while roaming the area, police said.

 A 13-year-old with muscular dystrophy who was able to scream and push her attacker while she was raped was n't `` physically helpless'' under law, according to a court ruling that sets the man free. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided Thursday that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who's serving a life sentence for the crime, should not have been charged with rape against a physically helpless victim. The 4-1 ruling upholds an appeals court decision that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> should go free because he was prosecuted under the wrong law. Although the girl, who uses a wheelchair, can not move her legs, testimony showed she screamed for help and tried to push the man away as he raped her twice in the 1985 attack. By law, the high court said she does n't fit the definition of physically helpless. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 46, was sentenced in 1987 as a habitual offender and remains at the <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. Court officials said he could be freed within 30 days. He can not be tried again for the crime because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's provision against double jeopardy. `` This was our court of last resort in this case. The decision leaves us with the conviction overturned,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Corces </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` There can be no more appeals.'' In February, the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION> ruled that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was tried under the wrong sexual battery law. The victim was not `` physically helpless'' as defined in the rarely used law that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was prosecuted under because she was not `` asleep, unconscious or physically unable to communicate her unwillingness to the act,'' the appeal court ruled. The alleged rape occurred in <LOCATION> Davis </LOCATION><LOCATION> ' </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alfred </LOCATION> home, where he was taking care of the girl. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Toward </PERSON>, the attorney who won <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' appeal, said Thursday that he was happy for his client.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Soviet Troops Involved in 1979 Afghan Coup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet troops were involved in a coup in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before the new leader invited <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers to enter that country in 1979, a Soviet historian said in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the time has come to tell the whole truth, however bitter it is,'' historian Y.V. <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Abroad, books have been published on the subject. Silence from us only causes rumors and speculation.'' Western sources previously have reported that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> forces moved into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before leader <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>, considered a Soviet puppet, issued his invitation. But this is the first indication in a Soviet publication that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may have engineered that invitation. Speaking of the attack on the president's palace on Dec. 27, 1979, which killed <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> and led to <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>'s takeover, <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> said, `` From conversations with our officers, I learned that our unit, which was included in the limited Soviet military contingent, also took part in the operation.'' `` The clash did not take long,'' <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> added. `` And, with the exception of <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s personal guards, nobody even made an attempt to defend the regime he headed.'' According to a book by Western journalist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, `` Caught in the Crossfire,'' <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> had just rejected a Soviet demand that he either resign or make a formal request for Soviet troops to intervene in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The next day, <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> claimed power in a broadcast on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Radio </LOCATION>, and asked for Soviet `` political, moral, military and economic assistance,'' a request repeatedly cited by the Soviets as the reason for their intervention. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> says <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON> was actually in <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the time and the broadcast was made using a prerecorded tape. <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> also argued with reported statements by Gen. V.I. <PERSON> Vanenikov </PERSON> that the intervention was necessary to protect the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Of course, having a hostile government in power in a neighboring country could not be satisfying to us. But it did not follow that we had to react to the situation the way we did in 1979,'' he said. `` Political, diplomatic steps could have been taken,'' he said. <PERSON> Gankovsky </PERSON> also repeated earlier reports that the decision to send troops to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was taken by former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and a handful of others. Former Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s opposition to <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> was partially motived by fury over the murder of <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s precedessor, Marxist President <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>'s murder has to be taken into account when considering the steps taken by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Observer in a recent interview.

 A man already serving a life sentence has been convicted of 13 counts of aggravated murder in the abduction, torture and stabbing deaths of six women. <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> put his head in his right hand, shook it, and said `` No'' repeatedly as the first guilty verdict was read Thursday night in <ORGANIZATION> Clackamas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He covered his head with his hands, leaned forward onto the defense table and looked away from the jurors as they individually were asked their verdict. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was charged with killing six women after kidnapping and torturing them _ a total of 12 counts of aggravated murder under state law. A 13th count of aggravated murder held that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> killed one of the victims during sexual abuse. The conviction carries a sentence of life in prison or death by lethal injection. Jurors will determine the sentence in the trial's penalty phase, beginning May 22 Prosecutor <PERSON> Andrejs </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eglitis </PERSON> refused to comment on the case after the verdict was returned, saying the penalty phase still needed to be heard. <PERSON> Lotus </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, the mother of victim <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotus </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, said her family was n't sure if it supported the death penalty, but was glad <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was convicted. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> already is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> prostitute in a suburban parking lot in 1987. The jurors heard 127 prosecution witnesses over five weeks, while the defense called no witnesses. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was convicted in connection with the deaths of the women, all known or suspected prostitutes who were stabbed repeatedly in the back. Investigators testified that feet were sawed from three of the bodies. Their bodies, and a seventh that has not been identified, were found in late August and early September 1987 on a hillside near <LOCATION> Molalla </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>.

 Coffee is $ 2 a cup, but it is not the prices that have residents of this northeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> borough up in arms over Dad's Coffee Shop. It's the topless waitresses serving the coffee. About 1,100 of the borough's 6,700 residents signed a petition last month saying Dad's Coffee Shop `` or any other enterprise of this obscene nature'' should go. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Siderowicz </PERSON>, who headed the petition drive, said `` trashy-type people'' frequented the coffee shop off Main Street in the borough just north of <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>. `` This is a small-town atmosphere. We do n't need this kind of clientele coming up to <LOCATION> Dickson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he opened Dad's Coffee Shop on Feb. 15 to provide a bar-like atmosphere without alcohol to people 18-and-older. `` I see myself as a trendsetter,'' <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> said. `` You're not going to get smashed drinking coffee. It's an idea whose time has come.'' But the borough has started legal action against <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON>, saying he violates the local zoning laws by providing entertainment without a special permit. `` He advertises the waitresses, not the coffee,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maholick </PERSON>, borough council president. `` Where else do you pay $ 2 for a cup of coffee in a styrofoam cup, no refills?'' <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> was given a cease and desist order April 19 citing the alleged zoning violation and a hearing has been set for May 25. He could be fined up to $ 500 a day. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON>'s attorney, said topless waitresses were n't providing entertainment at the coffee shop, which is open from 6 a.m. to midnight and serves food from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. `` There's no dancing. There's no singing. ... They're simply waitresses,'' he said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> added that Dad's Coffee Shop is located in an area zoned `` highway commercial,'' which he said allows entertainment. At lunchtime on a recent weekday a dozen customers _ 11 of them men _ sat in chairs on both sides of the narrow wood counter in Dad's Coffee Shop, a dark room set between a pizza parlor and a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. A waitress who gave her name only as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> served customers coffee, or simply sat on the counter and talked with them. <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON> said the outfits _ or lack of them _ drew the customers, but the service kept them coming back. `` What I'm providing is excellent, excellent service: very friendly girls who will go over to a stranger and talk to them and make them feel like they belong,'' he said. <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, 28, from nearby <LOCATION> Clifford </LOCATION>, said Dad's Coffee Shop was an alternative to bars. `` For people who choose not to drink, it's kind of like the bar without the booze,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, ordering a black coffee and a $ 1.25 hamburger. <PERSON> Wasley </PERSON>, 45, thought of the topless coffee shop after selling a go-go lounge he owned in nearby <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> last December.

<TEXT>
 Tree Top, the nation's largest apple processer, says it will break contracts with apple growers who use the chemical Alar on this season's crops. The growers' cooperative in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Thursday the move was to allay consumer fears over reports that Alar can cause cancer. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> rejected apples that were treated with the chemical, which makes apples redder and crisper. Under the expanded ban, no apples will be accepted from any growers who uses Alar on any of their apple trees, even if the specific apples submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Top </ORGANIZATION> are n't treated with the chemical. `` Tree Top is trying to step up the pressure to eliminate Alar from the apple industry altogether,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Selah-based growers' cooperative. Tree Top previously urged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to ban Alar use altogether, and it has requested the chemical's manufacturer, Uniroyal, to stop its production. The chemical is legal to use but it has become highly controversial since the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this year that the chemical leads to cancer in children. The report was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other federal health officials, who said the Alar present in some apples was not enough to endanger humans.

 Growers are worried that there's too much sunshine visible through the Sunshine State's famed orange juice these days. Although <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s juice tastes as sweet as ever, it's gradually becoming paler, according to many of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 12,000 growers and more than 30 citrus processors. `` This industry is running into real trouble,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, a veteran citrus grower and processor from <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION>. `` The color issue is something we need to consider.'' Consumers apparently prefer darker orange juice and industry insiders fear today's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange juice _ which often is more yellow than orange _ could affect the state's $ 4 billion a year industry. `` Color perception is very important to consumers, but it's only a perception,'' said <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON>, who retired last year as senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and has served 16 years on the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The truth is, dark juice can be less tasty, depending on the variety, <PERSON> Hamrick </PERSON> said. `` The problem is already acute,'' warned <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Attaway </PERSON>, director of scientific research for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>. Part of the problem has been the weather. Devastating freezes in 1983 and 1985 destroyed about 200,000 of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s more than 847,000 acres of fruit trees. Today the state has about 700,000 acres and in recent years growers have been planting at the rate of more than 50,000 acres a year. But growers seeking to harvest their fruit before the January and February freezes are planting oranges that mature early. The main early-season juice-fruit, the <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> orange, ripens as early as October and produces a sweet juice. Unfortunately, juice from <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> oranges is far lighter in color than the late-season <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> orange, which matures from March through June. Processors seeking a product of uniform color often blend early-and late-season fruit, and the color of a lot of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange juice is fading as an ever-higher percentage of <ORGANIZATION> Hamlins </ORGANIZATION> moves into the mixing vats. The juice could become still paler in coming decades as newly planted <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> trees reach their production peak.

<TEXT>
 Police today filed charges ranging from murder to obstruction of official duty against 76 radical students arrested in connection with the burning deaths of six police officers. Police in the southern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> charged four student leaders with arson and murder. The charges carry a maximum sentence of death. Lesser charges of violent acts or obstruction of official duty were filed against the other students. Police also said they were looking for 16 more students in the case. Six riot troopers were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday when they tried to free five police officers held hostage by radical students at <ORGANIZATION> Dongui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. Authorities said the troopers became entrapped in flames when students poured paint thinner in a corridor and set it ablaze to stop the raid. Student leaders in <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and other parts of the country expressed condolences for the dead officers. They described the troopers as victims of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo's `` undemocratic system'' and said they will not end their campaign to topple the government. Students said they will wear mourning ribbons until the officers are buried Sunday in a funeral ceremony. Following the deaths the governing and opposition parties agreed to enact a law that would ban firebombs, a weapon commonly used by dissidents and radical students in anti-government protests. A draft law calls for up to seven years' imprisonment for people who use firebombs. Those who manufacture or carry firebombs could be sentenced to up to three years in prison or fined up to $ 4,600.

 The verdict in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial is not likely to end revelations still trickling out from the Iran-Contra affair, says one of the chief congressional investigators. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, who was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that delved into the affair in 1987, noted that more trials are yet to come, and that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> committees are looking into why some key documents that came out at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial were never turned over to congressional investigators. `` We certainly did n't find out all the truth in the Iran-Contra hearings,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind. `` We'll be learning bits and pieces about Iran-Contra for years to come, and after the statute of limitations runs out we'll probably find more.'' `` The North trial raised a number of questions that I think are still unanswered,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said this morning on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show `` We still have many, many unanswered questions about Iran-Contra and those should be pursued. And certainly important documents that came out in the North trial, we should understand why we did not get those documents,'' he added. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' meantime, `` I think what you'll find when the investigation is complete ... no documents were withheld if there were, it was inadvertant. there was certainly no conspiracy ...'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> moved Thursday to begin a staff investigation into what key documents failed to reach <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and why those papers were not turned over by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The panel's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> counterpart already had begun such a probe. `` The documents are important and clearly were within the scope of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` It is up to us to pursue the implications of those documents to their conclusion.'' Documents introduced in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial indicated that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a deal in 1985 in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would expedite economic and military aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for that country's continued help for the Contras, who were encamped just inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras was banned at the time. The documents, together with trial testimony, suggested that senior officials up to and including former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were more involved in the affair than the congressional committees knew. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself spoke out for the first time on the subject Thursday, giving reporters `` the word of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' that `` there was no quid pro quo.'' He said he would turn over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> records of his 1985 meeting with the Honduran president. One main document introduced at the trial, a 42-page admission of facts stipulated by the government, said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did approve a deal and that expedited aid did begin flowing to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid, said he would hold up all aid to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> until the contradictions are cleared up `` I simply feel we have an obligation to find out what the facts were,'' Obey said. `` The sad truth is that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> apparently has been lied to for years.'' The White House has offered to make available to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who oversaw the document search for the congressional Iran-Contra committees and gave assurances that all relevant documents had been provided. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigators already have identified at least six documents made public during <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial which failed to come to light during the 1987 congressional probe. Most of them point to a deal with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to expedite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in return for help for the Contras. Among them are a Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining such a plan and approved by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and a memo dated the following day making it clear that the administration knew it was forbidden to provide aid under those circumstances.

<HEAD>Border Patrol Cuts Back Extra Agents As Number of Central Americans

 A sharp drop in the number of Central Americans trying to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> to scale back extra forces detailed to the south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border, an official said. Immigration officials say the drop in apprehensions means get-tough policies are discouraging Central Americans from coming here to file frivolous applications for political asylum. Central American apprehensions in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have fallen from 200-250 a day in early March to a current level of 50-60 a day, E.J. <PERSON> Vickery </PERSON>, assistant chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McAllen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sector </PERSON>, said Thursday. From January to March, the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> McAllen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sector </ORGANIZATION> added 192 extra agents to stem a flood of other-than-Mexican aliens entering the country illegally. The bulk of the extra agents brought in from other parts of the country patrolled in the <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> area, the closest border crossing point to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The agency began detaining nearly all of those apprehended, rather than releasing most on their own recognizance, as it had been doing. The crackdown accompanied an Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy that began Feb. 21, in which asylum applicants are processed in one day and immediately detained if their initial claims to refugee status are denied. The number of extra <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has been cut to 102, and may be reduced further if apprehensions continue to drop, said <PERSON> Vickery </PERSON>. There are 395 agents permanently stationed in the McAllen Sector. He said the word of a crackdown has reached <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` If you're caught here you are detained, then your case is heard immediately,'' he said. `` It's not like it was before when they were released and traveled north never to be heard from again.'' <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials also say the number of people turning themselves in voluntarily to apply for political asylum has plummeted from 500 a day in January to a current level of fewer than 10 daily in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` In fact, on Tuesday of this week, we did n't have any applicants,'' said <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>

 A plumber's proposal to turn a southwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> county into an AIDS Free Zone has gotten a cold reception from authorities. `` This is an invasion of the rights of citizens,'' <LOCATION> Josephine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It also reminds me of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. This is much more frightening than any threat of the AIDS virus.'' She was reacting to a ballot measure proposed Wednesday by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Heimos </PERSON> that would amend the county charter to require mass testing for the AIDS virus and possible expulsion for those who test positive. `` I decided that this county has a high Christian value to it and that AIDS would certainly wipe out a huge portion of the population should it start to spread very rapidly,'' the Grants Pass resident said. He must gather 1,824 signatures to put the measure on the ballot. The earliest election date available would be in May 1990. <PERSON> Heimos </PERSON> wants to administer widespread tests and publish the results. Those to be tested under the proposal include children in public schools, public employees, many jail inmates, applicants for county permits or licences, people known to have had extra-marital affairs and those who engage in high-risk behavior. The proposal calls for the county <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to quarantine those carrying the virus or expel them from the county.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> toured sludge-fouled beaches on his return from a 12-day Pacific tour, and said today <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> must do more to clean up the devastation wrought by the nation's largest oil spill. `` It's going to be an enormous effort,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Thursday as he looked at a beach on hard-hit <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, an important haulout area for seals. Workers have been laboring for days to wash the beach clean. Then at a news conference early today, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said it appears <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> believes its cleanup plan is adequate, `` But I believe <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s going to have to do more than they think they're going to have to do,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and joined by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and federal <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, ended his <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> trip Thursday with a six-hour, wind - and rain-swept tour of the spill zone The vice president's jet arrived from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the fishing town of <LOCATION> Cordova </LOCATION>, about 50 miles from the site of the March 24 spill, which was caused when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> slammed into a charted reef outside shipping lanes and poured 10.1 million gallons of crude through its shattered hull. Oil from the slick has been spotted more than 520 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> past the tiny village of <LOCATION> Chignik </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Alaskan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. State environmental officials said Thursday the oil is moving in some areas at the rate of 17 -LCB- miles a day. The ship's skipper, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, has pleaded innocent to operating the vessel while drunk and is being investigated by a grand jury for potential felony charges. His trial is set to begin June 20 in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Before the news conference, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, dressed in jeans and a flight jacket, met with Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> and more than a dozen mayors and leaders representing areas affected by the spill. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters that although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not personally visited the spill site, he has expressed his concern by sending top federal officials to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> earlier met with two dozen local officials at <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, who urged him to support the expansion of a local salmon research facility to study the effects of the spill. `` You can count on it,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told one resident. He also agreed to serve Alaskan salmon at the White House. Traveling in helicopters, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his entourage then went to the USS Juneau, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s command center for the cleanup, and to <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Oil from the spill has spread to the spectacular Katmai National Park, a wildlife refuge. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials Thursday proposed arming the guards of their workcrews with shotguns to protect them against the bears. Currently, guards are carrying chemical sprays to fend off animals. But state and federal environmental officials were concerned that inexperienced guards might shoot the bears needlessly. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which is financing the cleanup, has offered a plan to clean 364 miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline by mid-September. But nearly 200 of those miles would be left untouched by cleanup crews and allowed to be cleansed by natural wave, wind and rain action. The company also says it may require exemptions from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s strict environmental laws to dispose of the waste it collects, either through burning, burying or waste-water treatment The state, responding to a request from <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> to evaluate <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s revised cleanup plan, was sharply critical of the proposal, saying it was inadequate and did n't provide for enough personnel to do the job Exxon President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>, at a news conference in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> offices, denied the company was trying to cut corners in the cleanup. But he complained that as many as 14 government agencies may be involved in approving and carrying out the final plan. `` I want one person in charge _ I do n't care who it is _ because there has to be one person that finally says, ` Hey, it's midnight and we've got to do something,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said. `` Anything reasonable, anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do in addition to what you have in the plan, we'll do it.''

 Searchers looking for 22 crewmen of a Taiwanese fishing vessel that sank 1,150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have had to contend with 10-foot seas and 40 - to 50-knot winds, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said A piece of a life raft believed to be from the Hun-Kuoa No. 2 was all that was found before darkness set in Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said. The vessel sank Wednesday after colliding with a sister ship, the Hun-Kuoa No. 1, which helped in the search along with three other Taiwanese fishing vessels and two commercial vessels, <PERSON> Goff </PERSON> said.

 Calls for a presidential pardon in the wake of three guilty verdicts against former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> are producing disagreement in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but most of those commenting concur that <PERSON> North </PERSON> should spend little or no time in jail. Many conservatives called for a prompt pardon by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ including some conservatives _ said that would be premature at best and that the judicial process should be allowed to run its course. Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, whose pardon of ex-President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> caused a furor and may have cost <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> re-election, declined to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advice on the subject. `` I have very strictly taken the position that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on that publicly. ... It's a very very personal -LRB- decision -RRB- to the presidnet, as I found out from my own experience,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigating committee, said on `` Today'' this morning that `` this is not an instance where a presidential pardon is appropriate, nor is it an instance where he should have extended sentence ...'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said earlier that the `` fact that Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> was in a difficult position does not absolve him of his responsibility, but it may go toward mitigation of his punishment. Opinions varied widely on the federal jury's split decision _ convicting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> on three charges, acquitting him on nine others _ and on the ultimate meaning of his role at the heart of the mystery known as the Iran-Contra affair. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' that while he opposes a pardon, the commutation of a prison sentence would be `` totally appropriate. `` I do n't think there should be a prison sentence. I do n't think there ought to be any kind of a harsh sentence at all. I do think it is important to establish for the future that there's no ambiguity, that no matter what you think other people may have ordered, you simply ca n't rip up documents and you ca n't mislead the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as long as national security was n't involved,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` I think he's a very tragic figure,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I find no evidence of remorse on his part because he really believes he was doing what he was supposed to do. `` I do not think <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> understands to this day what the constitutional issues were all about,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pardon <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, declared that `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> deserves a medal, not a prison sentence.'' `` I predict there will be an avalanche of conservative outcry for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to pardon <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON> said. `` I think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should pardon him,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who was one of North's stoutest defenders in the Iran-Contra probe. But <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and other senators said that step would almost certainly cause political problems for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, similar to those faced by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> when he pardoned <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the Watergate scandal. `` The president's problem is that if he does pardon him there will be shouting and screaming from the same partisans who have been out to hang North from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Some of <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s conservative colleagues disagreed on the pardon issue. `` I do not want to see a pardon because I think the court system is working very well,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R-S. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, also opposed a pardon saying, `` The man was indicted and the jury decided that the facts upheld three of the indictments. It's obviously a tragedy for him and his family. But no one is above the law.'' `` As a former prosecutor I was n't surprised at the verdict,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. `` What the jury is saying very clearly is that <PERSON> North </PERSON> should n't be taking the blame for the whole thing, he should n't be a fall guy. But <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said a presidential pardon would `` make a mockery of the whole system.'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said a pardon would be `` outrageous. `` I take the president at his word that there will be no pardon,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said and added: `` It seems to me the jury came to the conclusion that you can not lie and that you are not allowed to go ahead and shred documents, that you are responsible for your actions, that you still have to obey the law even though someone else told you to do it.'' Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, on whose watch <PERSON> North </PERSON> took the actions that resulted in the Iran-Contra scandal and his trial by jury, declined to comment because <PERSON> North </PERSON> still faces a long process of court hearings and appeals. But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the decision reaffirms the panel's findings that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the others involved in the Iran-Contra affair `` showed disdain for our laws and constitutional system of government. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., who also served on the Iran-Contra committee, said he felt `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> was left twisting in the wind by an administration he served with all his heart and soul.

<HEAD>Stampede Kills 19 When Clothes Offered To The Poor In Bangladesh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of destitute women struggled to get 500 free saris being distributed in <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION> today, triggering a stampede that killed at least 19 women and injured 70, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> reported. A wealthy merchant in <LOCATION> Chandpur </LOCATION>, 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, wanted to hand out the saris to celebrate the Eid al-Fitr feast marking the end of the holy Islamic month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the news agency said. But the sari distribution was halted after the stampede. Most of the brightly colored lengths of cloth intended for the poor lay scattered and bloodstained on the ground, the news agency said. More than 2,000 women, many of them dressed only in rags, gathered outside merchant <PERSON> Fazlur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>'s house before dawn, the agency said. By the time a guard opened the gate at 8 a.m., the crowd had swollen to more than 3,000. Some of the women surged through a small portico and swarmed up the narrow stairs. In an effort to halt the onrush, the guard closed the iron gate but the stampede grew worse, the news agency said. Distribution of gifts is an Islamic tradition at the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting. The custom, called `` zakat,'' requires the rich to give the poor a portion of their earnings in the past year.

 Evangelist Oral <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who said in March he needed $ 11 million by Saturday to save his ministry, will ask creditors for more time if the $ 4 million still needed is n't raised this weekend, ministry officials said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Swadener </PERSON>, chief financial officer for the ministry, said officials will meet Monday to determine whether the fund-raising goal was met and if they need to request more time from vendors. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said in late March that he must raise $ 11 million by May 6 or creditors will begin `` dismantling'' Oral <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and City of Faith hospital. The university also would be unable to meet the payroll for its 2,130 employees, he said. `` Based upon where we have been, it looks like we will have to talk to the vendors about an extension,'' <PERSON> Swadener </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 71, said monthly contributions to his ministry have been cut nearly in half, dropping from $ 5 million to $ 2.7 million, and blamed `` a spirit of skepticism'' after scandals in the ministries of evangelists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. He said his ministry was in `` a life-or-death struggle'' to pay the six months of past-due bills. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> announced Tuesday that the university's athletic programs were dropping out of <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> competition immediately to save an estimated $ 500,000 to $ 1 million a year.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations today pressured quarreling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to open talks on reducing tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said such negotiations are tied to efforts to trim conventional forces. Soviet and East German diplomats used today's resumption of East-West talks on conventional weapons to jump into the dispute within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance over reducing short-range nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and some European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members want superpower talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose them because of the Soviet advantage in conventional weapons. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> also want to modernize the short-range missiles. East German Ambassador <PERSON> Klaus-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> insisted at today's resumption of conventional arms talks that parallel talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons are vital to Germans `` The shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans,'' he told a news conference, referring to the fact that East and West Germans are most threatened by the short-range weapons. The absence of parallel negotations on nuclear weapons `` would of course have negative effects'' on the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on conventional arms, he added. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, worried about the sliding popularity of his center-right government, supports talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons and wants to postpone a decision on modernizing the weapons until after next year's elections. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks opened March 9 with a mandate that specifically excluded nuclear rockets. But Ernst and Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> said that the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weapons and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and increase security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said he was disappointed when every East bloc speaker at today's closed-door talks mentioned the nuclear weapons, `` even as they admitted they have no place in this negotiation.'' `` I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount of discussion in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> camp,'' he told reporters, referring to the internal <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> rift. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> stressed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> squabbles over nuclear weapons will have no effect on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> unity at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks. `` We are in complete unison,'' he said. <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> used today's session to outline a plan dividing the zone covered by the talks _ from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains deep inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ into smaller regions. He said the two sides should work to agree on overall totals for the number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, but also agree on totals for each region. The regions included a central European zone comprising <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> side, and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. It is in this area that most of the deadly weaponry of both military blocs is massed. But <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> failed to provide any overall weapons ceilings or for the zones. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said such totals were vital for progress at the talks. At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by 1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, by contrast, presented a more specific proposal for ceilings on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. Both sides declared their willingness to get down to specifics today, but remained divided over which weapons categories they want to cut first. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact will have more than a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> even after recently announced unilateral troop cuts are carried out in the Soviet bloc. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced in December that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would pull out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by 1991. The withdrawals began last week in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with the departure of 31 T-64 tanks. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said today that further unilateral cuts by the various <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut its troops by 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems, 1,010 combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 `` nuclear systems.''

 Government should allow certain levels of toxic pollution in the air and drop the current goal of a total ban, says a draft developed by officials working on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean air package. `` The zero tolerance level mandated under current law is suboptimal and if continued would be extremely costly, politically difficult and would threaten the shutdown of many plants in several industries from court mandates,'' says the document, a copy of which was obtained Thursday. The draft document provides options for pollution control ranging from assessing health risks against industry costs, to setting standards for 125 pollution categories to leaving the whole matter up to the states. The draft's options on airborne toxins are to be reviewed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Domestic Policy Council before going to the president with a recommendation as part of his Clean Air Act revision plan. The plan also will include sections on acid rain and attainment of urban ozone standards. Some environmental activists who obtained the document denounced its proposals as too weak to protect the public against airborne poisons. The draft deals with the attempt to arrest the 2.7 billion pounds of poisonous chemicals that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates are released into the atmosphere each year. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is now required to assess the risk of each chemical, and then develop a chemical-by-chemical emissions standard designed to `` protect the public health within an ample margin of safety.'' Analysts from the environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday attacked the draft proposals as a weak effort. `` None of the options are going to protect the public from toxic air emissions,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> resource specialist <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shieman </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> is a private, non-profit organization. She criticized the principles listed in the document, which stated only that reductions should be achieved `` as soon as possible,'' and that reduction of health risk be `` balanced against economic and technical feasibility considerations.'' Clean air bills are already pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and more are expected to be introduced. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan is expected to be ready within a month. The draft lists three initial regulatory options for industrial polluters. The first would set an `` unreasonable risk standard'' to balance the benefits of regulation against its cost. This standard, the document said, `` could be coupled with a commitment to address a specific list of the industrial sources posing the greatest risk,'' with a period of perhaps three to five years. The document acknowledged that such an approach likely `` would be criticized as not protective of public health.'' The second option would turn the standards question over to the states, and have each state issue permits for individual industrial polluters, specifying acceptable emission levels. The third option would list `` about 125 industrial categories for control on schedules requiring controls by dates 5 to 12 years after promulgation.'' This alternative would rely on polluters using `` maximum available control technology,'' to control emissions. Newly constructed pollution sources would have to use the best achievable technology to cut pollution, but the option said that must be done `` considering costs and technical feasibility.'' Existing polluters would use technology defined as the `` maximum achievable ` in common practice' by the ` better performing sources.''' It would also allow exemptions for several categories of polluters. That `` common practice'' language, said <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> clean air specialist <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, is worrisome because `` common practice'' could be read as current procedures that do not necessarily employ the best technology. One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear when the draft would be considered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Domestic Policy Council of advisers, which includes Cabinet members and key officials who advise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on domestic matters Airborne toxins are one part of the package, which will also include smog and acid rain, that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is preparing to propose as a new Clean Air Act.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, visiting Jewish victims of an Arab stabbing attack, said today that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> citizens should make sure terrorists do n't escape unscathed. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visited a hospital where two survivors were recovering from Wednesday's attack, in which two elderly Israelis were killed and three others wounded as they sat at a bus stop in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Such incidents `` anger us,'' and `` we have to act against this,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. He noted that a large contingent of police reinforcements, believed to number 3,000, have been deployed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to prevent further attacks during the Eid Al Fitr holiday which marks the end of the Moslem's monthlong Ramadan fast. But he added that citizens also had to play a role. `` I think the general public and the Jewish public must do their utmost in order to defend themselves and in order to prevent murderers from doing their deeds, and in order to prevent them from coming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in remarks broadcast on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Parliament member <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Oron </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as criticizing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for calling on the public to take the law into their own hands. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, said the premier meant to say citizens should help police in guarding against attacks and in apprehending perpetrators. He said there was no intention to encourage vigilante actions. After Wednesday's attack, Israeli passersby chased, caught and beat the Arab attacker. Police intervened to rescue the man. Later, reinforcements were called up to stop reprisal attacks on other Arabs by angry Israelis. Police arrested Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, leader of the anti-Arab Kach party, and seven of his followers for disturbing public order. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s followers had tried to march to the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where they said they would attack Arabs. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> supporters today staged a protest, demanding his release. The Palestinian who carried out Wednesday's attack in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> appeared before a judge, who ordered him held for an additional two weeks. The man, 25-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Razik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON>, is from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION> and told police he acted alone. He had a bandage on his ear and bloodstains on his shirt. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said he asked for a lawyer so that his views would be clearly represented. Police said he had been a member of a fundamentalist organization, and the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> -LRB- or Holy War -RRB- group claimed responsibility in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said five Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers, four of them in the <LOCATION> Shajayeah </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said masked youths left mosques after noon prayers shouting `` God is great,'' and started setting fires and blocking streets. At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the 17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 7,000 Moslems attended prayer services at the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> mosque marking the end of the Ramadan fast. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafrawi </PERSON>, who delivered a sermon, protested that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities prevented hundreds of thousands from coming to the mosque.

<HEAD>Woods Hole Scientists Locate Thermal Vents On Floor Of Mediterrean

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists using a camera-equipped robot that scours the ocean floor have found the first known thermal vents in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and they expect discoveries of exotic creatures to follow. A leader of the undersea project by the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's finding will have broad implications for marine biology and geology. Marine biologists previously have discovered foot-long clams, 12-foot tube worms and other exotic animals living on the floor of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> oceans near thermal vents, which are deep cracks where hot minerals well up from the Earth's core. The Woods Hole team said it expects that never-before-seen creatures also will be found near the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> vents, discovered about 120 miles from where a remote-controlled submersible robot will explore a sunken Roman ship in 2,100 feet of water off the coast of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` Each place where thermal vents have been found before, we've come across new animals And each place, they've been different,'' said <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauzon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the oceanographic institution on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. The robot, named <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, will transmit live pictures of the Roman trading ship and ocean floor to an estimated 250,000 schoolchildren at 13 museums from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, the oceanographer in charge of the $ 7 million Jason project, found the first known undersea vents near the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1976. Since then, researchers have found similar vents in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and mid-Atlantic. <PERSON> Lauzon </PERSON> said all the vents have been surrounded by chemosynthetic bacteria, unusual organisms living in darkness and feeding on chemicals that are toxic to virtually all other forms of life. The bacteria, in turn, are believed to start the food chain that supports exotic animals found nowhere else, including foot-long clams and mussels in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and eyeless shrimp and hairy snails in the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The fact that vents have now been found in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> indicates that they may well be in all of the world's oceans _ which in turn implies that the diversity of deep sea life may be far greater than previously thought, <PERSON> Lauzon </PERSON> said. Some scientists also have said that the discovery of chemosynthetic bacteria and organisms that feed on them makes it more likely that life could exist on distant planets under extreme conditions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> project coordinator and assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> at Woods Hole, said how the discovery of the vents was made was itself a significant technological advance. In the past, such explorations required scientists to spend a month or more at sea, viewing videotapes of the ocean bottom that were taken by submersible vessels. On Thursday, a satellite hookup enabled scientists at Woods Hole to see the ocean floor as <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s camera saw it and to summon colleagues who could look and offer their opinions, <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> said. `` This is remarkable, that I could get an authority here in two or three minutes, who did n't have to dedicate a whole month at sea to participate in this event,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, regarded as one of the best young hockey players in the world, defected to the West to play in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, according to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and Swedish news reports. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, 20, failed to show up Thursday at <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>'s airport to join the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> on its return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The national news agency, <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION>, reported that <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> left this morning on a Scandinavian Airlines System plane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION>, who hold <ORGANIZATION> Mogilny </ORGANIZATION>'s rights, said they knew nothing of the defection <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said Thursday night that general manager <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> left town Wednesday and did not leave word where he could be reached. But a <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> was registered Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Sergel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, where the Soviets won the World Hockey Championships earlier this week. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> could not be immediately reached for comment. Soviet sources indicated in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> FLT </ORGANIZATION>, a Swedish news agency, that he was heading to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join an <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> team. Soviet athletes are playing in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in increasing numbers, with one of <PERSON> Moligny </PERSON>'s former teammates, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Priakin </PERSON>, joining the <ORGANIZATION> Calgary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flames </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> in March, and deals in the works to bring other top hockey players, basketball players and boxers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was unclear what effect the defection might have on relations between the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviets. Four Soviet teams are scheduled to tour the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> next season, and the <ORGANIZATION> Calgary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flames </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Capitals are to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in September. `` I ca n't answer for the Soviets. They have been known in the past to do things the way they choose,'' Flames general manager <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>. `` I hope our relationship is stronger than one hockey player.'' <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said he did not anticipate any demand for the return of <LOCATION> Priakin </LOCATION>. `` We have a contract with them for the next two years. I believe the Soviets have a reputation of being solid businessmen and will stick to their agreement,'' he said. <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> described <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> as `` the best young player in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He was voted the world's best junior player by <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> scouts in a poll organized by The Hockey News. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>, the coach of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>. `` This incident soured our joyful homecoming after winning the championships,'' <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> told the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. He said he believed <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> was lured by the promise of a big <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> contract. However, he described relations between the Soviet Sports Committee and the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> as stable. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet sports authorities had planned to discuss allowing other Soviet players to sign with <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> clubs after the team returned from the world championships. In reporting the defection, Soviet television said National Team officials and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> federation asked the Soviet Embassy to tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian embassies the `` consequences of this situation for the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> would be most serious.'' The owner of the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> hotel where the Soviet team stayed during the world championships contacted team officials by phone at the airport and said he had received an anonymous phone call informing him of the defection. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> team, served a 10-game suspension earlier this season after a fight in a Soviet league game against <ORGANIZATION> Spartak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION>. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that he also was penalized a month's salary. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, a junior army lieutenant, told the <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that he was not interested in a military career. `` I want to do something else with my life,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed today for improved relations between Roman Catholics and Moslems in this southern African nation, which is experiencing a surge in Islamic fundamentalism. `` What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual recognition of those things that we share in common,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops on the last full day of his nine-day African tour. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> repeated the statement he made to Moslems during his trip to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in 1985, saying that Christians and Moslems `` have badly understood each other'' and that `` God invites us to change our old practices. `` Both among Christians working for unity ... and among believers of different religions, there is no place for aggressive proselytism which disturbs and hurts, still less toward the use of unworthy methods,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. There are about 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Moslems in this nation of 8 million people. Anglicans, Protestants and animists make up most of the rest of the population. Since the early 1970s, Moslems have expanded their presence in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, building hundreds of mosques across the country, widely believed to have been financed by Saudi dollars. Antagonism between Moslems and Catholics arose in 1983 and 1984 when several churches in <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mangochi </LOCATION> and the cathedral in <LOCATION> Zomba </LOCATION> were set on fire by Moslem extremists. In August, several <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youths and an elderly religious teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> by Moslem fundamentalists, church officials said. Some Moslem leaders said they were upset that the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> during the period of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials say the spread of Islam is one of the church's main challenges in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` A big question is whether <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will be a Christian or Moslem continent 25 years from now,'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said today. `` The church can not compete with the billions of dollars that is financing Islam in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Earlier today, the pope celebrated Mass for more than 100,000 people gathered on the sloping meadow of <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION>'s Kwacha Park. In his homily, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> referred to AIDS for the second day in a row, urging his flock to treat the victims of the disease as `` we would treat Christ himself.'' According to health officials here, as many as 18 percent of newborn children are infected with the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said about 20 percent of prisoners and urban workers have the disease. The pope also referred to the 640,000 refugees who have fled to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> to escape a civil war in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, urging his audience to `` show love and kindness'' toward them. The ceremony was attended by <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s president-for-life, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamuzu </PERSON> <PERSON> Banda </PERSON>, who arrived in a Mercedes limousine surrounded by his troupe of women dancers and singers and sat on a stage decorated with two carved wooden lions. The pope came to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> after visits to <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, Reunion and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and returns to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Saturday night.

<HEAD>Scientists Develop Treatment For Longer-Lived Tomatoes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE,, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The study of an obscure wild Brazilian tomato has led scientists to the discovery of a treatment that doubles the keeping time of some commercially-grown tomatoes. The nation's $ 1 billion fresh-tomato industry could realize dramatic benefits from the new process, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a plant physiology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It gives shippers more time to get the fruit to market, it gives supermarkets a longer period of time to sell the fruit and it will provide consumers with a better-tasting tomato, particularly during the off-season,'' said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the project director. The <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> treatment process increases the shelf-life of vine-ripened tomatoes to 10 to 12 days, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, a research associate on the project. Currently, store-bought tomatoes begin spoiling after 4 to 5 days. The method involves increasing the level of a chemical compound, called 1,4 butanediamine, already found naturally in the tomato. The process is now being tested by a food company to determine whether it is viable on a large scale. `` We were studying a mutant tomato, looking for a compound to induce ripening, when we kind of came upon this,'' said Law. Researchers got the idea while studying the <LOCATION> Alcobaca </LOCATION> tomato, a non-edible variety that holds its ripeness for several weeks before spoiling. <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> plant scientist <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutschler </PERSON> found that once the tomato is picked, the ripening process slows drastically, said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. Scientists eventually learned that the delay in the <PERSON> Alcobaca </PERSON>'s ripening process was caused by an abundance of 1,4 butanediamine, one of a group of chemicals known as polyamines found in all living things They also found several other natural polyamines that worked to retard ripening. The <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> method calls for picking the fruit just after it begins to ripen on the vine and then infusing it with the polyamines. `` We simply double the level of polyamines already in the fruit, thus preventing the ripe fruit from becoming soft too quickly,'' said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. Most tomatoes available in stores during the off-season are picked while still green and are ripened with treatments of ethylene, a naturally occurring hormone, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` Green tomatoes never ripen properly and they never seem to taste like vine-ripened ones,'' said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>.

 New figures from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pushed the total of reported cases of AIDS around the world to more than 150,000 last month, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organisation </ORGANIZATION> said today. Updated reports received during April listed 5,191 new cases, nearly half of which were registered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency's latest monthly survey. A total of 151,790 cases have now been registered since WHO started keeping records in 1980. Twenty-eight of the 148 reporting countries say they have no victims. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, reported its first case. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the world's total, reported 2,845 new victims between the end of February and mid-April. This brought the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total up to 89,501 cases. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which ranks second only to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the number of reported cases, found 754 new sufferers in the first three months of the year, raising its total to 6,409 cases. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> registered 766 new cases for the first two months of 1989. With a reported total of 5,712 cases, the country has the highest number of cases in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> had the highest incidence rate in the American region, with 49.1 per 100,000 people, compared with 10.5 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> had the highest rate, 22.2.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is off to a surprisingly good start as president, according to an unlikely supporter _ <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done a fine job so far,'' the former president said Thursday. `` My only concern is that his administration respond more vigorously to the chance to negotiate with the Soviets on further arms control.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, participating in the state <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Power and the Presidency'' lecture series, told the audience of about 4,000 that every president must be `` competent, compassionate and always tell the truth'' and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems to exhibit more of these qualities than his predecessor, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> expressed similar sentiments at a meeting earlier Thursday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> with contributors to <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World Report. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done an extraordinarily good job in several areas, including <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the administration's plan for reducing the debt of foreign nations and its relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In a meeting with reporters in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> before his talk, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said it was clear that <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was not acting alone when he misled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. `` I do n't think there's any doubt about the fact President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew what was going on and gave either direct or indirect approval,'' he said. North was convicted Thursday on three of the 12 charges stemming from the scandal, including one that he destroyed documents as part of a cover-up. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he did n't think the verdict would have a significant effect on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. On another topic, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he was glad that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was moving away from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy of avoiding discussion of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Ignoring them does n't work,'' he said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> revealed that he once called <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security advisor, and threatened to publicly denounce the administration if it did not resume private briefings for the families of hostage members on news concerning their loved ones <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was scheduled to leave for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> today as part of an international delegation that will monitor elections there Sunday.

 Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said today that Palestinians should kill Americans and other Westerners in retaliation for attacks by the Israeli military in the occupied territories. `` If in retaliation for every Palestinian martyred in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> they will kill and execute, not inside Palestine, five Americans or Britons or Frenchmen, they -LRB- Israelis -RRB- could not continue these wrongs,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` It is not hard to kill Americans or Frenchman. It is a bit difficult to kill -LRB- Israelis -RRB-. But there are so many -LRB- Americans and Frenchman -RRB- everywhere in the world,'' he said. At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke at a prayer sermon today in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> before huge rallies to mark the Iranian holiday in support of the Palestinian cause. Television showed pictures of thousands of demonstrators. Excerpts of the speech also were carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` God knows there is a solution if you announce today that from now on you will threaten American interests throughout the world,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also encouraged Palestinians to hijack planes to force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to release prisoners and to blow up factories in Western countries. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for renouncing terrorism and recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. He also brushed aside Western reaction to his support for violence. `` Now they will start saying that so and so, as a man in charge, and as the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has officially called for acts of terror ... But let them say it ... are n't they saying it now?'' Soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, set aside May 5 as Quds Day, referring to the Arabic name for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He has called on Islamic nations to free <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Islam's third holiest city after <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule. `` Those who give $ 10 billion a year to preserve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and know what they are doing, is their blood worth anything?'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. His remarks appeared to be a further deepening of the Iranian campaign against the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, launched Feb. 14 by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> with a death sentence against British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for his book `` The Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> blasphemed Islam in the book and used his condemnation as a platform to attack slackening revolutionary zeal in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Western reaction to the death sentence, including 14 countries that called home their top envoys from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, led <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and other Iranian leaders to say ties with the West are unnecessary. Diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were severed. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was the leader of pragmatists seeking Western help to rebuild after the ruinous war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that ended in a cease-fire last year. But his recent pronouncements have been harsh toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, including his statement last month that a spy ring that included Iranian naval officers giving military and other secrets to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been broken.

 The robot probe <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> streaked across the solar system today at 25,000 mph on its way to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more routine tasks aboard Atlantis. Deployment of the probe from the shuttle's cargo bay Thursday night signaled a revival of an American planetary-science program that has been dormant since 1978. `` The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are operational and nominal. It could n't be better,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project manager, said a few hours after the probe was launched. Atlantis' fiery blastoff Thursday afternoon followed a cliff-hanging, 59-minute wait that ground controllers and the five astronauts endured because of the fickle <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> weather. With just five minutes left in the shuttle's launch window, controllers found a hole in the clouds and Atlantis thundered into the sky at 2:47 p.m. EDT. About six hours after the liftoff, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> was gently ejected from the shuttle's cargo bay and the $ 550-million interplanetary mission began. `` At last check, all systems were working exceptionally well on <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said early today. The space shuttle also was performing well, <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> said. Mission Control awoke the crew today at about 9:20 a.m. EDT with a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie `` Superman.'' `` Good-morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> told the crew. `` Good morning <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> replied. `` We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our toothbrushes. `` We thank you for that fine wake-up music,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. During the rest of the mission, the astronauts will try to photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals of indium by melting and then re-solidying the material. The crew members also will take other photographs of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as well as test various systems on the orbiter. Another planned project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to determine how an anti-motion sickness drug is absorbed by the body in zero gravity. Atlantis, in orbit 184 miles above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, is scheduled to land Monday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the rebirth of the planetary program,'' <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON> said. `` It's the beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for quite a few years.'' `` While it's too early to tell about the major portion of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said when told <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> had been launched on its journey. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> was the first planetary craft deployed from a space shuttle. The Magellan is moving at a rate of 25,000 mph, relative to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds. At its current rate, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> could get from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a minute and could fly coast-to-coast in about seven minutes. But it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, the cloud-shrouded planet that is 158 million miles away. The probe will loop 1 -LCB- times around the sun and travel 806 million miles before reaching its destination in August 1990. Once in orbit above <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to use its radar system to map up to 90 percent of the planet's surface. The high-resolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as small as a football field _ 10 times the clarity of any previous pictures of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, where the surface temperature is 900 degrees, has long intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the Earth but so different in many other ways. The sun rises in the west because <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> rotates the opposite direction of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, and its rotation is so slow that a day there lasts 243 Earth days. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, named for the 16th-century Portuguese explorer, needed to be launched by May 28 or it would have had to wait two years for <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> to again be in a favorable alignment. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had tried to launch Atlantis last Friday, but a flaw detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff. Engineers later found what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line, and both parts were replaced before Thursday's launch. Crew members on the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>'s mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar system exploration that has been dormant since 1978 when the Pioneer-Venus spacecraft was launched. In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe on its way to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for launch from a shuttle early next year, <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> is to orbit the sun in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.

 Four fraternity members have been charged in connection with the mock kidnapping of a student from a university classroom that a professor said looked terrifyingly real. One of the four, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennoyer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity, said today the charges were `` totally ridiculous.'' The student taken from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> classroom in December was a sorority member who was to be held until she could raise her weight in food to be distributed to the poor. The four students surrendered to police and were arraigned Thursday in <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on charges of assault with a device designed to be substantially similar in appearance to a firearm. All were released on personal recognizance. The felony charge carries a potential prison term of three to 10 years upon conviction. Professor <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said she brought the charges because the university's discipline against the four was too light. Court documents indicate they were placed on a year's probation by university officials in March. According to the court records, the four burst into a classroom Dec. 7 wearing bandanas and carrying replicas of Uzi submachine guns and a fake handgun. <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said the four were dressed like terrorists and she had no idea the incident was part of a fund-raiser. `` I said, ` Get out of this room. Get out of this classroom.' I was more or less in shock.'' She said one masked invader pointed the handgun at her and pulled the trigger as they left. The prank was inappropriate for the class, which explores the impact of death on behavior, <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said. About 40 students were watching a film on medical ethics at the time of the mock kidnapping, she said. `` A lot of students take that course because they recently experienced death,'' she said. `` It was a philanthropic event, and this is a miscarriage of justice,'' said <PERSON> Pennoyer </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. `` We did n't do a thing to her -LRB- <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> -RRB-. We came in and took a student who knew we were coming. It's totally ridiculous.'' Also charged were <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> DaSilva </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miga </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> may be `` a terrible place to live,'' but scientists believe the planet's torrid temperatures, incredible pressures and sulfuric acid rain may be a great place to learn about the solar system's evolution. A robot craft called <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space probe in 11 years, is on its way to survey <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> for clues to the forces that molded all the inner planets orbiting the sun. The $ 550 million craft will use a powerful radar imaging system to map <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' surface, where scientists believe the geologic history of the planet is imprinted. By studying that history, scientists hope to learn what's contained in the `` the missing chapters'' of solar system evolution. <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief scientist, said <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is known as the Earth's sister planet because it is about the same size as <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and close to the same distance from the sun, in astronomical terms. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, the second planet from the sun, is 67 million miles away, while <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the third planet, is 93 million miles out. Despite the similarities, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> `` has evolved into ... a substantially different object,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` It has an atmosphere that is 90 times that of the Earth. It has a runaway greenhouse effect. It has a surface temperature of 900 degrees. And it rains sulfuric acid,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` It would be a terrible place to live.'' The Earth and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, along with Mercury and Mars, are known as the `` inner planets'' because of their grouping nearer to the sun than the `` outer'' planets, such as Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> and Uranus. The family of inner planets are all thought to have accreted, or formed, 4.5 billion years ago. In the beginning, it's believed, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and Earth were near-twins in size and character. But while the Earth went on to become a lovely, gentle world thriving with life, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> became a hellhole _ so hot that lead melts on its surface. `` You've got to ask yourself why?'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` You've got to ask yourself if our own environment is that fragile? With only small changes, could Earth evolve into a different place?'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> may help answer some of those questions. The spacecraft is scheduled to slip into <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>' orbit in August 1990, and spend the following 243 days mapping the planet's surface with the most sophisticated radar ever sent to deep space. Radar signals are able to penetrate the dense cloud cover that conceals <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> from telescopes on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Radar views from <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> will be enhanced by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> computers to give clear pictures of powerful geologic forces at work on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. All the data could help experts ponder a fundamental question: Is the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, like <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, fated to one day become a barren, lifeless world backing in superheat and bathed by acids? Scientists expect to find thousands of volcanoes rising from the baked <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> plains. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> also has vast mountain ranges with peaks towering higher than the Earth's <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>. Most scientists believe the runaway greenhouse effect on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, caused by its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, long ago caused all water on the planet to boil away. The experts also will look for indications of continental drift, the force that causes rock plates to inch about the globe over millions of years. If there is evidence of volcanism and crustal drift on <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, it will prove that the planet retains enough internal heat to melt rock. The internal heat machine is what creates the lava for volcanoes and drives the movement of continents. Meteors crashing into the shallow surface crust of the planet are expected to have left craters in every sector of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said these scars will be of particular interest to experts. The age of a solid planet or moon, he said, can be calculated by the number and distribution of craters. `` Knowing whether <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is a fluke or just one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar system'' will help answer such questions, said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> also may help scientists deduce `` the probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _ somewhere else'' in the universe.

 Two West Germans reportedly abducted in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> reappeared early today, but a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla said kidnappers were holding a third in connection with the case of a Lebanese hijacker on trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There was no immmediate confirmation a third West German was being held, and West German television said the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> government was skeptical anyone was seized. `` We are still trying to find the facts,'' said West German Ambassador <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottelman </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said the two West German relief workers who reappeared `` disappeared for a certain period of time and then suddenly reappeared'' last year as well. The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia said in a statement that <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were released at 5 a.m., 10 hours after being abducted, and drove to their office between the Palestinian refugee camps of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hilweh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mieh </LOCATION>, near the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. A Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security at the base where the two work said the West Germans `` told me that the kidnappers are keeping their colleague <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> ... in connection with the case of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. `` There were three when they left yesterday evening. Only two of them returned today,'' said the Palestinian, 1st Lt. <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON>, who uses only one name. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is a Lebanese Shiite Moslem on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed. Neither <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, a 48-year-old administrator, nor Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, a 26-year-old nurse, would speak to reporters after their arrival in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. They hid their faces from photographers. The commander of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military police in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Wajih </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, said this was because they feared for their colleague. `` The released two told me they are scared because the kidnappers have threatened to kill their third colleague if they revealed any information about their abduction,'' said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON> did not say if any demands had been made. <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON> said he saw <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> leave in a car together Thursday. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said that based on his investigation, five gunmen in a car intercepted the relief workers' van on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> late Thursday, forced them into the car and `` sped away toward the south.'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were released in the <LOCATION> Zahrani </LOCATION> area, six miles south of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. He said they jumped into a taxi that drove them to their base. In <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, the two met for 10 minutes with <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, who heads the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which is dominant in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. After that they were whisked out to waiting cars. Reporters and photographers were not allowed into <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>'s residence to cover the meeting. Earlier, the militia's press officer, who identified himself only as <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON>, said his militia and the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia carried out `` nightlong efforts to locate the kidnap victims. This cooperation led to their quick release.'' The Syrian-backed Amal militia, led by <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, controls most of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> refused to identify the alleged kidnappers. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> said the government believes it `` peculiar'' that on April 6, 1988, the same two people disappeared under similar circumstances and reappeared a short time later. At that time, <PERSON> Steubig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were thought to have been kidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group for which they work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage. It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their disappearance apologized to the two after discovering their identities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area. `` The federal government obviously has doubts whether the two actually were victims of a kidnapping,'' <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said after <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, noted the 1988 incident. <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> also said the government had no information about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 25, arrived in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> eight days ago. He also works for Asma-Humanitas, which has six employees in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There are 15 foreigners held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

Both were eventually released. A pro-Iranian group, <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for the abductions and said the releases were a `` good will gesture'' to win a lenient sentence for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who faces life in prison. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of those kidnappings.

 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> today lost a parliamentary seat it has held for 38 years, suffering a sharp rebuff as she marked her 10th anniversary as prime minister. In a huge 12.5 percent swing against the government, the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured the <ORGANIZATION> Vale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glamorgan </ORGANIZATION>, a largely rural <LOCATION> Welsh </LOCATION> district, with a 6,028-vote majority. That overturned the Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority in 1987 general elections. `` This is what the new modern <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> can do ... Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s days are numbered,'' declared victor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who won a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> seat left vacant by the death of a lawmaker. Defeated Conservative <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> acknowledged votes were lost over Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s plans to overhaul property taxes and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and to sell off the national water and electricity utilities. `` We have to win that debate in the country and it will take time because we're changing something quite radically and people are naturally concerned as to how it will affect them,'' he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> retorted: `` My Conservative opponent had to defend the indefensible. This was a test of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 years in office and the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Vale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glamorgan </ORGANIZATION> made it absolutely clear that she's not wanted.'' Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> dismissed the result as a minor midterm setback. Labor also scored heavily off the two divided center parties, whose support collapsed. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> polled 23,342 votes to the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>' 17,314. The centrist Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took only 2,017 and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes. The election of the 38-year-old business studies lecturer shaved Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s majority in the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> to 101 _ still ample to assure passage of her ambitious reforms. The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 228, the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 19 and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 3. Minority regional parties hold the rest. It is only the fourth time in 25 years that Labor has snatched a seat from the Conservatives in a by-election. The centrist parties acknowledged they paid heavily for their split after the last general election in 1987, and the rivalries that have become known as `` the muddle in the middle.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who celebrated her 10th anniversary by declaring she had transformed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, faced more problems on the industrial front. She swept to power on a wave of anti-union sentiment May 4, 1979, after a winter of strikes in which garbage piled up across the country, hospitals turned away the sick and the dead were left unburied. But now, strikes over pay or conditions loom on the state railroad, in the docks, the engineering industry, the electricity supply service, the fire-fighting service, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway and among news staff at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal newspaper The Guardian predicted today <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is heading for its worst industrial strife since a yearlong coal miners' strike collapsed in 1985 Some Conservative legislators claim the unrest may be an organized campaign. `` This is beginning to look like a conspiracy,'' said Tory legislator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenway </PERSON>. The Institute of Directors, an employers' organization, meanwhile reported that confidence in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> economy among company directors has fallen the last two months. It said those listed as `` more optimistic'' dropped from 29 percent to 19 percent, while more than half said they were `` less optimistic.''

 The government is investigating trading practices of more than 50 dealers at four <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities markets in criminal and civil probes that follow a similar crackdown in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The criminal investigation at the sprawling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading pits at the World Trade Center reportedly focuses on a firm whose president was cited for regulatory violations in 1985. About 16 agents from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Inspection Service and the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday subpoenaed the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>; and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. No arrests were made or arrest warrants issued. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, a federal regulatory agency, is seeking information about trading practices by firms and individuals in a civil investigation, the exchanges said in statements. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office is leading another criminal probe that involved seizing documents from two offices of a single firm, which sources identified as <ORGANIZATION> MBF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The firm is run by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> member who paid $ 60,000 to settle trading practice violations with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspector <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said document searches authorized in two warrants were conducted `` at two different offices of the same individual'' _ rooms 992 and 9926 at 4 World Trade Center. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lists the address of <ORGANIZATION> MBF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> as room 992 of 4 World Trade Center. A building directory also lists the firms MBF Trading and Dollar Index Services as operating from the office. Traders said at least three silver futures traders from one company were called off the the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, while an independent trader was called from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. All the subpoenaed exchanges said they would cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which can bring civil charges. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> was not a target of the probe, officials said. Mercantile Exchange President <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> subpoenaed the exchange for information from the last two years on 20 present or former Nymex members. `` We do not know what the scope of their investigation is at the present time nor specifically what they are targeting in on,'' <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said it was ordered to produce documents on about 27 past and present exchange members by May 17, while six individual traders were subpoenaed directly. The Coffee, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said they were subpoenaed about an unspecified number of members. The exchanges trade commodities from oil to frozen orange juice. The commodities are bought and sold on a sprawling floor by traders shouting orders in chaotic pits, which are monitored by officials from the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and the individual exchanges. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and exchange officials will testify before the committee on May 17 at a hearing on floor trading practices at the nation's The agriculture committee oversees the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which is up for congressional reauthorization this year. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said the committee has been reviewing trading practices at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges since mid-January and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investigation would be addressed at the hearing. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> refused to comment on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> probe, but a source in his office who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. No indictments have been announced, but as many as 200 subpoenas reportedly have been issued to traders and firms at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today quoted unnamed government officials as saying the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> probe focused on a number of issues, including so-called tax trades. In such deals, which can be illegal, pre-arranged trades are executed to include false losses and defer income.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party in the republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> removed 22 party leaders in a sweep that gives greater strength to reformers, officials and Estonian reporters said today. The 22 dropped from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> included former party chief <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>. The party leaders were removed during a meeting Thursday of the 120-member Central Committee. The sweep strengthens newer party leaders who generally are more progressive and tend to support sovereignty for the tiny Baltic republic. <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>, who spoke at Thursday's meeting, accused some of the retiring members of involvement in the exile of tens of thousands of Estonians in the 1940s and 1950s, an Estonian reporter said. <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON> said several of the former <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members were `` big bosses who participated in the deportations,'' Estonian radio reporter <PERSON> Sulev </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallik </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s declining popularity was a factor in Thursday's action. A recent public opinion poll in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> found that more than 50 percent of residents support the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a grass-roots nationalist group, while only 7 percent back the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The Estonian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` must now take radical steps and quickly work out a program'' if it wants to hold its own among other political groups that are flourishing in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. The 22 were removed `` according to their own request'' in a move similar to the housecleaning last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that dropped 110 former officials from the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership, he said. `` They were, to a great degree, responsible for the sad position we're in now, so of course they should take the consequences for it,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for almost a decade, was replaced in June 1988 after months of criticism for inaction on pollution and corruption. His replacement, <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, is a reformer supported by the Popular Front. Yet he mildly criticized the group during Thursday's meeting for seeking to return <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to the past, before the Soviets occupied it in 1940, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> attacked several of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s newspapers for supporting the radical <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks Estonian secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnaste </PERSON>, a leader of that group. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Interdvizhenie </PERSON>, a largely Russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political reform.

 Officials at <LOCATION> Sea-Arama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marineworld </LOCATION> are mourning the sudden death of a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> black whale that arrived at the <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> marine park only a month ago. Although the precise cause of death has not been determined, an autopsy on the 13-foot whale revealed tumors throughout the carcass, <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, a caretaker at <LOCATION> Sea-Arama </LOCATION>, said Thursday. The whale, called Nami, was one of two such whales to arrive April 2. Caretakers were making regular checks on Wednesday when they noticed the whale was having difficulty swimming and breathing. Although trainers swam with the whale and tried to keep it breathing, it died within about 10 minutes. `` We were right there with her the whole time and we still do n't know what happened,'' Ms. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said `` It was just very emotional for all of us because it was so unexpected. She had shown no sign at all of being ill earlier in the day.'' The second whale, called <LOCATION> Tanoshi </LOCATION>, appears to be healthy, she says.

 A federal judge today ordered a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> representative to perform 200 hours of community service for conspiring to conceal illegal political contributions from defense contractors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> also gave <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 55, a suspended three-year prison sentence and two years' probation. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and to causing the filing of false <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> reports that concealed two $ 1,000 donations to former Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> admitted to a complicated scheme to funnel the contributions to <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s re-election campaign from companies that, along with <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, provided technical services to the Pentagon <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, who died last month, denied knowing that his campaign had received the illegal corporate donations. He was not charged in the case. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> told the judge that <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s cooperation with the `` Operation Ill-Wind'' probe of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud had `` resulted in the rapid movement of the investigation and has opened up other areas of investigation.'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s cooperation led to several other guilty pleas by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> officials. The company sells computer equipment and fire control devices to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensfield </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s two convictions were for charges that are `` usually prosecuted administratively by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We're not talking about bribes here.

The fraud investigation has resulted in several convictions of defense consultants and contractors charged with paying bribes to obtain inside information on Pentagon procurement plans. <PERSON> Bensfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> was `` carrying out the orders of his only boss in the corporation'' when he arranged to funnel the illegal campaign conributions to <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s re-election fund. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> told the judge, `` I made the mistake of trying to be a good soldier ...

 A controversial hymnal giving <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> a mix of gospel standards and more contemporary hymns drew rave reviews as the songbook made its formal debut at an international gathering of church leaders. `` I think they have a good blend of the old and the new,'' said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrismon </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. Her husband, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrismon </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said the inclusion of worship guides would aid churchgoers. `` It looks like the hymns are very singable,'' said <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollar </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` I like the fact that they dropped all those ` amens' at the end.'' At a `` service of thanksgiving and consecration'' Thursday night, an overflow crowd at <ORGANIZATION> Edenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> broke the paper seals around the updated hymnals, then sang a rousing rendition of `` O For a Thousand Tongues to Sing'' by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>, brother of Methodist founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON>. `` This is more than a collection of hymns; it is the book of worship for our denomination,'' Bishop <PERSON> Rueben </PERSON> <PERSON> Job </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hymnal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the congregation. The denomination's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1984 to update the hymnal and agreed on a final version last year, according to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. But what church leaders thought would be a quiet process erupted into spirited protests with the suggestion that `` Onward Christian Soldiers'' be eliminated because of its militaristic lyrics. The hymn, without modification, is in the new hymnal. `` Little did we realize when we started to do a hymnal that it would have any interest beyond the denomination,'' said <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON>, noting the national attention the debate has received. Among the new inclusions are <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>'s `` To God Be The Glory'' and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaither </PERSON>'s `` He Touched Me,'' <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the book's editor, has observed that people take their hymns very seriously and take their hymn books very personally,'' said <PERSON> McAnally </PERSON>. `` It's in their memory banks and they connect events in their lives, happy and unhappy, with hymns they have sung.'' Efforts to update hymns with more contemporary language and to make male metaphors more gender-inclusive also drew long debate, <PERSON> McAnnally </PERSON> said. For example, `` Good Christian Men Rejoice'' became `` Good Christian Friends Rejoice.'' In the <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> hymn `` Christ the Lord is Risen Today,'' the line `` sons of men and angels say'' now reads `` earth and heaven and chorus say.'' <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> was chosen for the hymnal's debut because it is the site of this week's Council of Bishops, a meeting of 100 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> bishops from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> was a credible witness and warm person, says one of the jurors who voted to convict the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide after days of deliberations often filled with `` bickering and arguing.'' But the juror, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 65, also seems torn over whether <PERSON> North </PERSON>, facing up to 10 years' imprisonment, should spend time behind bars. `` I believed him,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday after the jury found <PERSON> North </PERSON> guilty of three of 12 counts against him. `` No, I do n't think he should go to jail. Colonel North, I do n't know if he's all that bad or all that good. He made some mistakes.'' But interviewed today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> first equivocated and then appeared to change his mind. `` Do you think he should go to jail?'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was asked. `` Well, whether he should go to jail or not is not my, is not for me to say,'' he replied. Pressed for his opinion, however, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said: `` Well, personally, I feel that if he's guilty he should go to jail. Which he is, so, you know ...'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a former security guard who had served with Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>'s 3rd Army in World War II, said the jury did not agree on the guilty counts until Thursday, the 12th day of deliberations, although some of the acquittals had been decided earlier. The last charge to be decided was whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> altered and shredded government documents, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> resident said. He said the question was over whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> had criminal intent. North was also convicted of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and accepting an illegal gratuity. `` The jury was split a while on some of the counts, and in a case such as this there is a lot of bickering and arguing,'' he said. `` But with God's help we prayed a lot and made a decision.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the nine female jurors, `` were really set in their ways, but after prayer, a little consideration and friendly talking they came right in with us.'' But he did not say in what direction anyone had to be persuaded. Still, there were no dominant characters on the jury, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We were all pretty strong ... it was touch and go ... at one time this person might be a little strong and another time that person might be a little strong.'' Other jurors were too exhausted and ready to return to their families to say much about the deliberations. Calling the verdict the hardest decision she ever had to make, <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrish </PERSON>, a 39-year-old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> resident, said that `` I just want to be with my family.'' `` I'm going to take my shower and catch the next flight out of here to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>,'' said juror <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a 53-year-old cashier in the district. The husband of juror <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 37, a lab technician from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is hoping that life for the couple and their three children will be back to normal in a few days. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a mental health counselor, said his wife went into seclusion, but not before taking their three children out for seafood. `` I'm glad things will be back to normal,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said because, `` the kids missed her.''

 A U.N.-sponsored conference today called for financial aid, possibly including a new international fund, to help developing countries phase out chemicals that damage the earth's protective ozone shield. The compromise proposal for a world climate fund was adopted after private consultations among delegates of nine industrial and Third World countries. <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, head of the U.N. Environment Program, adjourned the meeting Thursday to break a deadlock whether to have such a fund. `` This is the decision in principle that I wanted,'' <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> told reporters. `` What remains is more difficult, to make it concrete. Industrial countries objected to demands to a fund that they said could be expensive to set up and administer. Third World countries wanted to ensure that assistance would not be drawn from existing aid programs. Earlier, the conference called for a worldwide ban by the year 2000 on chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are used in refrigeration, some plastics and insulation. CFCs break down the ozone layer high above the earth that filters out ultraviolet radiation from the sun, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye disease. The delegates agreed that developing countries needed assistance to replace the technologies and equipment they inherited from the industrial countries. Scientists said the threat of ozone depletion can be averted only if <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> emissions are stopped altogether. The adopted resolution said the conference `` recognizes the urgent need to establish international financial and other mechanisms'' to help developing countries. It set up an `` open-ended working group to develop modalities for such mechanisms ... that do not exclude the possibility of an international fund.'' The working group is to report next year to a second follow-up conference of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which was the first treaty to establish controls on the production and use of CFCs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation leader <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON> said she is satisfied with the funding resolution, which she said filled the `` obvious need for some financing on an international level. `` The paper is fine,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a good mood in the working group. After all, we're all in this together trying to do the same thing.'' <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s Environment Minister <PERSON> Kaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlund </PERSON>, who championed the idea of a world climate fund, said the resolution was `` close to what we wanted.'' But he acknowledged that the vague wording may make it difficult to get the fund working. The compromise was worked out among delegation heads from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tobago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>South African Minister Proposes Black Role In Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister said today the government wants to bring the black majority into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch, but only if the white minority can not be overruled. Security for the country's 5 million whites can be ensured `` only in an environment of progress, safety and justice for all the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said in a speech to Parliament. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs and no representation in Parliament or the Cabinet. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' speech was a relatively comprehensive summary of various proposals he and other government officials have mentioned in recent months. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said details of a new constitutional system would have to be negotiated, and thus he offered few specifics about the new role envisioned for blacks. Thus far, no prominent black leaders have accepted the government's invitation to participate in constitutional negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>' plans, while some moderate blacks have indicated they would negotiate if the government freed imprisoned black leaders such as <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and lifted bans on black opposition groups. Speculation the government may free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> after general elections on Sept. 6 increased today when <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was visited at a prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, a terminally ill colleague freed from jail in November. <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, who is suffering from a neurological disease, refused to say who initiated the meeting. Both men are 70 and have been members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the 1940s. Until <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>'s release, both were serving life sentences for involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement. Previous attempts to free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> have been blocked by the nationalist leader's refusal to renounce violence in the fight for majority rule. In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> rejected charges the government's proposals are vague and insincere `` Everyone has to become participants in legislative, executive and judicial institutions because fairness demands it, and also because this will ensure progress, safety and justice for the white man,'' he said. He said the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wants a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` in which the grievances of the past were dead and buried and in which all people could walk tall.'' Referring to policies which divide <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> by race, <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said the government remains committed `` to the protection of those groups wanting to be recognized as groups.'' But he indicated the government is willing to negotiate possible changes in laws mandating racial classification. Government policies `` implied that all the political entities'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> could have a role in electing a head of state, serving on the Cabinet and serving in Parliament. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seeks a system `` in which numbers would not play a decisive role.''

 The chief judge in the trial of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said today the proceedings will not be influenced by the reported kidnapping of West Germans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A Palestinian guerrilla officer in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said three West German relief workers were seized in connection with the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> case. He said two were freed today but that the third was still held. There was no confirmation of the report. `` It has already been said several times that the work of the court can not be influenced by such events,'' Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said in a brief telephone interview. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> in connection with the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 on June 14, 1985. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted taking part in the kidnapping but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Prosecutors have urged a murder conviction and life sentence, and the judge has said a verdict could come this month. Shortly after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest in January 1987, two West Germans were seized in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A pro-Iranian group, <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for the abductions and said their eventual releases were a `` goodwill gesture'' to win a lenient sentence for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of those kidnappings. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said he was not familiar with all the details of the latest incident in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which apparently began Thursday evening. The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were released at 5 a.m. today. 1st Lt. <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON>, a Palestinian guerrilla officer in charge of security at the base where the two work, said the West Germans `` told me that the kidnappers are keeping their colleague <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> ... in connection with the case of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>, said only that the trial `` could lead to a threat against Germans, that is clear. But everything else is pure speculation.'' He noted that <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> `` disappeared for a certain period of time and then suddenly reappeared'' in April 1988. He said the government had no information about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. His comments prompted the ARD television network to comment in its 1 p.m. newscast: `` The federal government obviously has doubts whether the two actually were victims of a kidnapping.'' <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> claimed the government believes it is `` peculiar'' that in 1988 the pair disappeared under similar circumstances and reappeared a short time later. In 1988, <PERSON> Steubig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were thought to have been kidnapped and held two days, but the humanitarian group for which they work, Asma-Humanitas, denied they were taken hostage. It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their disappearance apologized after discovering their identities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area. Another Foreign Ministry spokesman, <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>, said officials had warned Asma-Humanitas workers many times about the dangers of working in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There are 15 foreigners held hostage there, including nine Americans. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Outcome Of Genetic Tests To Determine If Man Is Missing Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A couple are anxiously awaiting the results of genetic tests to determine if a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man who claims he was abducted when he was a child is their son. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marjean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagans </PERSON>' 3-year-old son <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> wandered away from them at <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on June 11, 1968. Police speculated the boy had stumbled onto a nearby boat ramp or slipped into the ocean and drowned. No trace of the boy was found. Mrs. <PERSON> Hagans </PERSON>, however, said she never believed her son was dead and launched her own search. Four months ago, the couple contacted the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> and asked that the investigation be reopened. The state referred the case to <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who agreed `` as a courtesy basically to get the information on the national computer again.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, as a young police sergeant, had investigated the boy's disappearnce in 1968. Meanwhile, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, was pursuing his belief that he was abducted as a toddler and raised in isolation by a widow who lived in a camper somewhere near <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, La. He said he was abused and kept from attending school. <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON> said he ran away when he was 15 and supported himself by working odd jobs. He now runs an interior decorating business and has invested thousands of dollars trying to locate his family. At the same time the <PERSON> Hagans </PERSON> got the case of their son reopened in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, an associate of <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON> was checking with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities for records of disappearances similar to <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON>'s account An investigator who worked with <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON> saw similarities in his case and <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagans </PERSON>' disappearance and passed the information on to him. Mrs. <PERSON> Hagans </PERSON> said she was overwhelmed when she met <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON>. `` I want to smother him with love. I'm a mother and I guess I want to pile up all those years and just put them together,'' she said. But <PERSON> Bonnabel </PERSON> added about the genetics tests, being run by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>: `` We wo n't be sure for two to six weeks. We want to keep a low profile.''

 The parents of a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> student killed and mutilated by cultist drug smugglers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are starting a committee to lead a campaign to fight drug dealing and drug usage. `` There will be change only when the people demand it,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> told a group of about 600 people at a town meeting called by him and his wife, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON>. `` Drugs cross state lines,'' <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said. `` Drugs are a problem defeating our nation.'' Their committee is called Make A Reponsible Kommitment _ or MARK _ named after their son, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, who was abducted from a street in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, during a spring break trip. His mutilated body was found in a shallow grave on a ranch near <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, the victim of a drug smuggler cult that believed human sacrifice would protect their drug operation. `` We want to let everybody know there is a lot of outrage in this country against drugs,'' <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said. `` The only way to to that is to try to unite all the organizations _ churches, clubs, anybody.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON> said she hoped her son's death would serve as a rallying point. `` I think every parent, brother and sister see their brother, sister or son in <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>,'' she said. The group is calling for mandatory drug tests after auto accidents and arrests, mandatory three-year terms in drug rehabilitation and education for drug users and similar four-year terms for sellers, and 10-year work programs for second offenders.

<HEAD>Three Men Held For Questioning In Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three men were being held for questioning in the slaying of the two senior leaders of the independence movement in this French <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory, prosecutors said today. French Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said he would fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> to attend the funeral on Sunday of <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and his top assistant, <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> also said New Caledonian elections planned June 11 would be postponed because the traditional period of mourning would still be in progress. No new date was announced. Police say the two men were shot to death Thursday by <PERSON> Djubelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wea </PERSON>, a hard-line separatist who opposed Tjibaou's moderate policies. <PERSON> Wea </PERSON> was killed by <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s bodyguards after the attack, which occurred on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>. The prosecutor's office identified the three in custody as <LOCATION> Paoula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wea </LOCATION>, a nephew of <LOCATION> Wea </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Tangopi </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Fessen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuet </PERSON>. Authorities provided no details of their alleged involvement in the attack. <PERSON> Tangopi </PERSON> was wounded in the exchange of gunfire and was under police guard in the hospital at <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. The senior surviving leader of the front, <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, said today the group would stick to its commitment to participate in a `` peace process'' that began last year and is to culminate in a 1998 referendum on independence. `` The word of <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> will be respected, and we pledge to make sure that the process is followed to its conclusion,'' <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, a witness to the killings, said he thought at least five or six gunmen were involved. The group announced it was calling off ceremonies planned to mark the first anniversary of the May 5 assault by French military gendarmes on a cave where separatists were holding more than 20 other gendarmes hostage. The fighting left 19 of the hostage-takers and two gendarmes dead. Tjibaou, <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> to take part in the ceremonies when Thursday's attack occurred. Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the inhabitants of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a group of islands 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Most favor independence. European settlers and their descendants make up 37 percent, nearly all of whom want to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The rest of the people are Polynesians and Asians, also favorable to retaining the link to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> Melanesian </LOCATION> population is growing much faster than the others and is expected to be in the majority again early in the next century.

 <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> gave away hundreds of thousands of dollars during his lifetime, but left an estate worth only about $ 2,000, according to his attorney. `` It's not that he did n't take in a lot of money. It's just that he did n't keep it,'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefcourt </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, 52, who committed suicide April 12 in his apartment near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, named <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrenson </PERSON> as sole beneficiary in his will, which was filed Wednesday in Bucks County. Ms. <PERSON> Lawrenson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> had lived together for several years. The 1983 will was accompanied by a death certificate listing his full name as <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and his self-described occupation as `` Jewish Road Warrior.'' He left instructions in the will for Ms. <PERSON> Lawrenson </PERSON> to choose a final resting place for his ashes and said disposal `` shall be as inexpensive as possible.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> had several hundred dollars in the bank, a small retirement account and personal effects of an undetermined value, <PERSON> Lefcourt </PERSON> said. A $ 10,000 bank loan was covered by an insurance policy. The $ 2,000 figure `` is just an approximate value of his estate,'' <PERSON> Lefcourt </PERSON> said. `` I'm not sure if it's realistic.'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> gave away `` hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions'' he had earned through his books, magazine articles and speaking engagements, <PERSON> Lefcourt </PERSON> said. In 1970, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> received a check for about $ 40,000 after negotiating a movie contract for his book, `` Revolution for the Hell of it,'' and immediately signed the check over to the Black Panther bail fund, <PERSON> Lefcourt </PERSON> said. `` It did n't even go through his account.''

 A 60-year-old socialist woman could become <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prime minister, an event that would turn this conservative, male-dominated country on its ear <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, a veteran of 20 years in parliament, is chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party. She is pressing opposition's case now that the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is mired in scandal. The former law professor has not directly expressed an ambition to be prime minister, but she would probably have the first shot if the Liberal Democrats fail badly in a general election and the Socialists win more seats than the other smaller parties. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said April 25 that he will step down soon to take responsibility for a loss of public trust because of an influence-peddling scandal. His conservative party, in power since it was formed in 1955, has yet to decide on a successor, and many party leaders are ruled out because of their links to the scandal. The Liberal Democrats are expected to put forward a second-ranking figure as a sort of interim prime minister and try to regain the public's trust before a general election that would give the Socialists a chance to oust the long-governing party. `` This is a golden opportunity for opposition parties to take over the governing power from the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> told reporters this week. `` If we fail to take advantage of this situation, we may as well remain minority oppositionists eternally.'' The Liberal Democrats have ignored her calls to let the opposition form a minority government in the Diet, or parliament. So the only alternative for the Socialists is to prevent the ruling party from winning the next election for the lower house, where the Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats. A lower house election must be held by next summer, but before then the electorate will vote this summer for half the seats in the upper house, where the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold 143 of the 252 seats. Analysts question whether the opposition has much of a chance given its lack of unity. The opposition includes the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 85 lower house seats -RRB-, Buddhist-based Komeito -LRB- 56 seats -RRB-, Democratic Socialists -LRB- 29 seats -RRB-, Marxist-Leninist Commmunists -LRB- 27 seats -RRB- and a scattering of independents. But analysts agree that it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> and the Socialists, who have n't tasted power since a few months in the late 1940s. In 1986, Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> became the first woman to head a political party in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Her predecessor resigned over the Socialists' election defeat to the popular former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> is one of only 27 women against 737 men in both houses, and her voice often is heard at public events. She also appears on television shows, not only to debate politics but to take part in game programs. She is from <LOCATION> Kobe </LOCATION>, where her father was a doctor. She is a regular in the parliamentarians' annual singing contest, performing the Japanese version of `` My Way,'' and she claims expertise in pachinko, the equivalent of Western pinball generally associated with students and working class people. Analysts say Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, a former professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> Doshisha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, helped the Socialists dramatically improve their dry image of a blue-collar party heavily dependent on labor unions. Now the party has a wider range of support from women's organizations, most of which had primarily supported the Communists, as well as from environmental, civil rights and peace groups Among disagreements between opposition parties is defense. The Socialists call for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to become a neutral and unarmed nation by shifting the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty into more of a friendship treaty with no military provisions. The two middle-of-the-road parties, <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, insist the security treaty is indispensable.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled three South African diplomats today because of their country's reputed role in a plot to sell arms to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> extremists in exchange for British-made missile parts. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Undersecretary <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> summoned South African Ambassador <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Killen </PERSON> and told him the three must leave the country within a week. `` We noted their expression of regret,'' a statement quoted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Killen </PERSON>. `` However, the South African government should be under no illusions about the grave concern with which Her Majesty's government viewed the involvement by South African officials in this affair. `` Because of the gravity of this affair, Her Majesty's government has decided that the South African government should be requested to withdraw three members of the South African Embassy,'' the statement said The move came two weeks after authorities in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> arrested a South African diplomat, an American arms dealer and three members of an extreme <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> organization in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Northern Irelanders allegedly were handing over parts of a Blowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missile manufactured in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The British government expressed grave concern over allegations the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile parts. The South African, identified by French sources as <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, was released after he claimed diplomatic immunity. A week later, the French government expelled three South African officials implicated in the affair. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the three who were `` requested to withdraw'' are First Secretary for Information Jan H.P. Castelyn, Counselor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourie </PERSON>, and Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, who works for the defense attache's office. The statement contained no hint that they were involved in the alleged plot. During the 15-minute meeting, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` we had considered carefully the South African response,'' particularly a statement by Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s defense minister, to his country's Parliment on May 3. At that time, <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said an official inquiry into the affair had shown that Storm had acted without government approval. He said he regretted the embarrassment caused to the British, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> governments and would act to ensure it would not happen again. But he also acknowledged on April 24 that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sometimes uses `` unconventional methods'' to get around an international arms embargo against his country. The Irish government, which has no diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, delivered a formal protest to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> statement, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is under a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> arms embargo and pointed to `` the security situation in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> where the lives of innocent people are at risk.'' He also warned the South Africans that `` any retaliation would be entirely unjustified.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state. Protestant radicals are fighting the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> effort. The three Irishmen and one American, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON>, arrested with Storm were being held on gun-running and conspiracy charges. On April 25, federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, opened an inquiry into possible <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> connections into the affair, saying <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON> had an office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, security sources said one of the three arrested was a warrants officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a volunteer reserve force. As a non-commissioned officer, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, 42, was thought to have instructed Territorial Army officers in the use of the Blowpipe. The other Protestants were not named.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> today told 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> delegates vying for election that prospects for improving the economy are limited but `` we can not and we do not give up.'' Opening the last day of a two-day conference to choose candidates and adopt a platform for new, partially democratic elections June 4, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> urged a realistic, rather than a pessimistic, outlook on the economy. `` I do n't want to prove to anybody that it is good in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. I only want to disagree with the spreading opinion that there is not only stagnation but also a constant decline,'' he said. In its first competition with independent candidates, the party wants to present itself as champion of economic and political reforms. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> blamed part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems _ which include acute shortages of housing, consumer goods and commodities _ on the rapid population growth from 35.7 million in 1980 to 37.8 million last year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who last month announced a package of economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, will visit <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in the first half of July at the invitation of Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the official news service announced today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave the aid in recognition of the restoration of legal status to the independent Solidarity trade union and the scheduling of the June elections. The exact date for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit was not announced in the one-sentence dispatch by the state's <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news service. At a news conference later today, party spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bysztyga </PERSON> said the party will not announce its candidates until May 10. Opposition candidates nominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already have been chosen Also today, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic Primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, met privately for the first time in nearly two years to discuss `` what's going on in the country,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> refused to discuss details. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he thanked the church for helping Solidarity survive during seven years as a banned organization. The church helped set up the talks between the government and the opposition that concluded April 5 with a historic package of political, union and economic freedoms, including legalizing Solidarity. Under the agreement, the opposition will vie for 161 seats, or 35 percent of the existing unicameral parliament called the Sejm. Elections will be totally democratic for a new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that will be the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first freely elected parliament chamber. The two houses will elect the president, a new office. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is expected to win owing to the party's guaranteed majority.

<TEXT>
 Blasting prosecutors and vowing to `` fight hard, for as long as it takes,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> says his conviction on three felonies in the Iran-Contra affair will eventually be overturned. The first person to go on trial in the scandal that rocked the last two years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> North </PERSON> lost his $ 23,100-a-year Marine pension as soon as the jury delivered its verdict Thursday. Ex-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who successfully resisted a defense subpoena to testify at the trial, declined to comment after the man he once called a national hero was found guilty. North was acquitted of nine of the 12 criminal charges against him and prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> appeared less than satisfied with the decision. Still, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said, `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> has been convicted of three very serious charges. The jury has spoken.'' North called it `` a partial vindication.'' North, to be sentenced June 23 by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and $ 750,000 in fines. As a first-time offender with an exemplary 20-year military career, <PERSON> North </PERSON> almost certainly will get penalties far less severe than that. Court appeals could take years. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s former `` action officer'' on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> counterattacked less than two hours after walking out of the federal courthouse. He defiantly criticized the cost of pursuing him through the legal system and suggested the prosecution had overstepped the bounds of fairness. `` After more than two and a half years and over $ 40 million of our taxpayers' money spent on investigations, congressional inquisitions and now a special prosecutor who has likened me to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, we now face many months and perhaps years of fighting the remaining charges,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, reading from a statement. `` As a Marine, I was taught to fight and fight hard, for as long as it takes to prevail,'' he added. `` We will continue this battle and with the support and prayers of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, we will be fully vindicated.'' In closing arguments last month, <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his former boss, national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, `` are following <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s old strategy: The victor will never be asked if he told the truth.'' North got an endorsement of sorts from one of the jurors, 65-year-old <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who served in <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>'s 3rd Army in World War II. `` He made some mistakes, you know, but I do n't think he should go to jail for it ... a hero like he was,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> following deliberations that totaled 64 hours over 12 days. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had an apparent change of heart overnight, however. In an interview today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' he said of North: `` Well, personally, I feel that if he's guilty he should go to jail. Which he is, so, you know ...'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> wo n't get his military pension back unless his conviction for altering and shredding sensitive <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> documents is overturned on appeal. `` Once the conviction goes into effect, whatever time that is, he loses his retired pay,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumoulin </PERSON>. The conviction is legally effective as soon as the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is formally notified and the paperwork completed. For North, intensely proud of his <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> career, the pain of that punishment is likely to be more in its symbolism than its financial cost. Conservative groups have been willing to pay him as much as $ 20,000 in speaking fees for a single appearance, and just a few hours after his conviction, two more speaking engagements were announced in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> for May 11. In seeking to overturn the convictions, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers will first file post-trial motions with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on the question of whether <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s case was tainted by his and other witnesses' nationally televised immunized congressional testimony in 1987 That could mean delving further into the knowledge of jurors, the grand jurors who indicted North and prosecutors in the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> set a deadline of 10 days for the defense to announce its intentions. North was found innocent of charges that focused on lying and obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assisting the Contras. At the time his superiors had passed along an order from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to see to the needs of the rebels, and to do so secretly during a congressional ban on military aid, according to trial testimony. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as shredding and altering documents in November 1986, crimes that occurred after the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales had been publicly disclosed. North also was found guilty of accepting a $ 13,800 home security system in mid-1986 from Iran-Contra co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> North </PERSON> had enlisted to run arms to the Contras. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the occasion of the verdict to speak out on a major question raised by evidence in the trial _ whether as vice president he helped circumvent the ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who previously had declined to comment because of the ongoing trial proceedings, declared Thursday that he never told <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' president that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid would be linked to that country's support for the Nicaraguan rebels <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared firmly that there was no deal, `` no quid pro quo.'' Some conservatives, meanwhile, clamored for a presidential pardon of North. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, declared that `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> deserves a medal, not a prison sentence.'' But on Capitol Hill, conservative Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, opposed a pardon, saying, `` The man was indicted and the jury decided that the facts upheld three of the indictments. It's obviously a tragedy for him and his family But no one is above the law.''

 Syrian and Druse gunners shelled the coast of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave today, and sources said there was a new dispute on how to enforce a cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers said Kuwaiti army Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Momen </PERSON> had been appointed commander of a 321-man observer force drawn from six <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations to monitor the fraying truce. Intermittent shellfire struck the shoreline between the ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, keeping the only escape routes closed for 1 million Christians in the beleaguered enclave, police said. Mortar salvos also were lobbed from positions around Syrian-policed Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> into the residential districts of <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON> in the city's Christian sector, police said. They said the mostly Christian units of the army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has pledged to respect the cease-fire proclaimed one week ago, did not return fire. There were no casualties reported from the new hostilities in the latest round of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The violence has killed 278 people and wounded 1,010 since March 8. Two <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoys _ <LOCATION> Lakhdar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ibrahimi </LOCATION>, an Algerian, and <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Jassem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambasssador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> _ left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Thursday after two days of talks with Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders to consolidate the cease-fire. They said they would return late next week to work out arrangements for deploying an Arab observer force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But chances of an early deployment of the force appeared dim. Moslem sources, requesting anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Syrian-Druse </LOCATION> alliance served notice it would not stop shelling Christian ports before the force arrived. The sources said the alliance also has demanded the force block ships carrying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> arms supplies to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from reaching the Christian enclave. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival. It expressed support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> when he declared his `` war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has denied receiving weapons from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` We're going to have a half truce,'' said the independent <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily An-Nahar. The current confrontation broke out two days after <PERSON> Auon </PERSON> imposed a blockade on illegal militia-run ports. Militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave's shoreline. The Syrians later joined the bombardment and sealed off land exits of the 310-square-mile enclave.

 Student demonstrators in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ended 11 days of protests today and calm was restored at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, where 102 protesters have been arrested in the past two weeks. Police on Thursday used wheelchairs to arrest 32 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> students after a 20-hour occupation of a dean's office in a science building to protest Defense Department-funded research at the 25,000-student campus. Three more students were taken into custody outside, including two who allegedly tried to block buses carrying protesters to the football stadium. The arrests brought the two-week total at the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus to 102. At the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, students who had occupied buildings on several campuses accepted an amnesty offer and ended their protests this morning, although demonstrations at two colleges lingered. `` I think it's over,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CUNY </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON>. The protests over proposed tuition increases and budget cuts began 11 days ago and spread to several campuses of the state-run university system. Elsewhere, teaching and research assistants at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> ended a two-day strike on Thursday, claiming they had won overwhelming support from students. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a group hoping to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Mercer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> trustees to keep open the school's <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> ended a 24-hour `` read-in'' Thursday and launched a daylong prayer vigil. Trustees voted to close the college June 30, 1990. In <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, several hundred students protested tuition increases at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, but the school's president said the demonstration was unlikely to stop plans to increase tuition to $ 19,000 a year, from $ 17,000 this year. Students carried placards and chanted slogans on Thursday to protest the increase, which includes tuition, room and board. `` This is not just a <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> problem,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON>, a junior and one of the protest organizers. He said students at other private schools are facing average 7 percent increases. Students at the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> chanted `` Money for tuition, not ammunition,'' and demanded the university halt its nearly $ 12 million worth of unclassified research for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Shortly before noon, campus police used wheelchairs to wheel the protesters out of a suite of offices belonging to <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON>, vice chancellor of research and dean of the graduate school. The students, including some from nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, were carried to a bus surrounded by more than 100 state, local and campus police in riot gear and about 200 cheering students. The 35 people arrested were taken to locker rooms at the football stadium for booking and arraignment on trespassing and other charges. The 20-hour takeover was the third occupation in two weeks on the 25,000-student campus. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CUNY </ORGANIZATION> Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said college presidents agreed not to punish demonstrators provided `` they had not been involved in the destruction of property or in causing injury to others.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students said they were happy with the amnesty offer and with the formation of a committee of students, faculty, administration and staff that would advise the president on budget matters. More than 100 students at Hunter vacated three floors of a building this morning, expressing satisfaction with an agreement reached during the early-morning hours with President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON>. `` This struggle is not over,'' said student spokeswoman <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. `` We won a major battle in stopping the tuition raise, but there are still many cuts in the budget to be regained.'' Students left the president's offices at <ORGANIZATION> Medgar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Rodin </LOCATION>. Protesters were planning to leave buildings this afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Borough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, she said. The demonstrations began April 24 when a group of students occupied a building at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> to protest threatened $ 200-a-year tuition increases and staff and faculty reductions because of state budget cuts. The protests and sit-ins quickly spread to seven of the 20 campuses in the system. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> vetoed tuition hikes earlier this week but did not boost funding, and school officials warn as many as 350 positions could be cut. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> said 70 percent of 410 classes were canceled because of the strike by nearly all of the 3,200 teaching and research assistants; 18 percent were less than half full and only 12 percent had normal attendance, according to the survey. The results were similar to those reported by the association Wednesday, when the strike began with the aim of gaining national attention for a burgeoning movement on the country's campuses _ recognition of assistants as employees. University officials, however, said the effort was mostly symbolic.

 Top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had highly reliable intelligence throughout 1986 about the exorbitant prices <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> were charging for arms sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to a document released today as the result of a lawsuit filed by 10 news organizations. The newly declassified three-page stipulation summarizing the intelligence was released in censored form under an agreement reached between the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> along with nine other news organizations. `` The intelligence ... provides information regarding the pricing and delivery of missiles and military material sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the release of American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' says the stipulation. Still-classified reports on the intelligence were gathered by `` various methods of surveillance'' and `` show individuals involved, including General <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>,'' the stipulation adds. `` The reports contained information about pricing of this material and those recipients of the reports at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> who knew the actual cost of this material to the <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> could have known the Iranians were being significantly overcharged.'' North enlisted <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras and also had the former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general turned businessman assist arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. North and <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> diverted profits from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales into bank accounts controlled by <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and some of the diverted money was funneled to the Contras for their fight to oust the Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The intelligence reports on which the stipulation is based `` generally range from two to several pages and are in chronological order commencing on September 1985 and ending in December 1986,'' the newly released document says. The intelligence reports were sent to 17 people, the stipulation says, including Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and national security advisers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The news organizations went to court April 21 seeking disclosure of the stipulation, which was given to the North jury during deliberations, but not released to the public. The stipulation underscores testimony at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial that top administration officials were given information about the prices of weapons being sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> testified that in computing a mark-up on one proposed shipment in the spring of 1986, he multiplied the cost of military spare parts by a factor of 3.7. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> was an aide to North on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had insisted that the uncensored version of the stipulation submitted to the North jury be kept out of the public record. The highly secretive agency gathers intelligence through a worldwide communications network. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected the news media's motion to release the stipulation, saying the document was classified Today, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> signed an order authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to release the censored version. The sanitized version of the stipulation `` deletes solely information that would disclose methods of intelligence collection,'' according to a joint court filing by lawyers for the news organizations and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The deleted information also includes data `` as to the precise time at which information was received.'' `` It does not delete the names or titles of any government officials who received the information and whose names already have been released in the public record,'' said the court filing. North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in closing arguments at his trial to show that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> knew that Hawk missiles were aboard a November 1985 shipment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. North was found guilty Thursday of aiding and abetting the preparation of a false chronology for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stating that no one in the government knew until January 1986 that Hawk missiles were aboard the November 1985 shipment. The conviction also covers shredding of documents in connection with the chronology. North's defense on the charge was that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> knew at the time what was in the shipment, but arranged to cover up that fact from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The other media organizations involved were <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders responded to massive pro-democracy student demonstrations with conciliatory speeches acknowledging protesters' grievances and promising further dialogue, state media reported Friday. Exhausted university students began returning to classrooms Friday after staging several marches during a two-week school boycott, and campus activists plotted their next steps for the fledgling democracy movement. Official newspapers prominently displayed a speech by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> that he delivered Thursday, when tens of thousands of students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to demand freedom and honest government. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> called for talks with the students, although he did not promise any meetings with representatives of the pro-democracy movement. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, in a speech Friday, also said `` the dialogue between the government and the students will continue.'' He did not elaborate. While <PERSON> Li </PERSON> expressed disapproval of `` some actions of some students,'' he said many of their demands were in line with government aims, such as bringing an end to corruption, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said the protesters `` absolutely do n't want to oppose our basic system, but demand that we fix maladies in our work.'' He also seemed to tone down earlier official claims that students were being manipulated by people and wanted to see the country in turmoil. He said such people were unavoidable but few in number and said vigilance against them must be maintained. `` I think the vast majority of students understand this.'' One student leader at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged the softening of the authorities' attitude, but claimed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was taking a page from traditional Chinese shadow boxing by `` turning flexibility into strength.'' The state media Friday also gave their fullest accounts yet of any student protest since the pro-democracy movement began April 15. Several newspapers quoted onlookers as saying they supported the marchers. They used stories filed by their reporters instead of <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, which has provided only skimpy and understated coverage of the student movement. Press freedom has been a major demand pushed by the students, and among the demonstrators Thursday were scores of journalists who voiced support for a media free from official control. After a nearly two-week boycott by students at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities, students returned to class Friday. Others, weary from successive marches, said they would wait until next week. A poster put up by the new student union at <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Our efforts of half a month or not wasted. Our class boycott had definite results. Returning to class does not mean we have ceased our diligence for democracy and for a dialogue'' with the government. The union said it chose to end the boycott `` to seek a form of dialogue that is reasonable and practicle and acceptable to both sides.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> reported more than half the capital's university students returned to class Friday. Opposition to ending the boycott surfaced at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where activists hesitated to order students back to class and a few wall posters appeared urging the strike to continue. `` I think we should boycott a while longer,'' said an economics student. `` If we go back to class now then there's no pressure on the government and it wo n't recognize our independent union.'' But there were indications democracy movement leaders were turning to new activities in their young campaign. At <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the new student group put up a poster requesting the return of bullhorns issued for the demonstrations Hard at work in a fourth-floor <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Normal dormitory room was a student activist reviewing possible new directions for the movement to take such as setting up an independent newspaper, forming `` culture circles'' to hear prominent speakers, conducting surveys and studying the Chinese constitution. `` We still have plenty of work to do,'' he said. The student movement began after the death April 15 of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, a reformer who lost his job as party chairman in 1987 when he failed to suppress pro-democracy student demonstrations. About 100,000 people, mostly students, occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Thursday after a march through the capital's streets to mark the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement and give momentum to the current wave of pro-democracy activity. Students participating in that protest and a similar demonstration a week earlier were eagerly supported by tens of thousands of workers who cheered the marchers and donated money to the cause.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not discussed the question of whether to pardon <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said today, a day after the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide was convicted on felony counts in connection with the Iran-Contra case. `` He said ` I have n't discussed it with anybody,''' White House press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters, recounting the president's reply when <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> asked him about a pardon on Thursday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused any further comment on the North verdict or trial documents that appeared to indicate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was involved in a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to make a quid pro quo arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for its assistance to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the appropriate congressional committees would be briefed on confidential cables that described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s activities in that regard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he never told <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' president that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid would be linked to that country's support for the Nicaraguan rebels. And he dared skeptics to prove him wrong. Confronting a pivotal Iran-Contra question head-on Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared firmly there was no deal, `` no quid pro quo.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had refused to address the issue for weeks, did so moments before a federal jury announced it had convicted former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on three of 12 charges relating to the arms-and-money affair. The president cited the ongoing North trial recently in refusing to talk about suggestions he played an intermediary's role as vice president in a purported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to tie <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance to the willingness of Latin American countries to help the Contras. But on Thursday he was eager to take the question. Speaking of a meeting he had with then-Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> in early 1985, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` The records of the meeting demonstrate there was no quid pro quo. `` The word of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ is, there was no quid pro quo. No implication, no quid pro quo, direct or indirect, from me to the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> on that visit. `` And for those who suggest there was, the onus is on them. ... Thank you for asking that question.'' Neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides would say whether he might grant North a pardon. Nor would the White House comment on the verdict. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on April 24 that he had not talked with anyone about whether he would pardon <PERSON> North </PERSON> and said any suggestions about what he would do were `` stupid'' and `` idiotic.'' In the past, he had called North a hero and said he hoped the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer would be acquitted. The question of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in a possible <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration deal with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was raised in documents presented at the North trial. The documents placed him at a meeting with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> at a time when internal <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration memos suggested a plan in which continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Latin American countries would be linked to assistance for the rebels. The government `` admitted for purposes of this trial'' the facts in a main document, the 42-page stipulation introduced at the trial, although a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official subsquently said it presented a distorted picture of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and actions in 1985 and 1986. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was barred from directly or indirectly aiding the rebels during that time. The document never asserted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed a quid pro quo arrangement with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. But it said he explained to the Hondurans that they were to receive a great deal more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and other aid _ aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained that `` there has been much needless, mindless speculation about my word of honor. And I've answered it now, definitively.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said last week that he had had no discussions with anyone about a possible pardon for North. On Thursday, deputy press secretary <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said only, `` We wo n't have any comment'' on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s conviction. Last year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called North a `` national hero'' but later refined that to say he was alluding to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s record of heroism in military combat. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the aftermath of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> trial, he would `` insist that the congressional committees ... be briefed thoroughly on the confidential cables'' describing the meeting with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. White House press secretary <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to have members of congressional committees briefed by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials regarding any questions they might have about the <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> meeting. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not submit to questions from lawmakers, although he reiterated that the White House position is to `` help in any way we can.''

 The state has approved a privately funded historical marker to be erected near the site of the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers whose deaths were depicted in the movie `` Mississippi Burning.'' <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, program director at WKXI-AM, a black-oriented station in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, launched efforts in February to raise money for the marker. The station so far has raised about $ 1,000. <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> and History, confirmed in a letter received by the station Friday that the marker had been approved, but he said no decision had been made on the location. The ideal spot would be along a state highway, <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the marker may be located along <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> 21 near the earthen dam where the bodies of the three men were found. Archives officials have said that no state historical marker was erected because public money has not been appropriated for such markers since 1980. <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> had said that private groups may purchase state historical markers for $ 925, but the department must approve the marker and the text on them. `` It is certainly fitting that historic sites in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> can be designated with appropriate markers so that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s citizens and out-of-state visitors can study and enjoy the interesting heritage of our state,'' <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> said in his letter to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> began his fund-raising drive about the time `` Mississippi Burning'' was first shown in the state. The movie is a fictionalized account of the federal investigation of the murders of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1964.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> today discussed by telephone the rift in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on short-range missiles, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains firmly opposed to such talks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the phone conversation, initiated by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, lasted for about 20 minutes. He declined to characterize the substance of the conversation, but said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not changed his opposition to early talks with the Soviets on eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We still believe early talks would be a mistake,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Discussions that would lead to a ... de-nuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would not be welcome.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, responding to public opinion in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> where the presence of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear weapons is being strongly challenged, has called for such talks with the Soviets. The issue threatens to disrupt a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit late this month. `` I want the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting to be a success,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` And one way you guarantee success is not to go out and fine-tune nuance differences that may exist between various staunch allies.'' Today, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> accused the Soviets of `` assiduously'' seeking to drive a wedge among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies over elimination of the short-range missiles. He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> called because `` he wanted to be sure he understood President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position.'' Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were any closer to smoothing over their differences on the issue as a result of the phone call between the two leaders, the spokesman said: `` I would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or the other.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had voiced the administration's willingness to negotiate with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on the dispute. But, he added, `` we're not going to go for any third zero -LRB- the elimination of the short-range weapons -RRB- or getting SNF -LRB- another term for the weapons -RRB- out of whack in terms of negotiations. So let's get clear on that.'' Asked today at what point the president might be willing to enter into such negotiations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> replied: `` It's impossible to define that point.'' Instead of curbing nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should put its emphasis on trying to get the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce its overwhelming superiority in conventional weapons. Resolving the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute should be done privately among members of the 16-member alliance, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The disagreement has clouded an upcoming May 29-30 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit called to celebrate the alliance's 40th anniversary. Referring to his guest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for giving him `` constructive suggestions'' on the matter. The Canadian leader did not detail those suggestions, other to say he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was founded on two concepts: first, solidarity; and secondly, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership of the Western alliance. And we have to stick together on all of these fundamental issues. And we will.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has suggested a compromise in which <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would agree in principle to talks with the Soviets on abolishing the short-range nuclear weapons while talks to erase the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's edge in conventional weapons proceed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had made some proposals to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and `` I expect we'll be hearing from them soon.'' White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not referring to any new proposal to deal with the problem posed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s demands. Instead, he was referring to a months-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for an overall approach for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s defense, the officials said. On other matters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration is in the final stages of work on new clean-air legislation that will propose tougher standards on industrial emissions that cause acid rain _ a crucial issue in U.S.-Canadian relations. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said, `` I applaud the leadership the president is giving to the environment, particularly to the question of acid rain.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he will meet `` in the next few days'' with his science adviser, physicist <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromley </PERSON>, about claims by scientists that they have produced nuclear fusion at room temperature. And he voiced `` enthusiastic backing'' to demands by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who have staged huge pro-democracy demonstrations.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Changes in Way FBI Promotes Minority Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge today ordered changes in the way the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> promotes its minority agents, calling the present promotional method `` unsystematic and excessively subjective.'' The order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> stops the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> from arbitrarily deciding whom to promote. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> called the bureau's system, under which supervisors may disregard the recommendation of a career review board, an `` anathema to nearly every reform advanced by the bureau.'' He ordered the agency `` to improve the fairness and reviewability'' of its promotional process. Last September, following a two-week, non-jury trial, <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> had ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had discriminated against Hispanic agents in promotions, discipline and assignments. It was a major embarrassment for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which investigates civil rights violations. In February and March, <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> heard arguments from both sides on how the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should change and whether Hispanic agents should be compensated. Hispanic agents had asked for back pay, but <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> declined to order any monetary damages in today's ruling. However, he ordered the appointment of a three-member panel to examine on an individual basis the plaintiff agents' request for promotions they claim they have been denied as a result of discrimination. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ordered that original plaintiff <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` Mat'' Perez be promoted to the next job level in the bureau within 45 days and that the bureau must `` make available to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> responsibilities commensurate with his experience and training.'' Also, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> must report to the court every 90 days regarding promotional decisions about <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> until he becomes a special agent in charge or attains a similar position of responsibility. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> praised the efforts made by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> since his initial ruling in September. `` The bureau has taken significant steps since the date of the trial to correct the disparate conditions of employment,'' <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> said in the opinion. But he stressed that reforms made thus far do not go far enough. Officials have said <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s decision could have a ripple effect on how other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies award promotions and hand out assignments. Hispanic agents of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> have discussed filing suits similar to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> case. The class-action lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, then the No. 2 agent in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-ranking Hispanic agent. Eventually, 310 of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 400 Hispanic agents joined <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in the suit. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has about 9,000 agents.

<HEAD>Newspapers Give Wide Coverage to Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracks appeared Friday in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s tightly controlled media as newspapers gave unprecedented and even sympathetic coverage to a huge student demonstration for democracy and freedom. The development was significant because one of the main student demands has been for a free press. Marches in the last three weeks had received scant attention by the state-run media. About 300 journalists also joined Thursday's march of thousands, adding their voice to the growing call for a freer and more democratic <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Our mouths can not say what we want to,'' read one of their banners. Still, it was uncertain whether Friday's reporting on the march would filter into other areas, such as corruption, mismanagement and the incompetence of bureaucrats. Major newspapers used stories from their own journalists, a change from the protest of April 27 when 150,000 students and their supporters also marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. The next day all of the papers used a report from the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most conservative media outlet Unlike previous reports, several newspapers quoted bystanders as saying they supported the march. The Science and Technology Daily quoted an old woman with tears coming down her face as saying the students were speaking on behalf of the people. The quote was an important one because in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to speak for the people. The article also used quotes to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report which said only 20,000 students from 30 schools took part in the march. `` More than 100,000 must be here,'' one person told the newspaper. `` There must be more than 70 schools,'' said another. Science and Technology, a paper for intellectuals, has been at the forefront of reporting about the movement. But it has n't been easy. Its April 23 edition, devoted to a demonstration during which tens of thousands of students spent the night at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, came out only after its reporters threatened to quit. Ultimately, they had to deliver the paper themselves. Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> story did n't include veiled criticism of the movement. The report also mentioned the protest put on by 300 journalists, saying simply that `` more than 200 young reporters also demonstrated.'' The People's Daily implicitly acknowledged the widespread public support for the marchers, saying `` Tens of thousands of onlookers stood by and many of them actively donated drinks and food.'' The paper also reported that after the protesters left <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> some passed by its offices where they `` yelled slogans.'' The paper, the organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has been subject to heavy criticism by the students because it published an editorial April 26, accusing them of trying to overthrow the state. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a relatively liberal paper, praised the students for conducting an orderly march. It reported a large group of students `` are not satisfied'' with talks held between the government and the students. However, the article did not explain that students want the government to conduct talks with their independent student association and not with officially-appointed student representatives. It also said protests occurred in at least 11 other cities. The Legal Daily reported that one protest, in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, was actually legal. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> had applied for permission to demonstrate on May 4, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first student movement, and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> had agreed. The Chinese constitution guarantees the right to demonstrate but most cities have laws saying demonstrators must apply for a permit. Technically, all of the protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been illegal because students did not apply for permits. A senior editor at one major newspaper said the reports Friday came out because of the pressure many journalists put on their newspapers to publish. `` But behind this there is no move to change the structure of the media in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. We are still owned and run by the state,'' she said. `` Until that changes, I see no possibility for real progress.''

<TEXT>
 The government said Friday it had advance warning that Moslem guerrillas would attack <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which the insurgents predicted would fall in days but instead has been under bloody siege for two months. Estimates of total casualties range from 7,000 to more than 12,500. <PERSON> Najmuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> and secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the government received a tip about the offensive on March 5, two days before it began. He did not say who gave the warning. `` No one could believe they were to launch an attack,'' <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said in an interview. The guerrillas, armed and supported by neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, predicted they would capture the eastern city within three days. <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said Friday they `` were enslaved by their own slogans.'' Guerrilla leader <PERSON> Gulbuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> has said he would pray in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> at the close of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the Moslem holy month just ending. `` I have never seen such a big liar,'' <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps he did n't mean this year.'' Commanders chose <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> as the first major guerrilla target after Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15, ending more than nine years of participation in a civil war that has cost more than 1 million lives. In the early days, the guerrillas captured army outposts around the city, which is near the <LOCATION> Khyber </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and 45 miles from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Then the conscript Afghan army rallied and the campaign settled into stalemate. Insurgents launch rockets into the city and government forces respond with artillery fire and bombing raids. Guerrilla units advance on government positions and are driven back. `` The presence of the Soviets had ill effects,'' <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said. Afghan soldiers `` were relying on the Soviets to do it all. Now their morale has changed considerably. You ca n't compare it with three months ago.'' Shortly after the Soviet withdrawal, the alliance of insurgent groups formed an interim government in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said the government was `` imaginary ... born in a dead body.'' He said the civil war will continue for years unless a political settlement is reached. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has offered a coalition government and other compromises, but all have been rejected by the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> also has called for direct talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused. <PERSON> Kawyani </PERSON> said Friday: `` We have one hope: that the Americans will reverse the position. The past three months have shown ... that no military solution is possible. Compromises are needed and we are ready.'' `` The Americans should accept this in principle. Later on, we can talk about details.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sein Win, correspondent in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, collected a freedom of the press award Friday that he had won 26 years ago. In a ceremony at the headquarters of the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, Executive Director <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Balding </PERSON> presented the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> correspondent since 1969 with the Golden Pen of Freedom award. The annual award was established in 1961 to recognize outstanding actions by an individual, group or institution to advance freedom of the press. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, 68, won the award in 1962, when he was editor and publisher of the Guardian, an independent English-language newspaper in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. A military regime took over in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> that year and curbed the press. He has been jailed three times since the late 1950s for his journalistic work, spending more than three years in jail, including a one-month stint last year. Sein Win had been banned by his government from traveling abroad until late last year when he received permission to attend the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which begins next week in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> was elected to the institute's board in 1963. He decided to stop in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to collect the award. `` I am very happy to receive this award after so many years,'' he said. `` I never thought I would receive permission to leave to come get it.'' <PERSON> Balding </PERSON> said it was fitting Win received the award after his third stint in prison since he was named the recipient just after his first term in jail. `` History has proved a wise choice was made,'' <PERSON> Balding </PERSON> said. `` I hope the other winners stand up to the test of time as well as you have.'' Other winners include <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Beuve-Mery </PERSON>, the founder of the French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Timerman </PERSON>, formerly of La Opinion of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Heard </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Catholics, Moslems to Ease Rivalry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, reflecting the church's concern about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, urged Roman Catholics and Moslems on Friday to avoid aggressive tactics in the battle for converts. In a speech to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops on the last full day of his nine-day African tour, the pope raised the issue of the church's tense relations with Moslems in this southern African nation. `` What is required is mutual respect, as well as mutual recognition of those things that we share in common,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Both among Christians working for unity in obedience to Christ and among believers of different religions, there is no place for aggressive proselytism which disturbs and hurts, still less for the use of unworthy methods,'' he added. The pope quoted from his speech to Moslems in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in 1985: `` Christians and Moslems ... have badly understood each other, and sometimes, in the past, have opposed and even exhausted each in polemics and in wars. I believe that today God invites us to change our old practices.'' There are 2.5 million Catholics and 1 million Moslems in this country of 8 million people. The rest of the population is made up mostly of Anglicans, Protestants and animists. Islam has been growing rapidly in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> since the early 1970s. Financed in part by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> petrodollars, Moslems have built hundreds of mosques across the country. Tensions grew after Moslem extremists set fire to several <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> in 1983-84. Last August, several <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youths and an elderly religion teacher were forcibly circumcised in a suburb of <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION> by Moslem fundamentalists, church officials said. Some Moslem leaders here have said they are upset that the pope's visit to <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> came during the Moslem holy period of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The issue has significance for all of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Church officials have expressed concern about the spread of Moslem fundamentalism in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and other African countries. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in February criticized the imposition of Islamic law on non-Moslems. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials say the competition for converts in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is crucial. `` A big question is whether <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will be a Christian or a Moslem continent 25 years from now,'' said <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. `` The church can not compete with the billions of dollars that is financing Islam in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The pope also celebrated a morning Mass for more than 100,000 people at <LOCATION> Blantyre </LOCATION>'s Kwacha -LRB- Freedom -RRB- Park, addressed at least 60,000 youths at the <LOCATION> Kamuzu </LOCATION> sports stadium and met with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> laity and representatives of other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> faiths and other religions. In his homily, he urged his flock to treat victims of AIDS as `` we would treat Christ himself.'' <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> has one of the highest rates of AIDS in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. According to local health officials, as many as 20 percent of newborn children are infected with the AIDS virus. At the stadium ceremony, school children wearing colorful uniforms danced and sang to gospel-rock music as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived in a glass-enclosed vehicle.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders say they expect speedy completion of a compromise federal budget, now that both chambers have passed mirror-image $ 1.2 trillion spending plans that cause little political pain. Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol approved fiscal 1990 budgets on Thursday, obediently consenting to proposals whose foundations were laid in talks last month between congressional leaders and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials. With bipartisan amity that has been glaringly absent in most budget debates, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted its plan 68-31, while the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> signed off 263-157. `` We are pleased that the process is moving forward, and in a quicker manner than in past years,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. `` We will continue to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the budget and we find these resolutions provide a very optimistic prospect for reaching agreement.'' Supporters said the budgets were the best available solutions to the gridlock created by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` no new taxes'' pledge and Democratic reluctance to slash domestic programs. Yet they conceded that their talks with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which lasted about as long as the biblical flood, had not yielded a perfect instrument. `` We did n't produce what <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> did,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some even think we barely produced a rowboat.'' There are few significant differences between the two plans, mainly because overall totals for revenues, deficit reduction and defense, domestic and foreign aid spending were cemented in the White House-congressional budget pact. <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will have to settle relatively minor differences in how the two chambers would distribute money among education, science, criminal justice and other domestic programs. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders have said their goal is to complete work on a compromise budget by mid-May, which if accomplished would be the earliest date of completion in 11 years. That bargaining should begin next week. `` We should be able to resolve our differences quickly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. Both houses' budgets claim to chop the $ 163 billion deficit expected in fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, to just over $ 99 billion next year. The plans have been criticized, however, for relying largely on overly optimistic economic projections, accounting gimmicks, and one-time savings, therefore doing little to truly ease the government's long-range deficit ills. `` So the heck with the next generation, and whoopee for the next election,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> A <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> amendment that would have forced $ 32 billion in savings by holding most spending at this year's levels was rejected, 82-18. Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders in both chambers flexed their legislative muscles all day Thursday, quashing a slew of amendments aimed at scuttling the budgets' taxing and spending formulas. Among the defeated proposals were a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> amendment by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> that would have cut defense spending, raised taxes on the wealthy and beefed up domestic programs, and a motion by Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., that would have given the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> three days to produce deeper cuts Under both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposals, federal receipts would rise by $ 14.2 billion next year: $ 5.3 billion in unspecified taxes, $ 5.7 billion in unnamed sales of federal assets, $ 2.7 billion in higher fees for government services, and $ 500 million by boosting the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to collect levies. Defense spending would reach $ 299.2 billion, about $ 4.7 billion below the amount President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought when he presented his original budget proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February. Foreign aid would receive $ 16.7 billion, enough to compensate for inflation over the last year. On the domestic side, $ 2.3 billion in savings would come from restraining <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to doctors and hospitals. Another $ 6 billion would come from reductions in other programs the law says must be financed, including $ 1.1 billion in yet-undecided reforms in the postal service and federal pension programs. Critics have said some of these savings are of questionable validity, such as $ 1.7 billion by moving the postal service `` off-budget,'' and $ 477 million by claiming savings from unused food stamps. Recipients of benefit programs, such as Social Security, would receive their regularly scheduled annual cost-of-living increases. Programs for low-income people such as handicapped education and employment for the elderly would receive high enough increases over this year to cover the bite of inflation. Programs for children, such as Head Start and child care, would be boosted by even more. Federal assistance would also be signficantly beefed up for anti-drug programs, AIDS research and treatment, space, science, aviation and the homeless. The budget resolution, once the two chambers complete a compromise, is used as a guide by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it writes its spending and tax legislation.

 <PERSON> Thakin </PERSON> <PERSON> Soe </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most prominent communist leaders, has died at the age of 83, reports said Friday. <PERSON> Soe </PERSON>, who died Thursday following a long, undisclosed illness, was the only surviving founding member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, formed in 1937. He spent most of his life underground and for a time led the Red Flag, or Trotskyite, branch of the party. He was captured by government forces in 1970 but released in a 1974 amnesty by the military government of former strongman Ne Win. Following student demonstrations, the military government of Gen.

While a number of former communist guerrillas have come to the government side or given up their struggle, the <ORGANIZATION> Burmese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> continues to battle the central government from bases along the Chinese border.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> purchasing agent was sentenced today to a year and a day in federal prison for taking kickbacks from defense subcontractors in return for business with the aerospace company. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> on his January 1988 guilty pleas to three counts as part of a plea bargain with government attorneys. In exchange, prosecutors dropped 24 other counts. In imposing sentence, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> said he had `` considered the extensive cooperation'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had given investigators, `` which I understand he will continue to do in the future.'' Following <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s indictment by a federal grand jury in October 1987, 12 other individuals and nine companies were charged in the scheme. All subsequently pleaded guilty and have been sentenced. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 44, showed no emotion during sentencing and declined to comment after the brief hearing. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> to concurrent 366-day terms on one count each of mail fraud and accepting kickbacks. On the third count, filing a false federal income tax return, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> suspended sentence and gave <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> five years' probation commencing with his release from prison. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> also was fined $ 30,000 and ordered to pay $ 150 in victim assessment fees. He was ordered to surrender to federal authorities June 2. In indicting <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in 1987, government attorneys alleged that for more than three years, he had taken kickbacks from suppliers and earned illegal profits by routing materials through three companies he created and operated from his basement. Prosecutors said they could not determine how much money <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had received altogether, but that from one subcontractor alone he had taken between $ 30,000 and $ 50,000. Neither Morton Thiokol nor any other current or former employees of the company were charged in the kickback scheme.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Friday lost a parliamentary seat it has held for 38 years, in a sharp rebuff the victorious <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said showed that voters are weary of her capitalist revolution. The blow came as Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> marked her 10th anniversary in power and declared she has transformed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claimed its stunning victory in the <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glamorgan </ORGANIZATION> shows voters are particularly wary of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s latest free-market crusade _ to overhaul the free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that is a cornerstone of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s welfare state. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s days are numbered,'' declared <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who overturned the Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority to win by 6,028 votes. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> swept through the largely rural district's main town, the port of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, in an open-top bus thronged by cheering supportesr celebrating the huge 12 -LCB- percent swing against the government. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s win is a `` warning to the government it is not as popular as it would like to be. `` But it is not in any way depressing or intimidating,'' <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> added. Defeated Conservative candidate <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> acknowledged voter hostility to the health service program and other reforms Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is pursuing in her third term. They include a new property tax and selling off the national water and electricity utilities. `` We have to win that debate in the country and it will take time because we are changing things quite radically,'' <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said. Labor also was boosted by the collapse of support for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s squabbling center parties, which split after the 1987 general election and adopted rivalries now ridiculed as `` the muddle in the middle. Labor polled 23,342 votes to the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION>' 17,314. The centrist Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took only 2,017 and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democractic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes. The Vale of <LOCATION> Glamorgan </LOCATION>, where the previous legislator died this year, was only the fourth district in 25 years that Labor has snatched from the Conservatives in a by-election. Polling was Thursday, the 10th anniversary of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s accession to the premiership Now in her third five-year term, she must call the next election by mid-1992. Until then, she still commands a huge majority of 101 seats in the 650-member House of Commons. Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 228, the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 19 and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 3. Minority regional parties hold the rest. Earlier, the Conservatives and Laborites did well in county council elections in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, making substantial gains at the expense of the center parties. <ORGANIZATION> Tory </ORGANIZATION> and Labor leaders said that British politics is back in the traditional two-party mold, which was upset by the formation of a burgeoning centrist alliance in 1981. In 1983 and 1987 general elections, the centrists took nearly one-fourth of the vote, although they won few seats and often helped a Conservative to victory by splitting the anti-Thatcher vote. In Thursday's elections for 47 county councils, the Conservatives finished with overall control of 19, up from 12, and Labor with 13, up from nine. The Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> kept control of their sole county council, the Isle of <PERSON> Wight </PERSON>, but lost seats across the country. Independents had control of two county councils and no party had overall control in the other 12. Adding to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s problems is a resurgence in inflation, now at 7.9 percent and among the highest in industrialized countries, and a hefty balance of payments deficit that topped $ 2.8 billion in March. In addition, labor unions are flexing their muscles after years of defeats. Railmen, dockers, engineers, firefighters, electricians, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway drivers and <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> journalists and production staff all are threatening strikes. Some Conservative claim the unrest may be organized. `` This is beginning to look like a conspiracy,'' said Tory legislator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenway </PERSON>. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> remains ahead in national opinion polls _ three points ahead of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> with 42-percent support matching that of 1987.

 Police say a 15-year-old who put a straight pin in a jar of his family's baby food apparently did it to get some attention, solving the last of three food tampering cases reported in the state this week. There were no injuries in any of the cases. A <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> family reported Monday that they found a pin in a jar of apricot-yogurt baby food they bought last week at an Eagle store. <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> said Thursday that after investigators interviewed the family extensively and the family agreed to take polygraph tests, the 15-year-old son admitted to placing the straight pin in the baby food jar. `` I think it has something to do with his getting attention,'' Weeks said of the teen-ager. `` Apparently he had heard about the situation in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> and apparently decided it was n't a bad idea.'' The youth has not been charged, police Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said today. The <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> incident followed one in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> Friday in which a baby sitter said she found pins in two jars of <LOCATION> Heinz </LOCATION> baby food. Authorities said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rexroad </PERSON> reported finding the pins to make herself look good to the parents. Ms. <PERSON> Rexroad </PERSON>, 42, was charged Wednesday with communication of false information of tainting of a consumer product, a felony carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. She was released on her own recognizance. The third case was a candy-tampering hoax in the <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> area, police said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON>, a 26, of <LOCATION> Lovington </LOCATION>, was charged Wednesday with making a false report to police. <PERSON> Gentry </PERSON> reported Tuesday that candy he bought from a vending machine contained sharp metal pieces.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials ended five days of trade talks Friday without reaching any agreement, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to further liberalize its trade practices. During Friday's session, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> officials provided full details of the government's plan to cut its trade surplus to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. `` In many areas, the plan has made a positive contribution,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said, `` but in other areas, the plan is not as ambitious as it could be.'' <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> presented outlines of the four-year plan to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in March to try to avoid possible trade retaliation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under the plan, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is to liberalize its financial and trade markets to reduce this island's trade imbalance by at least 10 percent each year and gradually cut import tariffs until they average 7 percent in 1992. Last year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> registered a trade surplus of $ 10.4 billion with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation said the plan still allows <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to maintain high tariffs on agricultural products. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also called for the lifting the ban on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s imports of several agricultural products. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s import tariffs for agricutural items currently average 25.99 percent and will be lowered to 19.82 percent in 1992 under the action plan. Officials here argued that the government can only agree to smaller tariff cuts in agricultural items to protect the interests of local farmers. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side recognized <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s efforts in the direction of liberalization, but `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is still encouraged to do more.'' He said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was also urged to open more access to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to set up bank branches, insurance companies, and security firms here. Last week, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> was cited in a report by the Office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative as one of 34 countries which allegedly impose unfair barriers in trade with the <LOCATION> Unied </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative is expected to select nations by May 30 for possible sanctions for unfair trade practices under the `` Super 301'' provision of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Omnibus Trade Act. Many believe <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, which ranked fourth among the 34 countries may be placed on the priority list. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> of maintaining barriers through import licensing, limits on access to the insurance market, agricultural export susidies, ineffective intellectual-property protection and monopoly practices.

I was able to arrange this trip so that I would be away less than 24 hours,'' she said. `` We have turned our dining room into his bedroom. `` Every night, we pull a mattress and a sleeping bag from under the hospital bed and one of us sleeps by his side,'' she said.

 Here is a sampling of editorial opinions on the verdicts reached in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial: From <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Newsday: The lasting, historical significance of the conviction of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is that in this country not even a man labeled a national hero is above the law. In the end, 12 citizens after 12 days of deliberation found that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> _ no matter what his position, no matter what his mission, no matter what the president called him _ was guilty. They found that he obstructed a congressional inquiry into the Iran-contra affair, shredded official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> documents and illegally accepted a $ 14,000 gratuity. This national hero is now a convicted felon.

 We hear a lot about this contemporary time's lack of heroes. One reason we lack them is that we tear down the ones we otherwise might have _ for instance, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Who would want to be a hero and endure what he has endured? Here is a man who has laid down his life for others _ in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There are many who owe, in both places, their lives to his. He has been called a `` hero'' by two Presidents. A leader of the Contras testified, `` We are going to erect a monument to Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> once we free <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' Yet he has been run down by the very government for which he toiled. The President who could have saved him did not. The jury tried, but came up short. And now, the legalistic hounding will continue _ of <LOCATION> Colonel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and others _ with all the consequent anguish and cost.

 From the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- American-Statesman: North is no national hero. But he is certainly not totally to blame for what happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. The jury seems to have understood that. So should the public.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From The Evening Sun in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>: From the time <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> first came to public attention in the midst of the Iran-contra affair, he has been a riveting and controversial figure. Many Americans followed the lead of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who pronounced North a `` national hero'' despite the fact that he had just fired him. Others saw him more clearly _ as a complicated man whose energy epitomized the can-do spirit Americans thrive on, but one whose zeal overcame his judgment. Now, in a trial remarkable for its fairness under the glare of publicity and controversy, a jury has concluded that in three specific cases <PERSON> North </PERSON> did indeed step over the line that should have separated vigorous pursuit of his duty from criminal acts. ... Americans can admire commitment and zeal. They can admire many of the qualities <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> has long sought to exemplify. But zeal and commitment must be tempered by judgment. That's one function of law _ to establish boundaries that impose good judgment on excessive zeal. North and his supporters are claiming a victory in the fact that his was acquitted on nine other counts. But those acquittals do not erase the seriousness of the charges for which he was found guilty. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From The <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Register: ... It is simply unfair for one low-echelon aide to bear the brunt of the charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. Perhaps the appeals courts will realize that and throw the case out. Or perhaps President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will get there first, and pardon <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 From the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Daily News: <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial shares similaries with that of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, who leaked the Pentagon Papers. In the 1973 Ellsberg-Russo case, which ended in a mistrial, the defense argued not that <PERSON> Ellsberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Russo </PERSON> were not involved in the leak of the Pentagon Papers, but that those papers never should have been classified. North's defense also was based on a disagreement with the law; most of his actions were predicated on a belief that the president, not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, should run foreign policy ... In light of Thursday's verdict, the spending of over $ 12 million by special prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to build a case against <PERSON> North </PERSON> has to be considered overkill. ... The good news is that while the prosecution against <PERSON> North </PERSON> was politically motivated, the jury's verdict was fair and balanced If ... punishment goes so far, say, as to end the much-decorated veteran's military pension, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should pardon <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who has paid greatly for his mistakes as it is.

<TEXT>
 From The Morning News Tribune in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>: The anti-climactic finale to the North affair was a letdown politically. But that's beside the point. It so happened that the passions aroused by the Iran-Contra scandal came to focus on <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, and that partisans of both sides sought vindication in the verdict. But in this country, trials are n't staged for political vindication: They're held to decide the guilt or innocence of the accused North received all the due process that any defendant could have asked for.

<TEXT>
 From The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>: No man, the jurors found, stands above the law, once again reaffirming the most basic tenet in the American legal system. The rules of law hold even if the wrongdoing conceded by <PERSON> North </PERSON> was performed under the direction of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, as <PERSON> North </PERSON> contended. Openly enthusiastic about his covert assignment to arm and otherwise assist the Nicaraguan Contras at a time when such aid had been banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> undoubtedly believed he was acting with the understanding and support of his superiors in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. Nor is there reason to doubt that those superiors shared his conviction. Under almost any other circumstances, they would have been charged in some way, along with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Instead, they left him to face trial alone, whch may have persuaded the jury to dismiss other counts against him. His defense, that he was led to believe that everything he did was done at the direction of the president, does not excuse him. The trial was thorough; the law has been upheld.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 From The Washington Post: If the jurors had bought Mr. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s whole defense, they would have sent a message that any subterfuge, any ignoring of a congressional mandate, any covert and illegal act in the furtherance of what a small group inside the government believes to be in the best interests of the country, is justifiable. They did n't do that. The verdict is a statement that such acts are wrong and punishable even if the defendant believed he was acting on the orders of his superiors. ... These jurors were not charged with deciding what other officials were involved in this deception and cover-up. But in their long deliberations and mixed verdict, they have indicated that they do n't believe Mr. <PERSON> North </PERSON> was the sole, or even the principal, offender.

 From the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>: For many who viewed former Lt. <PERSON> Col </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a hero, Thursday's verdict will be hard to accept. Facing 12 counts in connection with the Iran-contra scandal, he was acquitted of nine but convicted of three. Was that justice for a loyal Marine who thought he was serving his country, and assumed tacit approval by his commander in chief? It was if the verdict is seen in the proper light. Iran-Contra was not about one Marine's loyalty or naivete. It was about a government within a government, a secret operation that generated funds by selling arms at a profit, and used the profits to carry out foreign policy _ all of it outside the parameters of constitutional government. ... ... If Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> inspires sympathy even now, it's no doubt because he was used by those higher-ups _ the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, and two former nation security advisors, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFarlane </PERSON> and Admiral <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. ... ... Used or not, Col. <PERSON> North </PERSON> was responsible for obeying the law. ... ... The jury understood. Now the American public must understand as well _ even those who still admire the man more than the verdict.

 The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> office of the West German airline <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> was attacked by an unidentified group of people while it was closed Friday for the Moslem weekend, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s news agency reported. The office `` sustained some damage,'' said the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It gave no details. The incident followed calls in Iranian newspapers for expulsion of West German diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> reflecting an anti-Western trend that is being fueled by a fundamentalist revival. The Farsi-language <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION> daily said last month that West German diplomats in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were `` spies disguised as diplomats.'' Iranian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said a few days earlier that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was implicated in a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy network allegedly uncovered by Iranian intelligence. He said that a network of Iranian agents working for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had been exposed, many of whom were communicating with the agency through West German embassies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Intelligence Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammadi-Reyshahri </PERSON> later said the spies were linked with the American military base in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where many had received training. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also has accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of supplying its enemy <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with technology to build long-range missiles and chemical weapons.

 Union Station, the landmark rail depot where <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON> vamped for photographers and thousands of servicemen departed for wars, is 50 years old. The celebration was scheduled to get under way today with the arrival of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Daylight'' locomotive 4449 that pulled the `` Freedom Train'' across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the nation's 1976 bicentennial. Festivities focusing on Union Station's role as the city's transportation hub continue through the weekend with exhibits, speeches and entertainment While airplanes derailed interest in train travel for decades, depot spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said there has been a resurgence in Union Station travelers. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diegan </LOCATION>, for instance, carries 5,000 people daily. `` More people are coming here everyday, particularly this past year,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said. Crowds still stream into downtown Union Station, enraptured by its ornate 52-foot ceilings, its Spanish-Moorish architecture, gardens and old <ORGANIZATION> Harvey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. Sixty trains a day used the station before World War II, when 100 trains came and went daily, many with soldiers and sailors going to war. After the war, European refugees poured through the station, which was dedicated May 3, 1939. Union Station's grandeur is frequently seen in movies and on TV. The grand mission-style building was prominent in the movie `` The Way We Were'' with Barbra Streisand and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, the location for the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> movie `` Union Station'' and dozens of television shows. Vivid memories linger among natives who picked up friends and relatives at Union Station, a trip made complete with a visit to the nearby Mexican-theme Olvera Street or <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON>'s cafe across the street for a French dip sandwich and coffee, still a nickel a cup through the 1980s. Before the age of air travel, politicians such as <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> used Union Station to embark on whistle-stops. Football fans remember the noisy ceremonies surrounding departures of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> team, particularly festivities accompanying the trainloads of players and fans headed for the Notre Dame game in South Bend, Ind. In the heydey of train travel, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> publicity men used the occasion of Union Station celebrity departures and arrivals to generate press. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamour </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> rode the rails in and out of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with great fanfare.

<HEAD>Election Day Didn't Settle Questions on Bush's Iran-Contra Role</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had reason to feel last Election Day that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people had delivered their verdict on his role in the Iran-Contra affair, much to his annoyance, questions persist. But there is a widespread feeling that the demand for answers diminishes rapidly the farther one is from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` The thing has been around so long, it's kind of old news,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. With a slight nod toward partisanship, <PERSON> Hamby </PERSON> quickly added that `` if there's any curiosity out there,'' it concerns <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration deliberations on arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the diversion of funds to the Contras. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he knew about the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales but has denied any knowledge of the diversion. `` I do n't think there's any outcry of any kind across this country for any questions about this issue,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahe </PERSON>, a Republican consultant. `` This issue ceased to exist for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people a long time ago.'' The fact is that neither the foreign policy scandal nor the persona of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> quite lived up to the expectations of partisans on both sides. Democrats saw the Iran-Contra affair as an issue that would cripple Republican chances to hold the White House in the 1988 election. Conservatives saw <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the Marine lieutenant colonel with a chest full of medals, as a symbol who would rally voters to reject his Democratic tormentors. For a while, both had reason for high hopes. `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' shouted exuberant Democrats at their 1988 nominating convention and at later rallies for nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It sounded and looked like a great way to focus attention on the unanswered questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in the affair. But voters seemed to care more about <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> than <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and were more disturbed about the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program than the Iran-Contra scandal. At the same time, <PERSON> North </PERSON> never emerged as the national hero conservatives sought. Americans responded with a flood of pro-North letters and telegrams after his televised appearance before congressional investigators in July 1987, an outpouring that generated a quick flurry of what was dubbed <LOCATION> Olliemania </LOCATION>, complete with T-shirts and appeals that he run for public office. North still commands speaking fees of up to $ 25,000 an appearance, but his presence no longer makes politicians _ particularly Democrats _ uneasy. If anyone is uneasy these days it might be White House aides as they watch conservatives try to generate pressure on the president to pardon the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. `` He was never as hot as he was that week in July 1987,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` It was that one period of time, it was a very short T-shirt sale period.'' As the jury in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial was preparing to announce its verdict Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> welcomed the question about his role in the Iran-Contra affair as if he thought one more answer would put an end to the inquiries. It did n't and now he might want to take his press secretary's advice and leave the questions `` to the historians. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked the prestige of his office in trying, once and for all, to deal with questions about his meeting with the president of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in 1985. At issue is whether the then-vice president knew the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was expecting <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to aid the Contras in return for American aid. `` The word of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ is, there was no quid pro quo,'' responded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` There has been much needless, mindless speculation about my word of honor and I've answered it now, definitively,'' said an obviously annoyed president. But as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must know, such questions never can be answered `` definitively.'' Details about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trip to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were disclosed in a memo placed in evidence at the North trial. The documents suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a greater role than acknowledged in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to keep the Contras in business. Congressional investigators never got that information and they now want to know why. `` The North trial raised a number of questions that I think are still unanswered,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., who chaired the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the Iran-Contra affair `` We still have many, many unanswered questions about Iran-Contra and those should be pursued,'' he said. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he would advise the president to refuse to answer further questions. `` If there are unanswered questions, my vote would be to leave them to the historians and others who want to delve into this,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahsanullah </PERSON> sold a cow to get money to rebuild a house lost in last week's tornado, but many of the storm's other survivors do n't have such resources. `` I shall never get a house again,'' said <PERSON> Noorjahan </PERSON> <PERSON> Begum </PERSON>, who had moved into a new two-room home only two days before the tornado hit the <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> area, killing at least 1,100 people. The mud-and-straw house was given to her by a volunteer organization that works for the poor. `` Where shall I get the money?'' asked <PERSON> Noorjahan </PERSON>, a 35-year-old widow who lived with her three children in <LOCATION> Nirala </LOCATION>, a small village near <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>. Like many of the 130,000 people left homeless by the April 26 tornado, <PERSON> Noorjahan </PERSON> and her children are living outdoors and surviving on government-supplied food. The twister slashed through 40 villages, destroying at least 30,000 houses and injuring about 12,000 people. Some are suffering from gangrene, and doctors estimate at least 500 people will have to have arms or legs amputated because of gangrene. <PERSON> Ahsanullah </PERSON>, 45, who is well-off by local standards, said he sold one of his two cows for about $ 144 to rebuild his tin-roofed, wooden house in <LOCATION> Tilli </LOCATION> village. The government plan to build 2,400 houses and the non-government voluntary organizations have promished to construct 4,000 houses. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that more than 1,100 people died in the tornado. `` We are certain that more that 1,100 people perished in the tornado,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymnity. He said the 400 people listed as missing are now reported to be dead. Among those are 200 fishermen who were in their boats when the tornado hit about 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The storm also left lingering health problems, because water facilities were destroyed by the storm and people have been drinking polluted water. <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION> doctors said they had treated at least 500 people for diarrhea in the last five days and two had already died. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is plagued by a cycle of natural disasters that includes floods, drought, cyclones and tornadoes. The low-lying nation of 110 million people, most of it barely above sea level, has an average annual income of $ 160. Last summer, floods killed 1,400 people and left 2.5 million homeless. A cyclone in November claimed 1,100 lives. In <LOCATION> Ashkali </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Manikganj </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ashraf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> sat in the ruins of his house. `` Look, there was a house here. There was a happy home. Now I have nothing, nothing but an uncertain future,'' said <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 65. His wife, two daughters and grandson died in the tornado. `` There they are, sleeping in peace,'' he said, pointing to a mass grave. `` I need to join them.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Friday called for a worldwide campaign of terror against Americans and urged Palestinians to kill five Westerners for every Arab slain in the Israeli-occupied lands. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, shown on Iranian TV leaning on an AK-47 assault rifle, urged <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to `` declare open war on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests throughout the world. `` Why do n't you hijack planes in order to swap prisoners in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> hands, or blow up factories in Western countries?'' he said in a sermon during the weekly Shiite Moslem prayer session at <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, whose emotional speech was broadcast on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio and monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, was interrupted by thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> worshipers who chanted `` Death to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>!'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s comments were `` appalling'' and `` another step backwards for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from the community of civilized nations. `` It is an exhortation for Palestinians to commit terrorism and only serves to confirm that terrorism remains an integral feature of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would hold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responsible for any attacks on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests or citizens. He compared the comments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats against British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of the book `` The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems say the book blasphemes Islam and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has called for the author to be killed. After <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s remarks, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> office of the West German airline <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> was attacked Friday while it was closed for the Moslem weekend. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, gave no details but said the office `` sustained some damage.'' In his remarks, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> stressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be singled out as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s main backer but that Britons and Frenchmen also should be targets. `` If for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine -LRB- the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> -RRB- kill five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen outside, the Zionists would not dare continue these wrongs,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. `` It is n't so hard to kill Americans or Frenchmen, because they're all over the globe. It's a bit difficult to kill Israelis, because there are n't as many of them around in other parts of the world,'' he said. At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> denounced <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiative, in which he has renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The speaker said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its allies `` will never allow the formation of ... a Palestinian state. It is impossible.'' The extremist remarks by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, which came on the last Friday of the Moslem fasting month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, underlined a new and growing anti-Western trend in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that is part of a radical resurgence. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution, set aside May 5 as Qods Day, the Arabic name for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He has called on Islamic nations to free <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Islam's third holiest city after <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule. As <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> spoke, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported that millions of Iranians took to the streets in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and other cities to pledge support for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, chanting `` Death To <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>! Death To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also is <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acting commander-in-chief, said the West would now say he was `` officially called for acts of terror. He declared: `` Let them say it. Are n't they already saying it?'' `` They commit atrocities under the guise of human rights? We will do the same,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. `` We too will strive in the name of our rights to defend our people.''

 <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told her husband she loved him, but it took 45 years for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to get the message. The couple were bowling in <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> a couple weeks ago when <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> appeared with five `` V-Mail'' letters Mrs. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had written to her husband while he fought in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the waning days of World War II. That was the first time <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> had seen the letters. <PERSON> Crumb </PERSON> said he found the mail in some boxes he bought for $ 40 during an auction of the <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> estate in <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION> on April 22. He said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> probably inherited the letters from his father. But how did letters mailed to an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> unit in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> end up in <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s hands? The letters spanned the period from December 1944, the month <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> was taken prisoner by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, to March 4, 1945. Mrs. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> continued to write after she learned on Jan. 3, 1945, that her husband was missing in action and before she found out four months later that he was still alive. And therein may lie an explanation for what happened to the letters. `` The postmaster knew my wife's father,'' said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` Maybe he thought the letters coming back might upset her and gave them to <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>.'' In any event, `` Something told me he was coming back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The long-lost letters will be kept in a secure place. `` I ought to have them laminated,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said.

 College geology departments across the nation have been threatened with extinction because of declining enrollment, but they're on the rebound because of a totally extinct subject, says a researcher. Brisk sales of dinosaur cereal, noodles, toys and books have inspired educators to use dinosaurs in the classroom, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFadden </PERSON>, a natural science curator at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> who surveyed 50 colleges and universities nationwide. High unemployment in the oil and mining industries and changing academic requirements had discouraged enrollment until dinosaurs were emphasized, he said. `` People have always been fascinated by dinosaurs, but they're enjoying renewed interest because of revolutionary new theories about these giant prehistoric creatures,'' he said `` Enrollment in most dinosaur courses far exceeds other new courses, sometimes by twice as much,'' said <PERSON> MacFadden </PERSON>, whose research appears in the May issue of Geotimes magazine.

<HEAD>Wright Says His Public Service Outweighs Any Ethical Shortcomings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> argued Friday that his decades of public service outweigh any personal ethical shortcomings and suggested that political attacks against him are far more unethical than any failure of his own. `` Because I hold passionately to certain political beliefs, I have made formidable political opponents in 40 years of active public life,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a Law Day speech on ethics to a hometown crowd in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. `` But I have never sought to destroy another man's character, nor to deprive him of his dignity. In these 40 years of public life, the most unethical behavior I have witnessed is that of those who, for their own ravening ambitions, attempt to destroy the personal reputations of political opponents.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s leadership post has been threatened because of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee probe that has alleged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> broke <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules 69 times in his personal financial dealings. By turns combative and contrite, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sought in his remarks to refocus the debate on his ethics to public policy rather than personal finances. A text of his speech was released by his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he had read a copy of the speech `` Everyone's entitled to their own opinion I did n't think it addressed the issues that we're discussing here, nor do I think he should be,'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` I think he should wait and present that testimony before the committee.'' As <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke, the ethics panel continued for the third straight day to interview participants in a 1988 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gas-drilling venture that has raised suspicions that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was steered into the lucrative deal as a gift to buy favor with a powerful legislator. The panel questioned <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, who arranged for <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> _ an investment partnership involving <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, and their wives _ to buy into the gas well venture in January 1988. Five months later, the $ 9,120 investment was sold for a $ 340,000 profit. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had placed his interest in <LOCATION> Mallightco </LOCATION> in a blind trust in 1987 and instructed the trustee to sell that interest in a way that would earn him enough to pay off a $ 100,000 loan he had taken out four years earlier to invest in a nursing home business. The nursing home investment went sour and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> lost most of his money. But he did receive better treatment than other investors, collecting some $ 22,000 in dividends that others were denied, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that investment, and the debt it left for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, were relevant to the panel's probe of the gas drilling deal The profits from the gas deal were used last June to pay off the loan <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> obtained to invest in the nursing home. `` Certainly it will be a point of discussion with the committee, and I think relatively soon, meaning next week,'' he said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he and the committee's senior Republican, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, also would discuss at that time whether further investigation into the gas well deal is needed. The committee still must decide whether to add any charges from the gas deal to the 69 violations already alleged. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is expected to go before the ethics committee late this month for a disciplinary hearing, a trial-like proceeding in which evidence is presented to determine whether the charges can be proven. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, the speaker listed the values he said he shares with most Americans: `` To tell the truth. To keep your word. To pay your debts. To treat other people as you'd have them treat you. To protect those who are weaker and help those who are more needy than yourself. To give something of yourself ... To be there when your country needs you.'' He said he has sought to carry out those values `` in my own flawed fashion'' and pointed to his public policy positions favoring aid for the homeless, education and creation of jobs. `` These are some of the things which preoccupy me when I think of what is moral and what is ethical for a great nation,'' he said. He repeated contentions that his problems stem primarily not from anything he has done, but from his high-profile political position. `` It is a sad and sickening thing to see the political life of our nation become increasingly dominated by the tactics of negative campaigning,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` It contaminates the atmosphere of political dialogue and poisons the well of creative political thought.'' And he continued to criticize the ethics committee's special outside counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, for overzealousness. `` An aggressive <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> law firm, armed with the power of subpoena, has spent 10 months and almost $ 2 million of the taxpayers' money probing my public and private affairs, looking for things to criticize,'' he said. `` That fact in itself is a commentary of one sort or another.''

<HEAD>Census Challenged on Cost, Politics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The estimated cost of next year's national census was challenged as too low and the census' likely effect on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was criticized as unfair Thursday in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> estimates of a $ 2.6 billion pricetag for the national head count were questioned as probably too low by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. And a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> scholar asserted that the method used to reapportion the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> once census counts are finished is unfair to the larger states. <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a professor of public policy, said in testimony presented to the Subcommittee on Governmental Information and Regulation that he is not sure the current apportionment method meets the `` one person one vote'' standard. Following each census the seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are redistributed among the states using a complex formula, adopted in 1941, known as the `` Method of Equal Proportions.'' Several other methods have been used in the nation's history, each with some problem or other. At the heart of the dispute is the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has limited itself to 435 members. Each state gets one and the remaining 385 are then divided according to population. That's when the trouble starts. Because congressional districts can not cross state lines, no matter what number of people constitute an average district, they are never divided equally into every state population. The leftovers cause the problems and have led to long political fights. According to <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s calculations, the current system gives states with fewer people about a 3 percent advantage over larger states, a difference he considers unfair. Meanwhile, government officials disagreed before the subcommittee about the cost of collecting the data to divide up those seats. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency plans to spend $ 2.6 billion and can conduct a `` high quality'' census on that amount of money. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the bureau has not planned for all contingencies. <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> estimated that the 1990 count will cost as much as $ 3 billion before it is completed. <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> also urged Census officials to begin work immediately on planning for a census in the year 2000, so they can use lessons learned in 1990 to make that subsequent count easier and more accurate.

 Friends of <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> will throw a party rather than hold a memorial service for the woman who made history 36 years ago with a sex-change operation. Miss <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, who died Wednesday at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of cancer at age 62, wanted her ashes scattered at sea without a funeral, a friend, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said Thursday. Instead, the woman known as the world's first transsexual _ she despised the term _ asked that friends and relatives remember her at a lavish party, which Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said would be held in a few weeks. `` She loved to party, and that's what we're going to do,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who for the last six months shared an apartment with Ms. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> in this <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastal enclave. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> made headlines Dec. 1, 1952, when he underwent a sex-change operation at a Danish hospital and took the name <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>. Over the years she had nightclub acts, gave speeches and wrote a book, learning to embrace, according to her friend, the publicity she at first hated. `` <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> always got along with reporters,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` After all those terrible things they wrote about her early on, she still liked them. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> liked everyone.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> learned she had bladder cancer in 1987, and doctors found brain tumors six weeks ago, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. She underwent chemotherapy for 18 months, but when her condition deteriorated at the end she decided to forgo life-support machinery, the friend said. Ms. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> asked that donations in her memory be made to the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Friday named <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as countries that need to do more to reduce the huge trade surpluses they are running with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration's assessment, delivered by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and Undersecretary-designate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON>, was particularly critical of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The officials, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, indicated those two countries needed significant changes in policy to promote reductions in global trade imbalances. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said pointedly that discussions with South Korean officials had at times been `` quite frustrating.'' While some progress has been made in getting the government to allow its currency to strengthen in relation to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said more needed to be done in this area to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Earlier this week, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Soon Cho met with administration officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss trade. <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> indicated to reporters that he was resisting pressure to allow the Korean currency to appreciate further against the dollar. In his testimony, <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said that negotiations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were continuing and he said he hoped to be able to report progress by Oct. 15, when the law requires the next report on currency negotiations to be presented to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> said that the requirement in last year's trade law for the administration to target countries unfairly manipulating their currencies to boost their trade surpluses had been helpful in the on-going negotiations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> had made more progress in the currency area. He said that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s currency may now be at the proper level, given the fact that it has risen 12 percent against the dollar just since last October. <PERSON> Mulford </PERSON> indicated that the administration was satisfied with the dollar's current level against most major currencies, such as the Japanese yen and the West German mark. He repeated a commitment by the seven major industrial nations on April 2 that they would work to keep the dollar from rising further or dropping too sharply. In his prepared testimony, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that international efforts to coordinate trade and economic policies were showing results but that more progress was needed. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit narrowed by 21 percent last year, after hitting a record $ 152 billion in 1987, and predicted further improvement, although at a slower pace, in 1989. But <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the Japanese need to do more to open their markets to foreign goods, especially in view of the fact that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus fell only modestly in 1988 and is expected to be little changed this year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran a trade deficit of $ 52 billion with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last year, the largest with any nation. In discussing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was even more critical, stating that progress made by that nation in reducing its trade surpluses `` has been less satisfactory'' than in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s trade surplus rose to record levels in 1988 and is expected to climb even higher in 1989. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, hitting the Gramm-Rudman federal deficit target of $ 100 billion for next year would be the most important thing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could do to lower the deficit. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich. and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he feared that the big improvement in the trade deficit registered in 1988 had already stalled out and the deficit could begin rising again He said such a development would have ominous consequences for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign investment.

The search for a negotiating formula is one of the the major regional issues <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> intends to discuss with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> would provide a briefing on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks and also look into `` the next steps in the peace process.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has endorsed a proposal by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for elections among Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The winners would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> arrangements for temporary self-rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians then would negotiate an overall settlement. The Arab League and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> have rejected the proposal, while <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> have taken ambiguous positions. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has asked all sides to withhold final judgments until the details are worked out. His approach to the Soviets, another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, will be to ask their support for direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. This would mean a shift away from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s persistent call for an international peace conference. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is lukewarm to a conference unless it is no more than a device to further direct negotiations. Since the Soviets would be one of the sponsors, a conference could provide an opportunity for them to wield their influence on the outcome.

<HEAD>Three South African Diplomats Ousted Over Arms Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ousted three South African diplomats Friday over their country's alleged role in a deal with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> extremists to swap guns for British missile technology. Although the South African government denied involvement, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> appeared to implicate <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> when it spoke of `` the grave concern with which Her Majesty's Government viewed the involvement by South African officials in this affair.'' It gave the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> one week to withdraw First Secretary for Information Jan H.P. Castelyn, Counselor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourie </PERSON>, and Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, who works in the defense attache's office. While there was no suggestion they were implicated in the affair, their expulsion is a rebuff at a time when <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> seemed to be warming It came two weeks after <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> police raided a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> address and arrested a South African diplomat, an American arms dealer and three militant Protestants from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The Northern Irelanders, one a warrant officer in the province's <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, allegedly were handing over parts of a Blowpipe, a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile manufactured in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> British officials say they are gravely concerned by charges the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> were supplying weapons to the Protestants in exchange for the missile parts. The arrested South African, identified by French sources as <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, was released after claiming diplomatic immunity. A week later, the French government expelled three South African officials implicated in the affair. The three Irishmen and American <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON> are being held in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on gun-running and conspiracy charges. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> took the lead in ordering the expulsions, angered that she should be repaid in such a manner for defending <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> against a world drive for economic sanctions, said the domestic <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Permanent Undersecretary Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> summoned South African Ambassador <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Killen </PERSON> and informed him of the expulsions. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> warned that South Africans should be `` under no illusions'' about how gravely <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> views the affair. He reminded that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arms embargo, and that `` the lives of innocent people are at risk'' in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. British press reports say the South Africans are even more interested in the Blowpipe's sophisticated successor, the Starstreak. This week, newspapers reported that two technicians from Shorts, the state-owned manufacturer of Blowpipe and Starstreak, have been hired at four times their salaries to work for the South African arms industry. South African Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> acknowledged on April 24 that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sometimes uses `` unconventional methods'' to get around the arms embargo. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> called the Blowpipe affair a `` transgression'' he regretted, while <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said an official inquiry showed Storm acted without government approval. <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said he regretted the embarrassment caused to the British, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> governments and would make sure it did not happen again.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, making the first trip to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president in more than 11 years, will visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July to demonstrate support for their political and economic reforms, the White House said Friday. The stops, most likely to fall July 11-13, will come immediately before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the annual economic summit of the world's seven richest nations. The summit will be July 14-16. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said other countries may be added to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s itinerary after <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Likely candidates include <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` I look for a lengthy and productive trip,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The possibility of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> was raised by sources close to the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> government. The sources said prospects of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit will be discussed soon. However, White House officials said privately that such as stop was unlikely. Announcing the stops in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying `` to prod movement towards democracy and economic incentives in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` This is an opportunity for the president to reinforce the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' commitment, to express directly to the Polish people our support for the direction in which they are moving, express our support for Solidarity and the work of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` And the president's very personal interest in this should make this a very interesting trip,'' he added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has frequently talked about being deeply moved by his September 1987 visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, where he met with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the mother of a slain Roman Catholic priest. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be only the third sitting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to visit <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since World War II. The last was <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> who went to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in December 1977. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> also visited <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In September 1983, as vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, military allies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, are undergoing changes in their economic and political structures that are seen here as promising. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> earlier this year with the Hungarian and Polish foreign ministers and authorized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to speak positively of developments in the two countries. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is making big strides in economic changes, and even has a small stock market in operation, while <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has recognized the independent trade union movement Solidarity. On April 17, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced economic incentives to reward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for steps taken toward democracy and to encourage further political and economic reforms. The package included asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lower tariffs on certain Polish imports and seeking congressional approval of U.S.-guaranteed loans to stimulate private investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The president also announced a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to work with other Western financial leaders to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> deal with its $ 38 million foreign debt. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not release any details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, but sources said the initial itinerary calls for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spend a day in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and a night in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> before the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> representative was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service Friday for concealing illegal political donations from defense contractors to a congressman. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 55, who is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Ill Wind'' investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement fraud, was given a suspended three-year sentence and placed on two years' probation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> was sentenced for his admissions that he concealed from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> two $ 1,000 donations he collected from defense firms and funneled to the re-election campaign fund of the late Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> pleaded guilty Jan. 27 to conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> and causing a false report to be filed with the agency to conceal the donations <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, who was not charged in the case, denied ever knowing his campaign had received illegal corporate donations. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, who died last month, was defeated for re-election in a close vote last fall. During the brief sentencing hearing, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s cooperation with government prosecutors `` resulted in the rapid movement of the investigation and has opened up other areas of investigation.'' Several <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> officials had entered guilty pleas as a result of <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s cooperation, <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> noted. The prosecutor did not oppose a defense request that <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> be placed on probation. Among those whose convictions <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> helped obtain was that of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a former general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>'s surveillance and fire control systems divsion in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and filing false statements He has admitted bribing <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research, engineering and systems, by purchasing <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, condominium at an inflated price. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has not been charged, even though he is under investigation. At Friday's hearing, defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bensfield </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> ran afoul of the law when he followed <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s orders. `` Basically, he was carrying out the only orders of his only boss in the company at the time,'' <PERSON> Bensfield </PERSON> said. `` We're not talking about bribes here. We're not talking about the misuse of sensitive procurment information,'' <PERSON> Bensfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> told the judge, `` I made the mistake of trying to be a good soldier ... I've learned a lot this last year. I'll never make the same mistake again.''

 The Estonian Communist Party has removed 22 officials in a bid to halt its own waning popularity, officials and journalists said Friday. The housecleaning strengthens newcomers to <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> party leadership who are generally more progressive and tend to support the tiny <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s declaration of sovereignty. The 22 dropped from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday already had either left the republic or retired, said <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Valle </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>. The group included former party chief <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>, who spoke at Thursday's party meeting, accused some of the retiring members of involvement in the deportation of tens of thousands of Estonians to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and the Far North in the 1940s and 1950s. <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>, also a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, said several of the retirees were `` big bosses who participated in the deportations,'' Estonian radio reporter <PERSON> Sulev </PERSON> <PERSON> Halek </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s declining popularity was a factor in Thursday's action. A recent public opinion poll in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> found that more than 50 percent of residents support the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a grass-roots nationalist group, while only 7 percent back the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The Estonian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` must now take radical steps and quickly work out a program'' if it wants to hold its own among other political groups that are flourishing in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. The 22 were removed `` according to their own request'' in a move similar to the housecleaning last week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that dropped 110 former officials from the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership, he said. `` They were, to a great degree, responsible for the sad position we're in now, so of course they should take the consequences for it,'' <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief for almost a decade, was replaced in June 1988 after months of criticism for inaction on pollution and corruption. His replacement, <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>, is a reformer supported by the Popular Front. In a speech Thursday, <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> attacked several newspapers for supporting the radical <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks Estonian secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnaste </PERSON>, a leader of that group. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Interdvizhenie </PERSON>, a largely Russian group that objects to rising nationalism and political reform. In neighboring <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, the republic's parliament on Friday adopted a law opposed by Interdvizhenie declaring Latvian the official language of the republic, according to residents and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership on Thursday approved the draft law in the republic's capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> despite opposition from many non-Latvian residents, said <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Liepa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Liepa </PERSON> said the law was proposed because `` in many ways, the Latvian language has taken second place to Russian'' in much of the republic. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> adopted similar language laws last year.

 A memorial for Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, held yearly with little fanfare, has gained attention with a lawsuit against talk show host <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the relocation of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> to this city. `` It will certainly make <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON> a hotspot for conservatism, although I do n't think they want to be,'' <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> said Friday. He joined <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s anti-communist efforts after the two met in 1934 at <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. For each of the 32 years since <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> died, <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>'s Sen. <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McCarthy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has honored the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator with a ceremony at <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s grave at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>'s Cemetery. This year's ceremony is Sunday. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a native of nearby Grand Chute, led a crusade in the early 1950s, alleging communist influence in government, entertainment and other areas of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> society. His methods led to his censure by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1954. He died in 1957. The new exposure has not been accepted well by all officials in the city of 65,000 located on the banks of the <LOCATION> Fox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` I can not help where <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was born. In fact I can remember the McCarthy hearings ... But I do n't feel I have to comment about it. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is dead and gone,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bubolz </PERSON>, who political organization emphasizes fighting communism and reducing the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, said his group decided to relocate in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION> for convenience. It was `` just a bit of wonderful irony'' that it would be in <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s hometown, he said. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>'s lawsuit against <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> directly involves Sunday's ceremony and comes at a time when <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> is a focus of national controversy about free-speech rights A full-page advertisement that ran Friday in <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> reads `` Burn Mort? Why not just burn the Constitution. We believe in Mort ... We believe in freedom.'' It is signed by 25 people from a range of professions, including real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, entertainer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulet </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON>. The suit filed this week in <ORGANIZATION> Outagamie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeks $ 110,000, claiming <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> promised Jan. 16 to be a guest speaker at the ceremony and then withdrew in April. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said Friday he talked with <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> in January and told him he would speak at the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> ceremony only if he did not have a schedule conflict. `` What do they have to do, sue people to get people to come there?'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> asked during a phone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` I made an oral agreement with Mr. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> ... that I would appear if the dates did not conflict and the dates conflict,'' he added. `` As much as I would like to be there I can not because I have contracts, written contracts. Now Mr. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, being a lawyer, should understand that.'' <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s oral contract constituted the same binding agreement as a written contract under <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law. <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s office had told him it would send a videotape of the talk show host to use at the ceremony, but it was not received. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a history professor at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Menasha </LOCATION> and author of a book on McCarthyism, dismissed renewed interest in <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> as fleeting. `` I do n't think there is a rebirth of McCarthyism. I think it's a pretty shallow thing on the whole,'' he said `` It was more of an accident that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was born here and more of an accident that the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is moving here,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of working `` assiduously'' to divide <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners on Friday, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> conferred without apparent progress in a dispute over short-range missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The two leaders' 20-minute phone call did little to settle differences concerning <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s support for <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> talks on eliminating battlefield nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' posture has not changed,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> initiated the phone call. `` Discussions that would lead to a ... de-nuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would not be welcome,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. The spokesman voiced sharp skepticism toward peace initiatives by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and suggested the Soviets are seeking to exploit the current <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> rift. `` The Soviets have worked assiduously to try to divide the alliance. General Secretrary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made any number of proposals trying to convince people that there is no longer a threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And we are very wary of that approach,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, Soviet and East German diplomats used Friday's resumption of East-West talks on conventional weapons to emphasize <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> support for parallel talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons East German Ambassador <PERSON> Klaus-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> insisted such negotiations are vital to Germans, telling a news conference: `` The shorter the range of the rockets, the more dead Germans.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and some European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members want superpower talks on reducing tactical nuclear weapons, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> oppose such talks at least until the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons is erased. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also wants to modernize the aging arsenal of <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missiles clustered in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, many of them in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday that while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is open to talks within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on resolving the rift, `` it does not appear a basis for agreement is there.'' Of Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Kohl </ORGANIZATION> phone conversation, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I would not characterize it as moving the situation one way or another.'' The flap threatens to disrupt a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> summit late this month, called to celebrate the alliance's 40th anniversary. But Norwegian Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week, predicted a solution would be found at the summit, based on a linkage between cuts in conventional and short-range nuclear arms agreed on by the allies last year. Speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON> said Friday, `` We can negotiate for lower levels both in conventional and short-range -LRB- weapons -RRB-, and I do think it is possible to reach common ground on that basis.''

<TEXT>
 A court Friday convicted a gynecologist of violating laws restricting abortions and sentenced him to 2 -LCB- years in prison and banned him from practicing medicine for three years. The verdict drew protests from women's groups and the political opposition, which demanded that abortion laws be relaxed. A bomb threat forced evacuation of the court in the Bavarian village of <LOCATION> Memmingen </LOCATION> and caused a 90-minute delay in announcing a verdict. No bomb was found. Dr. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON> was accused of providing abortions to scores of women in violation of regulations imposed in 1976, three years after the operation was legalized. Abortion is legal during the first three months of pregnancy if the mother's health is at risk; in cases of rape of incest; or if there is proof the birth would cause `` extraordinary hardship.'' In addition, women must have two doctors confirm they fulfill legal requirements for abortion and also must show proof they received counseling on adoption as an alternative. The case against <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON>, 50, began in 1986 with an anonymous tip. Authorities raided his practice and impounded 1,390 patients' records Hundreds of his patients were ordered to fill out detailed questionnaires about their sexual behavior and personal finances or face prosecution themselves. The investigation resulted in indictments against <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON> and against 156 women who prosecutors said had undergone abortions without documenting the counseling and examination requirements. Most of the women were fined up to $ 1,600. The chief judge in <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON>'s eight-month trial, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barner </PERSON>, said the gynecologist `` deliberately went against the law, which stresses the protection of the fetus over a woman's freedom of choice.'' <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON> was found guilty on 36 counts of performing abortions without establishing that the women would suffer hardship because of childbirth, 39 counts of giving abortions without seeking a second opinion or the mandatory counseling, and four counts of attempted abortion. <PERSON> Theissen </PERSON>'s defense lawyers said they would appeal. A small group of pro-abortion activists demonstrated outside the court, and many women in the courtroom shed tears when the verdict was announced. The leftist Greens party said the verdict was a `` catastrophe for women.'' <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetting-Danmeilmeier </PERSON>, chief of the women's section of the opposition Social Democratic party, called the country's abortion law one of the most backward in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Kandia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouyate </PERSON>, in flowing, sequined gown and matching turban, glides onstage singing tales of her West African people. Coming to the stage of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after Pygmy dancers, Nigerian horn players and Pende dancers from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kouyate </PERSON> is the diva of `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Oye!'' a presentation of traditional and modern African music that launched a 10-week <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour Thursday night. She sings in her own language of the centuries-old history of the Mandingue people, a technique of oral history that makes her a virtual walking library. `` Do n't even try to pierce the mystery that the Mandingue hides. `` Do n't disturb the spirits at their eternal rest. `` Do n't enter dead cities to question the past,'' reads a translation of her song provided by the show's producers. Although the sell-out crowd of 2,600 may not understand the words, her rich, high voice brings it to its feet. After five concerts in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the tour goes on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. For the performers, it is an odyssey as much as a tour since many are seeing skyscrapers, elevators and superhighways for the first time. `` In my country, the dancers and musicians are repressed because it is thought to be primitive,'' said <PERSON> Botika </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekalaka </PERSON>, a member of the Batwa-Ekonda Pygmy performers, speaking in French through an interpreter. `` It's quite extraordinary to find it appreciated here.'' <LOCATION> Ekalaka </LOCATION> said of the evening's performance that he had never seen so many people together in one place. For some participants, `` <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Oye!'' is not the first time they've appeared on stage. Pop singer <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wemba </PERSON> has toured the world with his nine-piece band playing a blend of African rhythms and Western instruments. <PERSON> Kouyate </PERSON> has been broadcast across <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and performed on television. The show, more than two years in the making, is no mere collection of African music, its producers say. They scoured remote regions of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for the masters of various traditional and more modern musical techniques. Among the 52 participants in nine groups are artists from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>. `` The key to this is the variety, the musical sophistication and the raw power,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, producer of the American tour. `` African art is very direct. It does n't go to the mind for analysis. It goes directly to the emotions.'' Some of the performers began their pieces on the stage and in the audience creating a thunderous stereo effect. `` One of our tests is to keep the audience where they are, because there is a tendency for an audience to join in,'' said <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alliger </PERSON>, head of an avant-garde performance group called The Dance Umbrella, which is presenting the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> shows.

 Chlorine spewed from a gas tanker parked on a busy street in the capital Friday, and at least 34 people were hospitalized after inhaling the fumes, police said. A police official said it was not immediately known what caused the accident. He said most of the victims were on a bus passing the tanker at the time of the leak. Traffic was diverted and the tanker was towed off the street to a deserted area, he said.

<TEXT>
 Workers protesting an ailing economy and the military's role in the government staged a general strike Friday, shutting down schools, businesses and mass transit. No violence was reported, but streets in <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION>, the capital, were crowded with private cars and pedestrians curious about the success of the strike. Employees reported for work at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the former Dutch colony's main source of foreign revenue, and at the government power company. Police and firefighters were exempt from the strike. The 24-hour general strike called by four labor federations closed about 80 percent of businesses, schools and government offices. Public transportation, including buses and river ferries, was halted. The strike was called to show discontent with the government of President <PERSON> Ramsewak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON>, who took office in January 1988 after almost eight years of military dictatorship. Labor leaders said they called the strike to protest the deteriorating economy, which includes 60 percent inflation, and growing drug trafficking. Union leaders also want <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> to rein in the politically powerful 3,000-man army. Civilian leaders have little control over the military, and army critics and human rights leaders are often arrested by military police. Another aim of the strike was to press the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to renew a $ 1.5 billion aid program begun in 1975, when <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> gained independence. The Hague suspended aid after the military killed opposition leaders in late 1982. Negotiations over renewal have stalled, with <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> objecting to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' demand for more control over how the money is spent.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, over Panamanian objections, will send a 14-person commission to observe what he predicts will be fraudulent elections in the Central American nation Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The observers, led by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., will leave Saturday and fly to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to avoid that nation's visa requirements, said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> Naming the observer panel is part of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administraion's strategy to focus world attention on the election in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried unsuccessfully for more than a year to get Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power as the country's de facto ruler Panamanian officials have made it clear the offical <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team would not be welcome. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official noted that if <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> blocks the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers from visiting polling places, the action would serve the administration's purposes of casting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in a bad light. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and administration officials have predicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will steal the election for his presidential candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. They cite numerous instances of registration and ballot improprieties in the election preparations. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` have informed the appropriate authorities'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> about the team's arrival. However, he said he did not know how the Panamanians had responded. `` We're sending them in without visas. They probably wo n't have to have them,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. But reports from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have quoted officials as saying the observers would not be welcome and that only those invited by the government will be allowed to observe the balloting. `` That in itself would be a comment on the ` free and open' nature of their elections,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said when asked about <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> objections to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team `` We would expect this delegation to be able to observe many aspects of the election. ... We expect they will have access to a number of opportunities'' to view the polling places,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We have every reason to believe they'll be able to carry those out.'' Private observer teams also have been organized, one headed by former Presidents Carter and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> under the auspices of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. Other members of the official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team are Reps. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.

Under questioning, she said any increase of such magnitude would indicate the figures are falsified. She also said that so-called `` dignity battalions'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are being armed to intimidate the opposition and to discourage all thoughts of organized protest after the election.

 <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> hikes her black spandex miniskirt up a little further before stepping away from the doorway and into the thick springtime rain falling on Purchase Street. No customers in sight. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and empty, it's a slow afternoon along the six-block stretch of rundown storefronts and restaurants known as Weld Square, a section of this old whaling port where the easy money is in sex and drugs. The lure is strong enough to draw women like <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> onto the streets, even as police continue a well-publicized hunt for a serial killer who has found them such easy marks that he has murdered at least nine in the past year, many of them single mothers with drug habits. Two more women are missing. `` The girls are getting killed because they're easy to grab and easy to lure into a car,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, a former prostitute struggling with a recent relapse into heroin addiction. `` And even though they try to keep an eye on each other, there's no real protection.'' Big-city prostitution in crowded areas like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Times Square offers protection that's missing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. There are few pimps and no local by-the-hour hotels. The streets are not busy with pedestrians. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, prostitution is a business conducted away from people, often in cars parked under railroad trestles or in shadowy alleys. City Clerk <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidian </PERSON> likened the Weld Square strip to a shopping mall, where any stranger can take a highway off ramp to easy sex. `` It's a small-town kind of prostitution, not sophisticated,'' she said. `` But anyone who is required by their job to get into cars with strangers is certainly vulnerable.'' Recent affidavits filed in a case against a New Bedford-area man charged with several assaults paint a vivid picture of the dangers the women face. Twelve prostitutes interviewed by state police provided strikingly similar portraits of violence against them by the 26-year-old man, who appeared Friday in district court. They said he would pick them up in his truck and promise drugs or money. He would take them to a cemetery and force them into sex. He did n't pay and, to protect their business, the women did n't complain to authorities until state police sought them out as part of the serial killings investigation `` Their relationship to drugs is what ties these women together. Men turn to crime and women turn to prositution,'' said <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbin </PERSON>, director of the New Bedford Women's Center. `` It's a survival tactic borne out of desperation. It's not a career choice.'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, a general contractor and longtime resident of <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, says he has never been a customer but has watched his sister-in-law and other friends turn to prostitution as they wrestle powerful addictions to heroin and cocaine. `` You start out selling a little and then you sell a little more,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, who like most other residents interviewed asked that his last name not be used. `` Then all of a sudden all you've got left to sell is yourself. That's when they become back-alley girls. If you can give them 15 minutes and $ 20 then you've got a deal and they've got a fix.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, who said she straightened out six years ago after deciding to go back to school and get a teaching degree, said drugs are what push scores of prostitutes to endure constant threats and repeated assaults. `` When somebody is sick from needing a fix, they are in a tremendously vulnerable position,'' she said. `` All they need is someone _ I do n't care who it is _ to offer them a little bit of dope, just a little bit.''

 The parents of a 6-week-old girl whose body was found in a trash barrel in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> are suspects in the death, investigators said today. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> had told authorities the baby was abducted much like another infant daughter three years ago who also was found dead. `` The focus of the investigation is now leading to the parents,'' said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` An arrest is forthcoming.'' But <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> did not say when an arrest might be made. He said the parents had never been ruled out as suspects because of the similarities between <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s disappearance and that of their firstborn daughter, <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>, in 1986. A thorough search late Thursday of the couple's home and two vehicles, and the home of Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>' mother, produced valuable evidence, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. Authorities broke windows to get into the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> home in this town several hours after an autopsy across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, confirmed the identity of the body found there. The Simses were not at home, but went to the <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION> police station to answer questions later Thursday, said West Alton Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>. Police refused to say what they were looking for at the home. Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, would not comment on <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s cause of death, but said it was a homicide. At the old lock and dam, a popular spot for fishing and boating 30 miles north of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, at least two dozen federal, state and local investigators, assisted by dogs, searched for evidence where <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s body was found. `` We really want to solve this case, that's all we're worried about right now,'' said a sheriff's officer who helped seal off the area and did not want to be identified. `` We've got a whole bunch of people here because solving this case is our top priority.'' A fisherman found the baby's body Wednesday night. He searched the barrel and found the body in a plastic bag after he saw someone acting suspiciously, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Uebinger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Uebinger </PERSON> refused to say whether the fisherman had been able to describe the person seen near the barrel. The couple told police that a masked man approached Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> while she was taking out trash Saturday night, and that the gunman forced her back into the home, knocked her unconscious and took the infant. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said he was at work at the time. In June 1986, the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>, who then lived in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, reported to police that an armed intruder barged into their home _ again while <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was at work _ and took their 13-day-old baby, <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s remains were discovered a week later near the couple's home The cause of death never was determined and no one was charged. Investigators have said the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> were suspects, although the couple denied any involvement in the baby's disappearance. The couple has a 15-month-old son.

 Japanese co-production of American-designed jet engines is a `` viable alternative'' for the FSX fighter plane, but the issue remains to be firmly resolved, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Friday. The officials sought to assure a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, however, that manufacturing technologies for critical engine components would not be provided to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Under the $ 7 billion FSX deal, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> are to jointly co-develop and co-produce a new fighter, based on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16, for deployment by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the late 1990s. Congressional critics have charged that the agreement amounts to a `` giveaway'' of valuable advanced technology that may be used by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to propel its own aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They say <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> instead should buy American-made F-16s and help reduce the $ 55 billion trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Resolutions of disapproval to try to stop the deal have been introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Even if the resolutions were passed, however, it would require a two-thirds vote of both houses to override a likely veto by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The engine issue arose at a hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on economic stabilization, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said jet engines for six FSX prototype planes to be built under the development phase of the project would be provided a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer _ either <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. Oakar asked if the `` real goal'' of the Japanese was to manufacture as many of the engines as possible in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> when the FSX goes into production about five years from now. Current plans call for 130 aircraft to be built. <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> replied: `` I think the Japanese certainly would have an interest in licensed co-production under the production phase'' of the project. He added: `` We have agreed with the Japanese orally that that is a viable alternative.'' The engine question will not be firmly decided, <PERSON> Rudd </PERSON> said, until a separate U.S.-Japan memorandum of understanding is negotiated covering the production phase. Another <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, said that if co-production of the engines is undertaken, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not intend to transfer to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> proprietary manufacturing processes used for critical components. Asked whether the Japanese could simply copy the American manufacturing technologies, <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said: `` The metallurgy is in fact not something that you can reverse-engineer.'' In another development, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., renewed his criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s role in negotiating the FSX deal during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration without consulting the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> After the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took office, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> expressed concern over economic implications of the agreement, prompting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to send the deal back to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for `` clarifications'' on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share in the project and technology transfer questions. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said `` one thing in this whole mess is abundantly clear: we must never go through such a flawed process again. My concern is that we have zero assurance that this wo n't happen again.'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, have introduced legislation to require the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to be an equal partner in all agreements with other countries on the `` research, development and production of defense equipment In testimony Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said he is now satisfied with terms of the FSX deal.

 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> is sending doctors to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to treat victims of a powerful gas used against pro-independence demonstrators last month, a newspaper said Friday. The foreign doctors are being brought in because Soviet doctors have been unable to determine effective treatment for the patients injured in an April 9 clash. At least 19 people were killed when troops stormed the demonstration with gas, shovels and armored personnel carriers. A 20th victim died when he was shot for violating a curfew imposed to curb the unrest. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government daily, said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegation was expected to arrive in the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, on Friday to work with <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> doctors at a hospital where the injured demonstrators are being treated. But activist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> that the delegation had not yet arrived. Soviet authorities have said a gas known in the West as CS was used in the demonstration. It is an incapacitating agent whose effects are similar to a nerve toxin. Dozens of people suffering problems with their nervous system, vision, respiration and internal organs are still hospitalized, and some have begun a hunger strike to press authorities to reveal more about the effects of the gas and appropriate treatment. Human rights campaigner <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> on Thursday and told reporters he supports <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> help, according to <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is part of a team of newly elected members of the new Soviet parliament who are investigating the April 9 violence. He, historian <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Likhachev </PERSON> and space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> belong to an independent investigating commission. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and other commission members met Thursday with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s health minister, and <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON> said they visited the injured in a hospital on Friday. It is the second fact-finding trip <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has made to a nationalist hot spot in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Last year, he visited <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, to help mediate a dispute over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that Armenians claim is theirs. In another development, about 1,000 <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> women gathered Friday night outside <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the site of the bloody April 9 demonstration, to demand that authorities take stronger action to treat gas poisoning victims, <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON> said. They also demanded that authorities free four <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists arrested on charges of organizing the protest. Georgian party chief <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON> told the protesters the courts would decide the fate of the arrested activists, according to <PERSON> Dandurov </PERSON>. The women demonstrators then marched to a hospital where the victims are being treated and raised nationalist flags on the building's balconies, he said.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday from a 12-day trip abroad and reported on the journey to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over lunch in the Oval Office. Details of their hour-long discussion were not revealed. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also spent some time in his office and left at mid-afternoon for his residence. Earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said what he had learned on his 12-day trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will help him influence policy in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first stop after traveling 41 hours was the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where he had lunch with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Among the topics sure to be discussed were the oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited Thursday. The vice president toured an oil-drenched pebble beach on <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, talking with workers hired to wash stones. He told reporters at a midnight news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Elmendorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no plan to visit the devastated area but is keenly interested in the situation. The administration's view is that `` those who are responsible for it clean it up, and clean it up quickly,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He was accompanied on his tour by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, the tanker that ran aground on March 24, dumping 11 million gallons of crude into the sound, has been criticized by Alaskan officials, who say the company has failed to devote enough resources to the cleanup. The officials are also upset the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration did not respond fast enough to help in the crisis. The federal government is now coordinating the cleanup effort, which is being paid for by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` an environmentalist'' and added, `` This president is not going to let anyone off the hook.'' Asked if <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had done enough, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Exxon is clearly going to have to do more.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that his trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, his second foreign excursion since he became vice president, was worthwhile because it gave him a feel for a number of issues, including the situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and allowed him to make personal contact with leaders in those countries. He said he learned valuable information that will help him have input into policy decisions in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` I guarantee you what I learned on the trip ... will help make policy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s planned trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was a `` promising undertaking'' that could help efforts to dismantle communism in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had quizzed him about recent economic and political reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at a 45-minute White House meeting. `` The president took a good deal of interest in our assessment,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` agreed on the necessity that the West should in a careful approach lend a helping hand to promote the success'' of the Eastern European reforms. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intends to visit <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s neighbor, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July to underscore <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the reforms. On April 17, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced economic incentives to reward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for steps taken toward democracy and to encourage further political and economic reforms. The package included asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lower tariffs on certain Polish imports and seeking congressional approval of U.S.-guaranteed loans to stimulate private investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, a neutral nation bordering the Soviet bloc, has been at the forefront of encouraging reform in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit, <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said, `` is a promising undertaking If this visit could lead to a deeper conviction on both sides that ending communism should be a goal to be strived for, ... it is very welcome from our point of view.'' The chancellor, who heads <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the country's coalition government, said the removal this week of a barbed wire fence on the Austrian-Hungarian border was `` a very significant step'' signaling <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s intention to remove all barriers between it and the West. <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said he had assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that although <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> was considering joining the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, this `` will not dilute her position of neutrality.'' Under the 1955 State Treaty approved by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> vowed to maintain neutrality to win the withdrawal of the allied forces which occupied the country because of its association with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II. The chancellor told reporters that the necessary Austrian political decisions will be made soon so that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> application can be made `` in the course of this year, probably.''

<HEAD>Conference Calls for End to Ozone-Depleting Substances</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Delegates from 81 countries closed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conference Friday with a pledge to end by the year 2000 the production and use of chemicals that are rapidly destroying the Earth's ozone layer. The <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> delegates, who represented most of the world's population, also agreed to set up a system to help Third World countries pay to replace equipment or Western-imported consumer products that emit the chemicals But they left open how much aid will be involved, how the industrial countries will finance it, and who will control it. Scientists at the four-day meeting said ozone was being lost much more quickly than envisioned in 1987, when leading producers of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, agreed in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to cut emissions in half by 1999. However, <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, director of the U.N. Environment Program, told delegates in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> that the situation represents `` an environmental time-bomb.'' CFCs are most commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosols and cleaning materials for the metal and electronics industries. When they rise into the atmosphere, they damage the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles up that blocks some of the sun's ultaviolet rays. Scientists say the extra radiation increases cases of skin cancer and eye disease and damages smaller plants and animals crucial to the natural food chain. Delegates in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> unanimously adopted their declaration to phase out the production and consumption of CFCs worldwide by the year 2000. Included in the accord was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's largest producer of CFCs It makes nearly 40 percent of the chemicals and consumes about 30 percent. The delegates also said they would phase out halons, which are ozone-destroying gases used in sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers. They gave no target date. <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> told a news conference Friday that the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> meeting `` exceeded all expectations'' and succeeded in a `` translation of words into actions.'' But the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Declaration does not become legally binding unless it as adopted as an addendum to the Montreal Protocol. A follow-up meeting is scheduled in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next spring. The delegates in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> energetically debated proposals to set up the fund to help the developing countries conform to treaty requirements. Industrial countries argued that setting up a bureaucracy to oversee the fund could waste money better spent on aid. Developing countries said they wanted assurances that the fund would not take money from other aid projects like housing. Environmental groups, which were among more than 100 observers at the closed meetings, charged that the declaration was `` purposely kept vague on all major points.'' Representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said other hazardous chemicals should have been added to five CFCs and three halons to be cut in half under the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> pact. Scientists from industrial countries joined <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> in arguing that carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform, which are used in solvents, should be blacklisted. They said the chemicals have a much greater ozone-depleting potential than CFCs. Methyl chloroform is used in typewriter correction fluid. The two chemicals escaped the original ban because they are short-lived once released into the air. CFCs have an atmospheric life of up to 100 years.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> wants to appeal a federal court injunction barring sales of nearly 1 billion board feet of ancient timber in the national forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> where the spotted owl lives, according to a letter released by an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> lawmaker Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in a letter to Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, said he had `` requested that we appeal the judge's injunction.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has formally asked the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of general counsel to pursue the appeal, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers will review the request and make a recommendation to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which will make the final decision on whether to appeal, said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> declined to release a copy of the request <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had sent to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, adding that such requests do not have to be made public. In March, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> issued the injuction in a suit involving challenges to the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s spotted owl habitat management plan. Environmentalist charge the plan fails to set aside enough of the region's old-growth forests to ensure the survival of the owl and the timber industry has said that plan closes too many acres to logging. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s injunction covered more than 140 sales representing about one-fifth of the agency's planned sales program for this fiscal year. The judge has set a trial for June 13. About 2,000 breeding pairs of owls are thought to live almost exclusively in the old-growth forests of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Their fate has touched off a raging dispute between environmentalists and the region's timber industry. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 Israeli soldiers killed a 13-year-old Palestinian in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on Friday, and three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were wounded by a roadside bomb in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The boy's death raises to 461 the number of Palestinians killed in the 17-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Twenty Israelis also have been slain. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told Jews who survived an Arab knife attack that Israelis should make sure terrorists who assault civilians do not escape unharmed. An opposition legislator accused him of encouraging vigilantism. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> rejected the French government report on <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s meetings this week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist group and refuses to deal with it. An army spokesman said the boy was shot when he joined masked youths who were throwing stones and iron bars at an army observation post in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and arrived dead at an Arab hospital. He identified the victim as <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> and said the family took the body before army investigators could establish the exact cause of death. The spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> was arrested and freed on bail two weeks ago for taking part in a demonstration. Arab reporters identified the boy as <PERSON> Milad </PERSON> <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> and said he was building a roadblock when he was killed by a bullet to the chest. Doctors at <LOCATION> Mokassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said he was taken there and was pronounced dead on arrival. <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON>'s family took the body and tried to hold a funeral service in <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, across from the Church of the Nativity, but <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and police blocked the procession, the Arab reporters said. They said the boy was buried in neighboring <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> village and the funeral procession grew into a nationalist demonstration of more than 500 marchers. Dozens of masked youths waved <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and shouted: `` With our blood and souls we shall redeem our martyr!'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> hospital </LOCATION> sources said nine Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers Friday. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, three wounded <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. One has moderate injuries and two are lightly wounded, an army spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He said the attack occurred on the edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone, near the village of <LOCATION> Aramta </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Israeli artillery opened fire on militia positions close to where the attack took place. The army refused to confirm the incident, but <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported soldiers fired dozens of rounds. On Thursday, two members of the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia were killed by the detonation of a similar bomb near <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> village, four miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. Foreign reports say about 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the six-to-10-mile-wide buffer strip that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out when it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982. Israeli patrols are assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a mostly Christian force that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> arms. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday visited two victims of a Wednesday stabbing attack in which two elderly Jews were killed. `` I think the general public and the Jewish public must do their utmost in order to defend themselves and in order to prevent murderers from doing their deeds, and in order to prevent them from coming out unscathed if they succeed in doing something,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in remarks broadcast on radio stations. Legislator <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Oron </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> as criticizing <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> for calling on people to take the law into their own hands. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said the comments were meant to encourage cooperation with the police, not vigilante attacks. After Wednesday's attack, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> crowd chased, caught and beat the attacker, who was rescued by police. The assailant, <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Razak </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> el-Bireh </LOCATION>, appeared before a judge Friday and was ordered detained for another two weeks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said if the attack was carried out by the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, as the group claimed, then it was an act of terrorism. But <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the department spokeswoman, also said `` the motivation for this brutal attack is unclear at this time.'' She said everyone `` interested in peace should condemn this act ... an outrageous act.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the group was based primarily in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and was not part of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 Indian activist <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s attorney said Friday that his client stands no chance of a fair trial if he is extradited to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to faces charges of kidnapping 14 people at a newspaper office. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> told a news conference at the Hall of Justice that he will fight efforts by <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities to try <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> on state charges of kidnapping. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> said racism is rampant in the mostly rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, which has roughly equal numbers of whites, blacks and Indians. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31, appeared briefly in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but was ordered to return May 23 after <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> has a chance to review case documents and decide whether to pursue an appellate court stay of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s extradition or request a full hearing before <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> officially joined the case Friday morning. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and fellow Tuscarora Indian <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> were accused of holding hostages for 10 hours in the offices of The Robesonian Newspaper in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in February 1988. They said they were trying to draw attention to involvement by local law enforcement officials in drug trafficking. The two were tried and acquitted on federal charges but later charged by the state. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> said the state charges constitute double jeopardy. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> pleaded guilty Thursday to all 14 charges. He was sentenced to six years in prison, followed by a six-year suspended sentence and up to five years of probation. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> March 10 after unsuccessfully seeking asylum at the Soviet Consulate. His bail has been set at $ 1 million. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON>, who defended <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bobby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> and wrote the book `` Streetfighter in the Courtroom,'' said he would appeal to the governor's `` compassionate side and see if it works,'' as well as his `` Armenian sense of justice.'' The latter was a reference to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s history of genocide and racism at the hands of greater powers. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> is of Armenian descent and <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to Armenian immigrants named <PERSON> Garabedian </PERSON>. The attorney said he would present `` ample, reliable evidence'' of the alleged racism in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` The governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> could do us a great justice by keeping <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> here,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as he flanked <PERSON> Garry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pembroke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, attended the hearing and news conference, wearing a gray suit and white banner with red letters that read, `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> is my son.'' `` If the governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sends my son back, he might as well hold a gun to his head and pull the trigger,'' she said. The Rev. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the commission will lobby with the public on <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s behalf.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Reforms in FBI Promotion System; Declines to Order Quotas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Friday ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to reorganize what he called an `` excessively subjective'' promotion system that resulted in discrimination against Hispanic agents. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> refused to make the agency adopt ethnic promotion quotas, saying the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can take other steps to make sure Hispanics get the experience they need for career advancement. `` The imposition of quotas or preferential promotion are drastic remedies which should be ordered only upon a showing that the discriminating employer has resisted less intrusive reforms,'' <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> said, ruling on a discrimination suit brought by 311 Hispanic agents. Up to 200 Hispanic agents could be eligible for promotion under the ordered reforms. And federal officials have said <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s order could affect how other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies promote and assign employees. The judge also reinforced the power of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s national career board and stripped local <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents-in-charge of the power to override board decisions. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` Mat'' Perez of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, who filed the lawsuit in 1987, hailed <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s order as the end of an arbitrary and unfair system of promotion. `` We have cracked the case,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-ranking Hispanic agent `` We have broken the good old boy network. Today it -LRB- a fairer system -RRB- is going to start.'' <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> rejected the agents' request for back pay and extra compensation for tedious duties they do disproportionately, such as listening to Spanish-language wiretaps. However, plaintiffs' attorney <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> stressed that the plaintiffs were n't after money. `` All of the agents have told me that if it was one cent or $ 10 million, they would trade it all to stop discrimination within the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. `` What we were after in this case was the rightful place of these agents and to eradicate discrimination, and we believe the judge has done that. `` What the judge has done is change the bureau in a way that will benefit all agents. It makes the bureau a better place for everyone _ male, female _ regardless of ethnicity.'' `` We are looking with care at Judge <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s ruling with an eye toward building further on the many improvements already undertaken in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s personnel practices,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said in a statement. The judge acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has `` taken significant steps'' to curb discrimination since his initial ruling against it in September, but said they were not enough. Among the reforms <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ordered is appointment of a three-member panel to review plaintiffs' claims that they were denied promotions because of discrimination. Of the agents who joined the suit, 200 are eligible for the special promotion review, based on thir seniority and career status. Hispanics make up less than 5 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 9,000 agents. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also must record and transcribe proceedings of its career board, a standing body that evaluates promotions. In stripping <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents-in-charge of the ability to disregard career board recommendations, the judge called the practice an `` anathema to nearly every reform advanced by the bureau.'' The agency must `` improve the fairness and reviewability of an excessively subjective promotional process,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> filed the suit after a series of demotions dropped him from agent-in-charge in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, to the No. 2 spot in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. He claimed the demotions were based on his ethnic heritage, while the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> cited investigative and administrative problems. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> promoted to the next job level in the bureau within 45 days and said Sessions must report to the court every 90 days on promotional decisions regarding <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> until the agent becomes an agent-in-charge or is named to a job with similar responsibilities.

<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 5.37 billion more in consumer debt than they paid off in March, roughly matching February's rate of growth despite a big dropoff in borrowing for cars, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.4 percent in March, off slightly from the revised 9.5 percent pace of advance in February. For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent. Consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the economy's health because it represents two-thirds of all economic activity. The economy has showed signs of slowing in recent months in response to a campaign by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to restrain growth and ease inflationary pressures by pushing up interest rates. Economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the strong credit figures were at odds with a stream of government reports pointing toward a slowdown, and did n't accurately reflect the health of economy Car loans, heavily affected by rising interest rates, grew by $ 953 million in March, a 4 percent annual rate of growth. That was down sharply from growth of $ 2.39 billion in February, when the annual growth rate was 10 percent. Auto sales have been weak this year as business dropped off under the weight of higher interest rates and slackening demand after earlier strong sales. Automakers in recent weeks have launched a new round of incentives in hopes of luring customers back into showrooms for the crucial spring selling season. The category of debt that includes credit cards surged by $ 4.3 billion in March, a strong 28.9 percent annual rate of increase, up from a 12.6 percent pace in the previous month. Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said the figure was not to be trusted, given another government report showing retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in March and other signs that consumer spending is slowing down. Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by $ 1.78 billion in March, an 11 percent rate of growth, up from a 7.3 percent rate of advance in February. Mobile home debts, meanwhile, dropped $ 1.67 billion, a huge 76.9 percent annual rate of decline. Analysts said the decrease reflected a shift of debt into the category of bank loans rather than an actual dropoff in borrowing for mobile homes. The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally adjusted $ 692.77 billion in March.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is standing by his appointments of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> to key ambassadorships despite congressional roadblocks over questions about their roles in the Iran-Contra affair, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` The president feels both of those nominations are very important to carrying out the policies of the government in the areas in which he has asked them to serve. He is very proud of both appointments and thinks they are outstanding men who should be confirmed,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president, has been nominated as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> ambassador when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president, has been tapped as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's emissary to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> attended a White House celebration of <LOCATION> Cinco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, a Mexican holiday, and was warmly introduced by the president as the next ambassador. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also told reporters the president has not discussed the question of whether to pardon <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> after the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's conviction Thursday on three felony counts in connection with the Iran-Contra case. In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called North a hero and said he hoped the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer would be acquitted. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused any further comment on the North verdict or trial documents that suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was involved in a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration plan to make a quid-pro-quo arrangement with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for its assistance to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But when asked if trial documents, which have caused some lawmakers to express reservations about <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, might influence <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to back away from the nominations, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated that would not be the case. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> subcommittee, is said to have asked Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to reconsider <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s nomination because trial materials raised doubts about <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s past assertions that he did nothing illegal or improper in his contacts with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other Iran-contra figures <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s relationship with <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a key figure in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s private aid network to help the Contras during the congressional ban on aid, was a controversial topic throughout the Iran-Contra investigations. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> has repeatedly bolstered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s assertion that as vice president he did not know the extent of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s clandestine efforts <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing is scheduled for next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> delayed a vote on <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>'s nomination last month after some Democratic senators requested more time to review whether as ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> he was involved in a quid pro quo arrangement to entice <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to help the rebels <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, has cited a cable from <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> as proof that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not engage in a discussion of such arrangements for the Contras when he met with Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> in early 1985. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the appropriate congressional committees would be briefed on confidential cables that described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s activities in that regard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday denied being involved in any quid pro quo arrangement nd denied knowing of any such effort by others in the administration. Documents from the North trial had <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> meeting at a time when internal <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration memos suggested a plan in which continuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Latin American countries would be linked to assistance for the rebels. The document never asserted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> discussed a quid pro quo arrangement with <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>. But it said he explained to the Hondurans that they were to receive a great deal more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and other aid _ aid that the document said was part of a deal approved by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The investigation of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s commodity exchanges is narrower than a probe of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets but focuses on fundamental trading practices common to both operations, officials said Friday. Federal agents raided the headquarters of four futures markets in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on Thursday, seizing documents from at least one firm, subpoenaing traders and sending shudders through the frenetic trading pits. But officials close to the investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> attorney's office said they were focusing on allegations of price fixing and other practices by a few individual traders and not the exchanges at large. They said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was not involved, unlike a separate two-year undercover probe in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> where agents infiltrated commodities pits and secretly tape-recorded traders. `` It's not something that hits out at you and goes boom, boom, boom,'' one market official who asked not to be named said of the trading practices being studied in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodity markets, subpoenaed trading and broker records from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, plus at least six individual traders. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s civil probe is examining activities of more than 50 traders over the past two years. An official said the subpoenas request information detailing disciplinary action, personal bank accounts and about leasing expensive and hard-to-get memberships to non-members. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> executed two criminal search warrants at the offices of <ORGANIZATION> MBF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a prominent trader on all four exchanges who was disciplined in 1985 for trading violations. `` I'd say he -LRB- <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> -RRB- is one of the focuses of it. We're certainly not limiting the case to just him,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Inspector <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosterman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client was cooperating with the government and had done nothing wrong. Officials confirmed reports that the scrutiny included pre-arranged trading, in which dealers agree to fix prices beforehand, and trades conducted to skirt tax losses or defer income. Critics consider the futures markets prone to fraudulent activity partly because of the volatile, split-second atmosphere in which trading is conducted. Screaming traders wearing brightly colored coats use hand signals and shouts to coordinate buying and selling of futures contracts on commodities from oil to orange juice. Dealers and investors make money by speculating on the future prices of the commodities. Other violations may have occurred in a practice known as `` front-running,'' whereby traders execute trades for their own accounts before those of customers. Traders legally are allowed to trade for both themselves and their customers but that practice, known as dual trading, has been widely criticized as a possible source of abuses. While no indictments have been announced, the criminal probe of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> markets, which are the nation's largest, reportedly has involved more than 200 subpoenas and threats of racketeering prosecutions. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, meanwhile, exchange seats were selling for about $ 335,000 Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> after plunging from $ 350,000 to as little as $ 285,000 Thursday after the probe was disclosed. Analysts said a similar pattern followed news in January of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> probe, and seats there now are selling at record highs.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> opposes a plan that would require <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to decide soon whether to modernize tactical nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said Friday. The plan by the Canadian government is a compromise aimed at breaking a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> deadlock that has pitted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose support at home is rapidly eroding, is insisting that the superpowers hold talks soon on reducing short-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, most of which are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to postpone until 1992 whether to modernize the missile fleet to give the rockets greater range. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had a 30-minute telephone conversation with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday. The two leaders discussed the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> rift, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to early talks on the missiles remains firm, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We still believe early talks would be a mistake,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Discussions that would lead to a ... denuclearization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would not be welcome.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the telephone conversation was initiated by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. He would not give further details. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has proposed that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agree to the modernization and that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in turn show its willingness to take up negotiations on short-range weapons with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, asked his view of that idea during an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s position `` is that a decision not be moved up on whether or not we need a replacement -LRB- for the missiles -RRB- but that it be made at the right point in time, namely 1992.'' A government official insisted that <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> did not mean <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was rejecting any proposed solutions to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> feud. `` This has been stated before, that we do n't think there should be a decision on replacing the missiles before it is necessary,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonyity. He said the government would not be giving its official position on any suggested compromises, but they would be discussed privately among the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners. `` Discussions are already under way -LRB- within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and every proposal will be examined. Anything is possible,'' said the official. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say taking up negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons now could leave the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> vulnerable to the superior conventional forces of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. Both nations say they want to see more progress on reducing conventional weapons during talks being held in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> says <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not pass up opportunities to hold talks with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact bloc on any weapons systems, and that the time is right to begin negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons. The West Germans also say no decision is necessary on replacing the Lance missiles until 1992 because the rockets are not yet out of date. Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 88 Lance missile launchers are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has repeatedly stressed that his country should have a `` special weight'' in alliance discussions about the future of those arsenals. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ciriaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> on Friday endorsed the government's support for negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons if there is significant progress in East-West talks on conventional forces. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> generally sides with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute, giving its qualified support for talks to reduce the weapons and saying it does not believe there is an urgent need to modernize the weapons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> says nearly half of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members support its position. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> met Wednesday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to discuss the issue.

He and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, both 70, have been members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the 1940s. Until <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>'s release in November, both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement. Friday's meeting was their first since 1982, when <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was moved from <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> prison to the <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> penitentiary. <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> told journalists he had not expected to see <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> again because `` we were doing life. We only had hope that we would see each other in a free country.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released soon, <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> said, but `` he seemed in good health. From what we had heard he was very much improved.'' He said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> wore civilian clothes and no guards observed their meeting. The Heunis speech in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was a summary of proposals he and other government officials have mentioned in recent months. He said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks. No black leaders have accepted the government's invitation to constitutional negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected plans put forth by <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, but some moderates have indicated they would negotiate if the government freed <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, among others, and lifted bans on black opposition groups. Speculation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be freed after the Sept. 6 general elections increased with the <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> visit. Previous efforts to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leader's refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule

 <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of hitting it with a missile, and the communist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government countercharged on Friday that <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were preparing a chemical attack on an Afghan city. The official newspaper, The <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> Times, said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> summoned the Afghan charge d'affaires to protest that a Soviet-made SS-1 Scud missile hit a refugee camp inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Thursday, killing two people and wounding 14. However, local officials and witnesses said the blast was caused by a bomb dropped by one of two Afghan warplanes that flew about 70 miles into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> province. No explanation was made for the discrepancy. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are major backers of Afghan Moslem rebels who for the past 11 years have fought to topple the Soviet-backed <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime and establish an Islamic government. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the government denied the allegation and called it a plot by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to divert attention from the `` military aggression and internal interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' An Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman deflected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and rebel charges that communist troops were getting ready to use chemical weapons against guerrillas besieging the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. He said in a statement broadcast over official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> that instead, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were giving such internationally outlawed weapons to the guerrillas. The statement said <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was ready to welcome <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> experts `` in order to assess these baseless allegations. ... The Republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has acquired no chemical weapons of any type whatsoever. It does not, and will not seek to obtain such weapons, the use of which it considers a crime against humanity.'' Rebel commanders and some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have reported that troops defending <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> recently received gas masks and protective garb in preparation for the use of chemical weapons against the insurgents. The guerrillas have been attacking <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 42 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, since March 6. Soviet forces ended nine years of military intervention on the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> side on Feb. 15. The guerrillas reportedly are preparing new offensives around <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON>, the Moslem holy month of fasting, which ends next week.

<HEAD>Pirates Reportedly Slaughter 130 Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pirates attacked and set fire to a wooden boat carrying Vietnamese refugees, massacring about 130 people in a rampage of rape, gunfire, and clubbings, refugee officials said Friday. They said the attack took place in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the Malaysian coast on April 16, according to the only known survivor, who was piced up by another refugee boat after he floated for 29 hours. `` It is one of the worst incidents of piracy we have heard of,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> high commissioner for refugees in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Such attacks on refugees fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> have increased in number and viciousness recently. Two attacks in March left more than 100 people missing and presumed dead. Western officials say most pirates are Thais who roam the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the Gulf of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and waters near <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. In the latest violence, seven pirates armed with shotguns and hammers stormed the refugees' boat, raped several women and attacked people, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official in a telephone interview. Some of the boat people died of exhaustion after floating in the sea clinging to dead bodies of fellow refugees, said the official. The 22-year-old man who survived the April attack was identified as <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> Hung by refugee officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. He fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> April 14 on a motorized wooden boat with about 130 refugees, including 20 children, said a statement issued by the commission. Pirates from two boats boarded the refugee boat, shot and killed the vessel's two pilots and its mechanic and raped some, if not all, of the 15-20 women and girls as young as 12, the statement said. Then the pirates set the boat ablaze. `` In the ensuing panic, many refugees grabbed buoys and jerrycans and floats and plunged into the sea.'' The pirates `` used sticks to prevent refugees from clinging on floating objects. Those who resisted were shot at.'' <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> swam away from his boat, followed by another refugee who later lagged behind, according to the statement. About four hours later, <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> was swept back toward the refugee boat by ocean currents, it said. `` He met a woman who was holding on to two dead bodies in order to keep afloat. They then tied three dead bodies together with clothing to make a raft,'' it said. `` The woman held on to the raft while the witness clung to another dead body. They spent the night in this manner while the two pirate boats were still in close vicinity.'' The pair reportedly heard shouts around them during the night but could not locate other survivors. The next morning, they spotted a boy 12 or 13 years old clinging to a jerrycan. `` His jerrycan was later snatched away by another adult refugee,'' <PERSON> Pham </PERSON>'s account said. `` The witness passed a floating dead body to the boy to help him float but the boy died of exhaustion 10 minutes later.'' The pirate boats lingered several hours and <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> and the woman decided to swim away. But the woman was too exhausted and fell behind. <PERSON> Pham </PERSON> kept swimming, supporting himself on two wooden planks, and was rescued on the afternoon of April 17 by another refugee boat, according to the statement. They circled the scene of the attack and found debris and luggage floating, but no other survivors.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister ended talks with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials Friday without making any progress on a bitter dispute over the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. `` The northern territories have always belonged to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> alone,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told a news conference. `` Russians are entitled to believe they are entirely Russian,'' said Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON>, who addressed reporters after Uno. Completion of a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities between the two countries and a visit by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> both depend on resolution of the crisis. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> occupied the islands north of Hokkaido after the end of fighting in 1945 and have rejected Japanese demands to give them back. Both sides claim the islands belong to them historically and culturally. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Uno that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was using a double standard in pressing for the islands. In remarks carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> chief asked why <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does n't consider that its similar claims to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are obstacles to full-scale relations with those countries. `` There must be no room for a lopsided attitude to sovereign interests of states and the existing views of a people on some or other aspects of its relations with other peoples,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` Mutually observed balancing of interests is very important in bilateral relations. And it is also important to avoid ultimatums in posing some or other questions.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is improving relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, opening avenues to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and seeking to boost its trade with the booming economies of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION>. Many Japanese companies have operated for years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviets have pledged to remove 200,000 soldiers from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region as part of an overall reduction of their military force worldwide. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also blasted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for building up its military potential at a time when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is pursuing disarmament. Officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are pressing for a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit after the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> issue is settled, but <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said the Soviets insist `` there must be no preconditions on either side.'' `` The visit of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is on the political agenda and it will all depend on how we advance in our preparatory work,'' <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said. The Soviet president, in the remarks carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said a visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should be discussed early next year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s schedule this year is full, with a trip to Peking for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years scheduled next week, a trip to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in June, to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in July, and to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in fall. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said he would meet once again with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in September, and that he was confident the two sides eventually could work out an agreement. But he acknowledged that besides stepping up the work of a joint commission on the problem, neither side had tabled any compromise proposals during his visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which began April 30. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> said the Soviets were disappointed in Uno's reaction to their proposal to begin Soviet-U.S.-Japanese talks on disarmament in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. He said his country views such talks as a starting point for a broader disarmament discussion such as the one encompassing the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said modernization and increases in Soviet military forces `` makes us very apprehensive,'' and that `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces exist as a means of contributing to the stability of the region.''

 A juror in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial said Friday she had been using cocaine until `` three or four months'' before the trial, but she said it did not affect her work as a juror. `` That was months ago, months before I got on this trial,'' said <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 35, in a telephone interview.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman turned away questions Friday about a pardon for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> as jurors began to recount their thoughts after convicting <PERSON> North </PERSON> on three of 12 Iran-Contra felony charges. Of four jurors who commented publicly, three said <PERSON> North </PERSON> should go to prison for the crimes. One said, `` That's not for me to say.'' Jury foreman <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said she believed <PERSON> North </PERSON> got a fair trial, but she also said former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` should have been down there'' to testify `` because he knew a lot about what was going on.'' Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should have been compelled to testify, she added, `` Yes, I'm not leaving him out.'' North's lawyers unsuccessfully sought subpoenas for both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was vice president at the time of the events covered in the trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> will sentence North on June 23, with maximum possible penalties of 10 years in prison and $ 750,000 in fines. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, responding to questions on the subject of a pardon, said he had asked the president about it on Thursday. `` He said ` I have n't discussed it with anybody,''' the White House press secretary said. Pressed by reporters, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't want to speculate either way. ... There's been no discussion of a pardon whatsoever.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had in the past said that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, was a hero and had said he hoped the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide would be acquitted. But the president has repeatedly said he has not discussed the possibility of a pardon, and he showed irritation recently at a published report speculating on what he might do. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> preferred `` not to have any comment at this time'' on the verdicts. Documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> than earlier revealed concerning the solicitation of other countries' support for the Contras But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' president in early 1985, declared Thursday the meeting had not been part of any deal to provide <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> with expedited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid in return for help for the rebels. North, out of the public eye on Friday, said Thursday he would appeal and was confident of eventual vindication. Meanwhile, most of the jurors rested in private after the three-month trial and 12 days of deliberations. But four commented: _ Ms <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the 34-year-old foreman, said she saw the Iran-Contra issue as a political dispute, `` a war between the Democrats and the Republicans.'' And when asked if <PERSON> North </PERSON> had `` taken the heat'' for higher-ups, she said, `` That's my impression.'' But when asked if <PERSON> North </PERSON> should go to prison, she said, `` I think he should do some time.'' She said she was glad for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sake that in court `` he got up there and said something for himself.'' But she said he `` did n't really impress me that much. And she said she found the testimony of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s former secretary, <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, `` phony. ... I just did not appreciate her crying _ the way it seemed she had everything set up.'' _ <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 65, who served with General <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>'s 3rd Army during World War II, expressed sympathy for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who served on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White `` I think in my heart that he thought he was doing the right thing,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` And I think there were people higher who gave him authority to do a lot of things and then when he got caught out there high and dry, no one came to help him.'' At first he said it was `` not for me to say'' if <PERSON> North </PERSON> should go to prison. But when pressed, he said, `` I feel that if he's guilty he should go to jail, which he is, so. ...'' _ <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 35, said she helped persuade fellow jurors who wanted to acquit <PERSON> North </PERSON> on all counts that they could not find him innocent of actions he had admitted `` You got it from word of mouth that he knew it was against the law,'' she said. And she said he should serve time in prison. Yet, when asked if she considered North a hero, Miss <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, `` Yes, in some sense. He fought in the war. He tried to save hostages. He put himself out there.'' Later Friday, she said that she had been using cocaine until `` three or four months'' before the trial but that it did not affect her work as a juror. `` That was months ago, months before I got on this trial,'' she said in a telephone interview after first discussing her past drug use on <ORGANIZATION> WJLA </ORGANIZATION> television in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. _ <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 29, an electronics technician, said he doubted that all the facts in the Iran-Contra affair would ever come out and because `` a lot of lives were involved ... in some cases it's probably best that it is kept that way Asked if <PERSON> North </PERSON> should go to prison, he said, `` That's not for me to say.'' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Miss King and <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> spoke at their homes. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also was interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> as was <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. The jury found <PERSON> North </PERSON> guilty of accepting a $ 13,800 home security system from retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a co-defendant whom <PERSON> North </PERSON> had hired to run arms to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In addition, the jurors convicted North of destroying, altering or removing documents from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> said former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> told him to alter memos, but <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> North </PERSON> suggested the alteration. The jurors also found <PERSON> North </PERSON> guilty of aiding and abetting obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in November 1986 through the preparation of a false chronology regarding the arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that engulfed the White House in controversy during former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided to name <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as the senior <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, an administration source said Friday. In the job, <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> who has held several foreign postings, would be the chief White House official on a number of key foreign policy issues, including the Contra question in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and military support for Latin democracies such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> position, with the title of senior director, does not require congressional confirmation. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> appointment was confirmed by a source who declined to be identified. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> has been ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1986 and was the deputy assistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs from 1981 to 1982. In that <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post, he had a hand in shaping the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policies. He has also held diplomatic posts in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. In his early days in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> was embroiled in controversy when he accused by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commander of using his diplomatic assignment to conduct spying activities and of interfering with the country's internal affairs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied those charges. <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON> was appointed by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> post in the fall of 1986, serving there during the time when disclosures came out about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's clandestine efforts to aid the Contra rebels during the congressional ban on aid. Relations with the Hondurans were a key factor in the private Contra aid operation, with the Contras using <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a base of operations. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has adopted a non-military approach to the Contra issue, giving the rebel forces non-lethal aid until next February when elections will be held in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The Contra army is encamped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid is to be released also for repatriation for those who want to return to their homeland.

 The military said Friday that it seized communist rebel documents apparently calling for more killings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials starting in June, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said it carried out the attack because of purported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s counterinsurgency campaign The commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON>, said Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops will defend themselves if attacked but will avoid taking action that will put them in direct conflict with the rebels. `` Certainly, if we are under attack or if your life is threatened, you're going to take appropriate action,'' Hardisty, commander in chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at a breakfast meeting. `` But I will only think that would be the bottom line in any involvement. We certainly would not put ourselves, nor our commanders allowing our forces to be put in a situation, where there would be confrontation with the -LRB- rebels -RRB-.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the documents were seized Thursday.

<HEAD>Insurers Ready To Accept California Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Insurance company officials, freed by a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling from the prospect of mandatory rate rollbacks, said Friday they could adapt to the rest of an insurance initiative passed by voters last fall. The court's ruling Thursday upheld most of Proposition 103, a consumer-sponsored initiative that gives the state greater control over insurers. But the court rejected parts of the initiative that called for mandatory rollbacks and a one-year freeze of auto, property and liability rates at 20 percent below November 1987 levels. `` A lot of industry fears have been relieved, because it appears the court understands what constitutes a reasonable return'' on investment, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group. `` We think we can live with it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. Many of the same companies had theatened to quit the lucrative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market after passage of Proposition 103, the farthest-reaching of five insurance-related initiatives on last November's ballot. State Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> blocked companies from leaving in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, citing Proposition 103's ban on arbitrarily refusing to renew auto insurance policies and a state law requiring a withdrawing insurer to arrange substitute coverage. Thursday's ruling broadens insurers' exemptions from the proposed rate rollback and appears to allow current rate-setting practices to continue through November, unless the insurance commissioner intervenes. The conservative court ruled that the Proposition 103 was too narrow in excusing insurers from the rollback and freeze only if they could prove a `` substantial threat of insolvency.'' Constitutional guarantees of property rights require a `` fair rate of return,'' the justices said; in addition, insurers who apply for exemptions from the rollback can continue to set their own rates, subject to a later decision by <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> on whether the amounts are more than necessary for a fair return. Starting in November any rate increase will need advance approval from the insurance commissioner, who is currently appointed by the governor but under Proposition 103 will become an elected official after 1990. Although most companies have not yet indicated whether they intend to seek such exemptions, virtually all the insurers are expected to do so. `` We already justify rates in a number of states across the country, and we can do that in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Safeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It should be an easy job.'' `` It should be the end of sky-high, take-it-or-leave-it rate increases,'' countered Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, who opposed Proposition 103 on the ballot but defended it in court. Consumer activists who sponsored the measure promised to monitor <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s enforcement efforts and use their new rights under the law to gain access to insurers' financial records. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, an appointee of Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, is a former insurance executive. The initiative also restricts non-renewal of auto insurance policies and the use of geography in rate-setting, and establishes antitrust liability for collusion by insurers.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have provided more than two-thirds of the arms used by the country's leftist guerrillas, who would wither as a fighting force without such support, the military said Friday Col. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, the head of the joint chiefs of staff, called for linking the issues of cutting off arms to the Salvadoran insurgents and demobilizing U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. This would `` make the pacification process truly regional,'' he said in an interview. A regional peace process began in August 1987, when five Central American presidents signed a peace accord known as <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II that called for ending civil wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. `` As it is now, it appears the only objective of <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> II is to dismantle the Contras and consolidate the Sandinista government'' in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s rightist president-elect, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, echoed <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>'s claims Friday during a news conference in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. He said the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> `` recently received new arms from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and I do n't think this indicates the Sandinista government wants peace,'' he said <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who takes over June 1 as head of this country's U.S.-backed government, said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is the main obstacle to regional peace He was in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to discuss the next regional summit with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts toward regional peace. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> spoke in the joint chiefs briefing room next to an array of 30 Soviet-bloc weapons _ AK-47 assault rifles, <PERSON> Dragunov </PERSON> sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and submachine guns. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said the weapons were among 60 East-bloc arms captured from insurgent forces this year. He said 70 percent of rebel weapons come from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said arms shipments to rebel forces increased beginning last September. Army intelligence now figures 1,000 AKs have entered the country in recent months. The rebels says they capture the vast majority of their arms and munitions from government soldiers. They maintain offices in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> but deny receiving anything but moral and diplomatic support from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Rebel leaders interviewed in their northern strongholds say they have bought Soviet-bloc weapons, including several hundred AK-47s, since late last year. They say the weapons came from Contra rebel camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` Some Contras may have sold their weapons on the black market, and the -LRB- Salvadoran -RRB- subversives may have obtained some of them that way. But not 1,000,'' <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> sends arms to Salvadoran rebels by land and sea in shipments of about 50 rifles at a time. The land routes include a stretch through Honduran territory along the mountainous border with <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> said that without outside support, the rebels would lose their military strength and would have to resort to terrorism. He said small Nicaraguan vessels, ostensibly fishing craft, deliver arms to guerrillas at several points along <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast But he acknowledged that no vessel has been caught transporting such weapons. More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed in the country's eight-year civil war.

 Prosecutors said Friday they were holding three men for questioning about the killings of two independence leaders in this French <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory. Police say <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> were shot to death Thursday on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Djubelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wea </PERSON>, a separatist opposed to <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s moderate policies. <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON>'s bodyguards killed <PERSON> Wea </PERSON> after the attack. Witnesses said other gunmen were involved. Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said he would fly to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> for the funeral Sunday of Tjibaou, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON>, his chief aide. <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> said New Caledonian elections planned for June 11 would be postponed because they would interfere with the traditional period of mourning. No new date was announced. Prosecutors identified those held as <PERSON> Paoula </PERSON> <PERSON> Wea </PERSON>, a nephew of Djubelly Wea; <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Tangopi </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Fessen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tangopi </PERSON> was reported wounded in the exchange of gunfire and was under police guard in the hospital at <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. The senior surviving leader of the front, <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, said the group would continue participating in a `` peace process'' that began last year and is to culminate in a 1998 referendum on independence. `` The word of <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> will be respected, and we pledge to make sure that the process is followed to its conclusion,'' he said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>: `` All Australians will join right-minded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> in deploring this shocking act of violence. <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> was an inspiration to his people and one of the great apostles of moderation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s recent troubled history.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> called <PERSON> Tjibaou </PERSON> `` a man of conviction and vision. All those of us who met him and knew him were impressed by his courage and purposeful moderation.'' <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, a witness to the killings, said he thought at least five or six gunmen were involved. His organization canceled ceremonies on the first anniversary of an assault by French military police May 5, 1988, on a cave where separatists were holding more than 20 other officers hostage. Nineteen hostage-takers and two policemen were killed. Tjibaou, <PERSON> Yeiwene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> for the ceremonies when the shooting occurred. Native Melanesians known as Kanaks make up 43 percent of the people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>, a group of islands 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and most favor independence. Nearly all European settlers and descendants of settlers, 37 percent of the population, want the islands to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The rest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION>'s residents, Polynesians and Asians, also generally favor staying with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Melanesian population is growing much faster than the others and is expected to regain the majority early in the next century.

 More than 20,000 copper workers from the official trade union alliance and from Solidarity have gone on strike at four mines in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to demand higher pay, an activist said Friday. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON>, a local Solidarity activist, said the miners were demanding a 50 percent increase in pay.

He said they remained on the surface of the pits and were carrying out maintenance underground. The strikers handed over a list of demands, all of which concerned pay, and they were rejected by management, <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON> said. Solidarity was legalized April 17 after a seven-year ban as a result of agreements reached between the opposition and communist authorities at round-table talks.

 The robot <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe streaked on a near-perfect path toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> on Friday while Atlantis' astronauts melted metal and did other routine tests in orbit The astronauts' work load was light because the heavy weight of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> and its rocket booster, totaling 45,000 pounds, had restricted the amount of experiments they could carry for the four-day mission. Conversation from the astronauts also was light as they methodically went about their work, talking only sparingly with controllers on the ground. The 7,600-pound <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, launched late Thursday, was more than 175,000 miles from the shuttle by late Friday afternoon and zipping deeper into space, its systems operating perfectly, officials said. It still had about 158 million miles to go. Barreling along initially at 25,000 mph, the craft slowed gradually to a cruising speed of about 7,000 mph. When it reaches its target in August 1990, the tug of Venusian gravity will have increased the speed again to about 25,000 mph. The spacecraft was in excellent condition and on a course that was only .5 of a degree off normal, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Such a deviation was expected, they said, and on May 21, a ground station will send a signal to trigger a small motor firing to adjust the path. `` The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are operational and nominal. It could n't be better,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerpheide </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project manager, said a few hours after the probe was launched. `` It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the rebirth of the planetary program.'' <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary mission in 11 years and the first ever launched from a space shuttle. Mission Control in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> awakened the astronauts Friday for their first full day in space with the theme music from the movie `` Superman.'' `` Good morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> communicator <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>. `` Good morning, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' commander <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> replied. `` We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our toothbrushes.'' Afterward, the astronauts worked with a 128-pound metals-processing furnace the size of a small microwave oven. They also brought along medical experiments and several cameras for photographing the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and night lightning strikes in the clouds below. The crew was melting and resolidifying small samples of indium and selenium in the furnace to see how they react in weightlessness. Potential applications for such space-made materials include advanced electronic and optical devices. The astronauts reported one melting indium sample may have been affected by vibrations when <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> briefly fired the shuttle's steering thrusters in a test for the Strategic Defensive Initiative, the so-called Star Wars plan to build a missile defense system Tracking devices in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> recorded the firings to help SDI engineers better understand the characteristics of ignitions in space. Flight director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittemore </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> it was not certain the sample was bothered by the vibrations. He reported Atlantis' systems were in excellent condition and the only problems were `` just annoyances.'' He said a facsimile machine being tested for sending documents to the shuttle was shut down when its paper jammed and that a machine for measuring blood pressure in the jugular system failed. Mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> released <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> from the cargo bay by remote control late Thursday, slightly more than six hours after Atlantis blasted into orbit from Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, two bursts from an on-board rocket propelled the robot on the start of the $ 550 million mission to map the surface of cloud-shrouded <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> with a high resolution radar system. <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> is 158 million miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, looping 1 -LCB- times around the sun, will travel 806 million miles to reach its destination. The probe's radar is to map up to 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Venusian </LOCATION> surface during a 243-day orbital period. The images, enhanced by computers, are expected to show features as small as a football field; that would be 10 times clearer than pictures obtained by earlier spacecraft. The pictures could tell scientists much about the history of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and how it evolved so differently from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, although both were believed to be nearly identical at the beginning of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago. Atlantis is to return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Monday, landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 12:43 p.m. PDT. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialist <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders announced Friday that private farming will be expanded and land will be leased to farmers for up to 50 years, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the measures were in a Politburo report presented by party chief <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> at a two-day <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on agricultural policy that ended Friday. The agency also indicated there was disagreement over policy on food prices. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Stoyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovcharov </PERSON>, the economics and planning minister, as telling the committee a new pricing system is needed to stimulate production, but said nothing of agreement on such a policy. As in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which recently adopted similar farming reforms, orthodox Communists worry that food prices might climb rapidly if government purchase prices are raised and private farmers produce more food. Privately cultivated plots account for only 13 percent of the land farmed in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, but yields almost one-third of total milk production, about 40 percent of meat and 50 percent of the eggs produced. Economic reformers argue that agriculture should be allowed freer rein to develop.

 The new incarnation of `` the loneliest repairman in town'' introduced himself to <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers Friday, when officials marked 40 years of making washing machines and other appliances at their plant here. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jump </PERSON>, an actor best known for his portrayal of the bumbling station manager <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> in the defunct television series `` WKRP in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>,'' is the new `` Ol' Lonely'' repairman in Maytag commercials. `` I have a <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> washer and dryer in our home. I could not be more proud to represent any product or group of people,'' Jump told workers at <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>'s Plant No. 2. Jump, 56, succeeded actor <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> in March as the Lonely Repairman in March. White spent 21 years as the character devised to promote a product the company said was so dependable the service department rarely was called. He is now a <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> consultant. Plant No. 2 started production on April 4, 1949. Since then, its workforce has grown from about 450 employees to about 2,500, and it has produced about 42 million automatic washing machines and other appliances, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Krajnovich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations director. <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION>, one of the units of the more than $ 3 billion <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also employs an additional 1,000 people in another <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> location. Before Plant No. 2 and its automatic products, <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> had been making wringer washing machines and other appliances for about 40 years. `` I remember when most of the plant was just dirt floor. The construction people actually outnumbered the <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> employees,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lister </PERSON>, who joined the company in March 1949. `` We had hopes it would continue to expand, but none of us could foresee this kind of growth,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Provin </PERSON>, an engineer who joined <ORGANIZATION> Maytag </ORGANIZATION> in January 1942 and will retire in December. `` It's been a super good place to work.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations opened negotiations on conventional weapons Friday by pressing for superpower talks on nuclear arms, jumping into a dispute that has split the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. East German Ambassador <PERSON> Klaus-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> warned that failure to hold talks on short-range nuclear weapons could `` have negative effects'' on the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations. He said negotiations on tactical nuclear rockets are vital for East and West Germans. `` The way these weapons are stationed today, it would be above all the citizens of both German states who would be the victim of their use,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said all the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc diplomats who addressed Friday's meeting insisted that a set of `` parallel negotiations'' be held on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> suggested the Soviet-led alliance was using the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks, which are to focus strictly on non-nuclear weapons, to play upon <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s internal bickering over the nuclear issue. `` I suspect that they know that there's a certain amount of discussion in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> camp,'' he said. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose popularity is crumbling at home, has insisted that superpower talks begin soon on short-range nuclear weapons. He also has asked <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to delay a decision on whether to modernize the missiles until after elections are held next year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> want the weapons upgraded quickly and reject talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range missiles. They argue that the missiles are necessary because of Soviet superiority in conventional forces. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that work on conventional force reductions is complex, but `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies are, however, encouraged by the seriousness with which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies have entered into this negotiation. `` What is needed now is for them to join <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> in exchanges that are frank and constructive and enhance the chances for success,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a statement. Ernst and Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> said that the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations see talks on short-range nuclear weapons and naval forces as part of overall efforts to reduce arms and increase security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The issue is sensitive in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where many are attracted to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s conciliatory gestures to the West, but especially so in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where most of the missiles are based. But <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said all parties agreed that the current round of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks, a resumption of negotiations that began March 9, are to focus solely on conventional weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> estimates the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has more than a 2-1 advantage in artillery and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and far more troops than the West. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> argues that even unilateral cuts announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last year will not alter the balance significantly. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced in December that 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks would pull out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by 1991. The withdrawals began last week in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with the departure of 31 T-64 tanks. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> said that further unilateral cuts by the various <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies mean that, by 1991, the Soviet bloc will cut its troops by 581,300 men, 12,751 tanks, 10,030 artillery systems, 1,010 combat aircraft, 895 armored vehicles and 30 `` nuclear systems.'' <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> used Friday's session to outline a plan dividing the zone covered by the talks _ from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains deep inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ into smaller regions. He said the sides should work to agree on overall totals for the number of men and weapons each military bloc can possess, but also agree on totals for each region. But <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> failed to provide any weapons ceilings. <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said such totals were vital for progress at the talks. At the previous round of talks that ended March 22, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact outlined plans for reducing troops and weapons 10 percent to 15 percent below present levels by 1994, a further 25 percent by 1997 and moving to completely defensive forces by the year 2000. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> presented a more specific proposal for ceilings on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down New Abortion Law For Single Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAVARES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new abortion consent law for single girls under 18 has been declared unconstitutional by a judge who asked a higher court to clarify the statute. Judge <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> said the law was so vague he was unable to hold a proper hearing on a petition by a 15-year-old girl who is 11 weeks pregnant and wants an abortion without her parents' consent. Before the new law was passed last year, unmarried girls under 18 could obtain abortions without consent from parents or the courts. The new law requires them to obtain permission from a parent or guardian; if they are unwilling to approach them, they may file a petition in circuit court. But the new law and rules of procedure adopted early this year force judges to `` rubber stamp'' teen-agers' claims, <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> said Thursday. The law requires judges to rule within 48 hours after a girl files a petition. If a judge does not rule by then, the girl is free to proceed with the abortion. The matter has to be secret, and neither the judge nor the state is allowed to call in testimony from anyone other than the girl. A judge must grant the request if any one of these conditions are met: _ The girl is sufficiently mature to make the decision _ Consent for the abortion is being `` unreasonably withheld'' by the parents or guardian _ The girl has presented `` facts that justify the fear of physical or emotional abuse'' if she requests help from her parents or guardians _ `` Any other good cause'' is presented. `` The law is too vague,'' the judge said. `` I want the court to tell me how to determine if a girl is mature enough to make this decision.'' The case was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. If that court does not act in 10 days, the girl can proceed with an abortion. <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> said the law and the rules do not give the court, or anyone who wants to intervene, the right or the time to hold a proper hearing on the claims in the petition. In this case, the judge appointed attorney <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boylston </ORGANIZATION> as a one-time guardian for the fetus and allowed him to argue the constitutionality of the statute and the rules. <PERSON> Boylston </PERSON> refused to comment except to say he agrees that the law needs to be more detailed. The girl was represented by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who said she would prefer to have more specific rules she could use in petition hearings. The judge said the higher court or the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> should revise the law to assist judges. `` Even if it was some sort of a checklist _ something that says you have to find this and this and this _ that would be better than what we have,'' <PERSON> Lockett </PERSON> said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> professor filed criminal charges against four fraternity students who dressed as terrorists and staged a mock kidnapping in her classroom. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said Friday she brought the felony charges because she felt the university's decision to put the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> fraternity on probation for at least one year was too light. `` My goal was n't to put these kids in prison,'' <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` My goal is to give them a sense of accountability and acceptable behavior and hope it would never, ever happen again in a classroom.'' <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> was teaching a nursing class on death and dying Dec. 7 when four men dressed as terrorists and carrying toy assault weapons and a toy handgun allegedly burst into the room and kidnapped a sorority president. The young woman willingly went with them after the fraternity members spoke to her in Greek, said Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> of the campus police. `` As they were leaving, the man with the handgun turned around, about 10 feet from the instructor, and pulled the trigger,'' he said. `` It made a popping sound.'' For at least a decade, sorority presidents have been kidnapped and ransomed for food, which is donated to a local charity, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougan </PERSON>, assistant vice president for campus life. `` It was a philanthropic event, and this is a miscarriage of justice,'' said one of the students arrested, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennoyer </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is the current fraternity president. `` We did n't do a thing to her -LRB- <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> -RRB-. We came in and took a student who knew we were coming. It's totally ridiculous.'' The teacher filed a complaint with campus police March 2 after the university reported its disciplinary decision. The four students, <PERSON> Pennoyer </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 20, both of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> DaSilva </PERSON>, 23, <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miga </PERSON>, 19, <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON>, were arrested and arraigned Thursday on charges of felony assault by use of devices similar in appearance to a firearm. The charge carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison in this case, since no serious injury occurred. The students were released on personal recognizance. A felony screening date of June 7 was set, at which time the campus police will turn the matter over to the attorney general's office. The state office has not decided whether to pursue the charges, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>, an associate professor of nursing, said the four were `` dressed like terrorists,'' and she had no idea the incident was part of a fund-raiser. `` I said, ` Get out of this room. Get out of this classroom,' `` <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON> said. `` I was more or less in shock. `` It's not an acceptable way to raise money for the poor. Using violence and terrorism to achieve a good just is n't appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Haggerty </PERSON>, who maintains she did not know the weapons were fake. <PERSON> Dougan </PERSON> said he felt the university's probation of the fraternity was sufficient. The fraternity `` was extremely cooperative, they apologized, they were extremely embarrassed. Certainly their intention was not to disrupt or upset individuals in the classroom. It's the strongest punishment I can give a fraternity short of closing the chapter.''

 Kidnappers freed two West Germans on Friday after holding them overnight but were holding a third hostage in connection with the trial of a Lebanese hijacker in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas said. There was no independent confirmation of the reported abductions, and the guerrillas did not identify the alleged kidnappers. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> noted that two of the alleged victims also disappeared briefly in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> a year ago. He said he found their latest 10-hour disappearance `` a bit strange.'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Wajih </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s military police in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, 48, <PERSON> Petra </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 25, were abducted Thursday evening by five gunmen outside <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. All three work for the ASME-Humanitas relief agency from an office near the southern port city. The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which controls the area around <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON>, an administrator at ASME-Humanitas, and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON>, a nurse, were freed at 5 a.m. The two met briefly with the militia's leader, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, at his office in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Reporters were kept out of the meeting and were not allowed to speak to either of the West Germans. They hid their faces from photographers. Later, <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were driven to an ASME-Humanitas base. It was closed to reporters. `` The released two told me they are scared because the kidnappers have threatened to kill their colleague if they revealed any information about their abduction,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told reporters. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ASME-Humanitas </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dagmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nackunstz </PERSON> said the group could not confirm the abductions had taken place. She confirmed <PERSON> Struegib </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> work for the organization and said the group has a worker with the first name of <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but she refused to give any other details. A Palestinian officer in charge of security at the office where they work quoted <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was being held in connection with the case of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem on trial for murder and air piracy in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. The officer, Lt. <PERSON> Maarouf </PERSON>, who uses just one name, did not say if any demands had been made. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION>, a West German television network, said the kidnappers `` apparently'' gave the freed histages `` a statement with their demands,'' which included a light sentence for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. It identified the man still held as <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Quint </PERSON>, 24, who joined the relief team in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> only 10 days ago. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> faces life in prison if convicted in the June 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the murder of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, a passenger. He admitted taking part in the hijacking but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. In January 1987, shortly after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, West Germans <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They were eventually freed, and a group that claimed responsibility for the abductions said the releases were a gesture aimed at winning a lenient sentence for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The chief judge in <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial, <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON>, said the proceedings would not be influenced by any kidnapping. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> told reporters five gunmen in a BMW stopped the humanitarian workers' van and `` pointed automatic rifles at them and ordered the three to come out of the van quickly, and lie down spread-eagled.'' `` The gunmen bundled <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> in the trunk and forced the others to sit on their laps on the back seat of the <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION> and sped away toward the south,'' he added. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nasserite </ORGANIZATION> militiamen manning a checkpoint on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southern edge fired at the car `` because the driver did not stop ... The vehicle's left-side mirror was hit, but the driver continued.'' He said <PERSON> Struebig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were released outside <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> and took a cab to their base. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was in `` constant contact with us by telephone to inquire about efforts to resolve the kidnapping issue.'' He did not elaborate. Fifteen foreigners are held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s elder brother, <PERSON> Abdul-Hadi </PERSON>, heads the security apparatus for the Iranian-backed extremist group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the umbrella for underground pro-Iranian factions holding most of the captives. Another <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the kidnappings of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. In April 1988, <PERSON> Steubig </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Schnitzler </PERSON> were thought to have been kidnapped after they disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for two days. ASMA-Humanitas later said they had not been taken hostage. It said a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their disappearance apologized to the two after discovering their identities and sheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area.

The opposition has hinted it may call supporters into the streets or call a general strike if evidence of fraud surfaces after the elections. `` We have n't the slightest faith in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said at a news conference Friday, `` The process of democratization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been very slow, and that is one of the reasons we decided to come here to monitor the elections.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and former Panamanian strongman Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> in 1977 signed the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, which give full control of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> arrived Thursday night as part of an invited delegation headed by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> under the auspices of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is chairman of the private council. No immediate government reaction came to Friday's announcement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sending an official delegation of 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observers headed by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa., to monitor the elections <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invited delegations from the European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and a number of Latin and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries, and said other delegations would not be welcome. The official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation is to arrive Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, thereby avoiding <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s requirement for entrance visas. At another news conference, government candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> denied that fraud was planned. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should say how this fraud will take place before the eyes of the world. The observers will recognize our triumph,'' <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> said. `` We do not seek a confrontation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We think the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has fallen for disinformation, disinformation lead by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy which has played an unfortunate role.'' <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should continue in command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, but that this was up to the institution of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> itself. `` Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has never violated the law and has always acted within the institutional framework of his command,'' said <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. As armed forces chief, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has predicted the elections will be blatantly fraudulent and accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of rigging the balloting for Duque. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the voting process is riddled with irregularities. The opposition says an abnormal increase in the number of registered voters indicates double registration and shows that bogus voting cards are being distributed to pro-government voters. A spokesman for <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinz </PERSON>, said Radio Suave, owned by opposition legislative candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabrega </PERSON> was closed Friday, but said he did not know why. `` These days we do n't ask those things here,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition press has been closed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for 15 months, but the opposition has had access to some radio stations. <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, hand-picked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has contended that the opposition is in league with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to cancel or delay the delivery of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. The Duque campaign has made heavy use of news reports that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government authorized $ 10 million for the opposition campaign to bolster its claim that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to manage <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Opposition leaders deny seeking or accepting any foreign contributions. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure since two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug trafficking charges in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges, calling them a ploy to get rid of him in favor of someone more willing to follow <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s wishes. While <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is not a candidate, his rule is considered very much an issue in the campaign. In February 1988, President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> following the drug indictments. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has held de facto power since he became Defense Forces chief in 1983, orchestrated <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s removal. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was replaced by Education Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize, as acting president.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be allowed to screen federal judicial nominees unless it stops considering a candidate's political and ideological beliefs, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he intended to hold the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> to an agreement he says it made to revert to old language in its guidelines that does n't specifically provide for any consideration of such views. One of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s top aides, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, said that unless the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> accepts the agreement, `` I do n't think they will be involved'' in screening judicial candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> will be able to resume its participation in screening professional qualifications of prospective nominees as soon as it accepts the agreement as described by the attorney general, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The dispute broke out Tuesday when <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> leaders disavowed a statement <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> made to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that they had agreed to stop considering political and ideological philosophy. And that position was reiterated Friday night by <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, who said in a statement the bar group `` does not examine and make value judgments about candidates' political or ideological views.'' `` Problems of wording and problems of perception are curable,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` We look forward to working out mutually acceptable language with the attorney general.'' `` They got our language, go back to what it was in 1979,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in reply. `` That's what they agreed to and we expect them to honor it.'' Concern among conservatives over the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> guideline surfaced after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 1987 vote against confirming <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday he shared the concern. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is preparing to fill some 50 vacancies on federal district and appellate courts. Traditionally, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> has confidentially canvassed a candidates' peers to assess professional abilities at the request of the administration. It advises the president of its findings and delivers a rating to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> during the confirmation process. The issue is particularly sensitive because <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s choice to be his deputy attorney general, has been criticized by conservatives for the way he conducted the screening process when he chaired the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel in the early 1980s. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, has charged that <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> improperly told a liberal activist group the names of judicial nominees under review. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> was guilty of `` leaking information which was provided to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> in confidence to groups that use that information to mount campaigns against persons who are not yet nominated.'' At Tuesday's hearing, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> credited <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> with obtaining the agreement from the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the attorney general `` stated what he believed was an agreement and prior to that and subsequent to that, that's our understanding.'' During his congressional testimony, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said `` we are pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> standing committee has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only contentious but in my view improper for their consideration _ that is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective nominees.'' But <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the standing committee, denied that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> had ever considered political views except to assess whether they affected a person's professional qualifications. In his statement Friday night, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said `` If a candidate's personal philosophy, however, incorporates racially prejudiced views, for example, we woud not agree that the candidate has the open-mindedness and freedom from bias requisite for a position on the bench. `` Our practice in this regard has remained unchanged,'' he said. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> acknowledged only that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> had `` expressed a willingness'' to delete a sentence from the latest version of the `` backgrounder'' it publishes to describe the screening process. The sentence that has raised the ire of conservatives reads: `` Political or ideological philosophy are not considered, except to the extent they may bear upon the other factors.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> released copies of letters exchanged between <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> last month that he said had formed the basis of the agreement. The agreement was sealed in a telephone call from <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> to the attorney general's executive assistant, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. In an April 21 letter to the attorney general, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> wrote that the sentence `` has generated confusion'' and charges that the panel considers political or ideological beliefs. `` This committee does not believe that that is the case,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> added. `` Nevertheless, to make that as clear as possible, we certainly are prepared to accept your suggestion of abandoning the language.'' `` In sum,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> concluded, `` be assured that, to track the earlier language, this committee does not investigate a prospective nominee's political or ideological philosophy, except to the extent that extreme views on such matters might bear upon judicial temperament or integrity.'' In an April 27 reply, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said `` I am concerned about the final sentence of your letter.'' The attorney general wrote that in his meetings with <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, `` I thought I had expressed clearly my view that the <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> should in fact revert to its policy statement in effect prior to 1980, which excluded any consideration of a prospective nominee's political or ideological philosophy.'' `` I would hope we are in agreement on this point,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Foes Discuss How to Turn Tide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With about 2,200 people on death row and polls showing support for the death penalty at an all-time high, several hundred opponents are meeting here this weekend to try to turn the political tide. `` One reason for the change in public attitudes is irresponsible leadership by our politicians,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> defense attorney and organizer of the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Abolish the Death Penalty. The regional conference begins Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, the coalition plans to honor Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his refusal to abandon his longtime opposition to the death penalty for political gain, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign last year was deeply wounded by charges that he was soft on crime. A Gallup poll in December, one month after the election, found that 79 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public favored the death penalty for murderers. That was 9 percent more than in 1986 and the highest percentage since pollsters began asking the question in 1936, a Gallup spokeswoman said. The poll also showed a dramatic shift since 1966, when 47 percent of those polled by <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> opposed the death penalty and only 42 percent supported it. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> and other abolitionists said the 1988 presidential campaign, which made murderer <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> a household name, has left politicians across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> afraid to buck public opinion. `` It's an expedient political tactic to take a very repressive view on the death penalty, and then attack one's opponent by associating him with heinous criminals,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` That's the <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> tactic.'' Although the tactic was used very effectively by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> predicted it will soon lose its potency. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> fled from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> during a prison furlough in 1987 and later brutally attacked a couple in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where he is now serving a lengthy prison sentence. The case was the subject of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign ads attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and supporting the death penalty. The governor will receive the <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrmann </PERSON> Award, named after one of the lawyers who defended <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vanzetti </PERSON> and his wife, who fought against their execution. <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bartolomeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanzetti </PERSON>, both anarchists, were put to death in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1927 for the murder of a paymaster and his guard during a robbery. Four people have been executed in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> so far this year, including serial killer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Karima </PERSON> <PERSON> Wicks </PERSON>, research director with the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She said abolitionists plan to stress the racist nature of the death penalty, which studies have shown is disproportionately applied to blacks, Hispanics, the poor and the indigent. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a bid to overturn the death penalty on those grounds.

Schoolchildren celebrated in the plaza at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where a fiesta will bring at least 25,000 people a day through the weekend. `` There's lots of margaritas to be had,'' said bartender <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Madruga </PERSON>, mixing the icy tequila concoctions at the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where the Battle of <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION> will be re-enacted over the weekend. Similar festivities got under way elsewhere in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and across the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, even on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` People are getting used to the idea. We run some flyers so that everybody remembers May 5th,'' said banquet manager <PERSON> Rosalinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrieta </PERSON> at an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Torito </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, that planned `` pinata madness.'' Ms. <PERSON> Arrieta </PERSON>, judge of a contest to see how many fiery jalapeno peppers customers could consume, said guessing how many margaritas would be served during <PERSON> Cinco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> `` would be very hard.'' Cinco de Mayo marks the stand of an outnumbered Mexican force against a superior French army at <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION> in 1862. Although the French emperor <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> eventually withdrew his invading army from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for reasons other than the <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION> setback, it is a proud date in Mexican history. `` It's a celebration of the underdog,'' said actress <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, who believes that non-Mexican Americans have adopted Cinco de Mayo because they can identify with that spirit through American history. Miss <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> is a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Bilingual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, which named actors <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> to receive its `` El Angel'' awards for contributions to Hispanic arts at a dinner Friday night. `` I think that we are beginning to take our place in society here,'' said Miss <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> before the annual banquet, `` Ole Salsa,'' at the Biltmore Hotel. `` I feel that we have and will have a tremendous impact on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture in the years to come.'' But <PERSON> Cinco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> was n't just fun and food. The nation also sought to deal with obligations to the burgeoning Hispanic population. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> _ a considerably shortened version of the name originally bestowed in 1769 _ county Supervisor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> repeated his call for adding two seats to the Board of Supervisors to boost ethnic representation. All five seats are now held by <PERSON> Anglos </PERSON>. `` Hispanics comprise approximately 35 percent of the population in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but there is only a handful of Hispanic elected officials to represent their interests. This is unfair and unjust, and the situation must change,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials observed <PERSON> Cinco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> with festivities at a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> legalization office to urge temporary residents to file immediately for permanent status under the amnesty law enacted two years ago. About 250,000 temporary residents have signed up for permanent residency in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Region </LOCATION> _ consisting of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> _ out of 1.8 million eligible applicants, he said.

 A high school student and his married date have been getting invitations to dance at proms across the country since they were denied permission to attend his hometown prom. <PERSON> Jayme </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessels </PERSON>, 17, wanted to take <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>, 35, to the <ORGANIZATION> Alburnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> prom last Saturday but the school board denied permission, saying it was inappropriate for a student to bring a married date to a school event. A judge upheld the school, saying the school board's decision was n't out of bounds, and the couple stayed home. But word of their case spread around the country and invitations to attend other proms are streaming in. `` I think they've had a dozen invitations from high school proms across the country,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON>'s husband of 19 years, <PERSON> Don </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jayme </PERSON> has said he and Mrs. <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> have been friends about two years and that he often joins her family, including <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Washburn </PERSON> and four children, on social outings. `` She treats me as a friend and I treat her as a mother,'' he said. <PERSON> Wessels </PERSON>' parents are divorced.

<TEXT>
 The new government of President Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> announced Friday the retirement of 34 army generals, including several close friends of ousted strongman Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. In announcing the army retirements, the government said <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> will be allowed to keep the honorary rank of general of division. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for 34 years as president and commander-in-chief of the army until ousted by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> in a Feb. 3 coup. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s eldest son <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel who accompanied his father into exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> after the coup, was ordered cashiered for `` desertion,'' the government said. The retirement list, announced in a communique, included the names of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> collaborators Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretes </PERSON> <PERSON> Davalos </PERSON>, former army chief of staff; Gen. <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, former defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Guanes </PERSON>, former chief of military intelligence; and Gen. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Britez </PERSON>, former chief of police.

Voters also chose a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> that will finish the 1988-1993 terms left vacant by the coup. One of the new president's first acts Tuesday was to order a 70 percent pay increase for all military personel and a 30 percent boost for all public employees. Under the new pay scale, a general of division, the highest ranking officer, will earn the equivalent of $ 990 a month. A sergeant first class will earn the equivalent of $ 167 monthly.

The federal attorney general's office discounted arson and said the blaze broke out in the electrical system. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> identified the victim as <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soriano </PERSON>, 33, who suffocated. Another guard, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, was treated for smoke inhalation at nearby <LOCATION> Balbuena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Doctors said his condition is not serious. Nine hours after the fire broke out, plumes of dark smoke rose from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lazaro </LOCATION> palace. Fire officials said only embers remained, and the fire was under control. Police superintendent <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> said a short-circuit apparently started the fire in the main chamber, where national deputies gather and where joint congressional sessions are held. The fire destroyed the chamber, officials said. The national <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> meets in another part of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The chief of the nearby <PERSON> Balbuena </PERSON> fire station faulted the 8-year-old smoke detection system. `` If those in charge of security had known right away there was smoke in the building, they could have called the station, which is one minute's drive away,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. `` The flames would not have caused destruction of such magnitude.'' The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> quoted Fire Chief <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> as saying the fire damaged at least 40 percent of the palace. At least 160 firefighters worked for more than an hour to bring it under control. <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON> said the chamber floor, which can seat more than 500 legislators, was a shambles. An ornate sculpted mural, about 60 feet long and 30 feet wide with 50 tons of bronze relief, was destroyed, he said. Scorch marks marred the entrance to the building, which was completed in 1981.

 A man with a pistol fatally shot a woman Friday across the street from a school kindergarten pupils outside for recess, then wounded two police officers before he was captured. Police said the suspect, identified as <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 25, had been a high school classmate of the victim and had harassed her in the past, but the motive was unclear. None of the children was injured. The shootings began shortly after noon in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, when the suspect crashed his car head-on into a car driven by the victim, according to police radio reports. A witness, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckner </PERSON>, said he heard the crash and looked out the window of the plumbing shop where he works and saw the woman's car spinning down the road. `` I saw a man carrying a handgun, walking fast toward the car,'' <PERSON> Beckner </PERSON> said. `` He put the gun inside the driver's window and shot three times.'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesenbring </PERSON>, 25, of nearby <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, suffered three gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead a short time later at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellak </PERSON>. A second young woman in the car escaped injury. `` She said to us that her friend, the driver, told her, ` Oh, my God, he's got a gun!','' <PERSON> Beckner </PERSON> said. `` So she rolled out of the car and underneath.'' The man fled, stole a pickup truck and headed toward a wooded area along the <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Police followed and a shootout ensued, in which one officer was hit in the shoulder and the other in the abdomen. Officer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackley </PERSON> of the police department in nearby <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>'s with a gunshot wound to the pelvic area, and Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Osenga </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Kankakee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was in fair condition with a shoulder wound, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Yohnka </PERSON>. Eastman, also of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, was taken into custody and charged with murder. Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bourbonnais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the suspect has had previous run-ins with authorities and last month kicked and dented a car Miss Mesenbring was driving.

Ms. <PERSON> Gall </PERSON> `` told them to take action, cover their head and fall to the ground, and then to move out,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 An Italian film company said Friday it has signed an $ 80 million deal with a Soviet production company to produce three films, including one on the Mongol conqueror <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON>, pesident of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said a two-part, four-hour epic entitled `` Genghis Khan'' would be the first film produced in cooperation with the Soviet Cinema of Perestroika. It will be directed by <PERSON> Tolomush </PERSON> <PERSON> Okeyev </PERSON>, whose 1975 film `` The Fierce Wolf'' received an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. The producers said the title role in the $ 20 million film would go to an American actor and that negotiations were underway with an independent <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> company to provide special effects. The Italian firm will provide most of the financing for the three films, <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> added. Filming of `` <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>'' will begin in January in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and is expected to last about a year. A six-hour television version of the film will be released later for worldwide distribution. <PERSON> Okeyev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, whose name has become synonymous with ruthless barbarism during the 12th and 13th centuries, had always been considered a `` negative figure'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But he said that under perestroika, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring of Soviet society, Soviet officials have allowed the lives of other historical figures to be reconsidered without past prejudice. `` We want to tell the truth of how it really was,'' said <PERSON> Okeyev </PERSON>. `` It's impossible for a man on a horse to conquer as much territory as he did without a brain.'' The second film, `` The Silent Don'' is based on the epic novel by Nobel laureate <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sholokov </PERSON>. It deals with the effects of World War I and the Russian Revolution on the lives of the Don Cossacks. The two-part film will be directed by <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondarciuk </PERSON>, who won a 1968 foreign film Oscar for `` War and Peace,'' and later directed `` <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>'' and `` Ten Days That Shook the World,'' based on the life of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> studios would take part in the project, with will feature an international cast. The third film, `` <LOCATION> Tamerlane </LOCATION>,'' will be directed by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamraev </PERSON> and is based on the life of the 14th century Mongol conqueror who claimed to be a descendant of <PERSON> Genghis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to work for peace among themselves, said a colleague who was allowed to visit the imprisoned black leader for five hours Friday. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, terminally ill with a neurological disease, was accompanied by his lawyer and a friend to see <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> at the <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. He would not reveal who initiated the meeting or give details, but he said part of the conversation was about violence in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister said Friday the government wants to bring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black majority into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch, but on condition that the white minority can not be overruled. Security for the 5 million whites can be ensured `` only in an environment of progress, safety and justice for all the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, constitutional development minister, said in a speech to Parliament. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> gave him a message saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> should `` try and strive for peace among themselves and to keep up their determination to bring about a new <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' He and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, both 70, have been members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since the 1940s. Until <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>'s release in November, both were serving life sentences on convictions stemming from their involvement with the outlawed guerrilla movement. Friday's meeting was their first since 1982, when <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was moved from <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> prison to the <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> penitentiary. <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> told journalists he had not expected to see <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> again because `` we were doing life. We only had hope that we would see each other in a free country.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> apparently does not entertain hopes of beeing released soon, <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> said, but `` he seemed in good health. From what we had heard he was very much improved.'' He said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> wore civilian clothes and no guards observed their meeting. The Heunis speech in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was a summary of proposals he and other government officials have mentioned in recent months. He said details of a new constitutional system must be negotiated and offered few specifics of the new role envisioned for blacks. No black leaders have accepted the government's invitation to constitutional negotiations. Militant blacks have rejected plans put forth by <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, but some moderates have indicated they would negotiate if the government freed <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, among others, and lifted bans on black opposition groups. Speculation that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be freed after the Sept. 6 general elections increased with the <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON> visit. Previous efforts to win his release have been blocked by the nationalist leader's refusal to renounce violence in the campaign for majority rule

<TEXT>
 The exiled 73-year-old son of Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> on Friday announced his ascension to the imperial throne of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, where a Marxist government rules. Wearing a blue Western-style suit and seated on a chair in his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment, <PERSON> Ahma </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> I and members of his government-in-exile indicated they believe the regime now governing their homeland will soon fall. `` There are many indications to show that the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> people are desperate for a new system of government, a new democratic organization,'' said <PERSON> Seife </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zewde </PERSON>, son-in-law of <PERSON> Ahma </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> and privy councilor to the throne. He said 3 million Ethiopians are in exile, the army has suffered many defections, and the government is spending nearly 80 percent of its budget on the military. The underdeveloped east African nation struggles with civil war and periodic famine. <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> was deposed in 1974 by a military coup that brought Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> to power. The emperor died in captivity in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1975. Members of the government-in-exile said <PERSON> Ahma </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> would normally have assumed the throne a year later. However, they said he did not do so because of the chaos caused by the military takeover. <PERSON> Ahma </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON> secretly accepted the throne on April 6, 1988, at the request of two councils of state kings and elected officials, said <PERSON> Zewde </PERSON>, who acted as interpreter. The public announcement was delayed over worries about the safety of the government-in-exile, he said. It was to be made two weeks ago, but no reporters came because of a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway strike. Most foreign countries do not recognize the government-in-exile.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, in charge of cleaning up the nation's largest oil spill, on Friday told <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to put more crews to work and `` do whatever it takes'' to clean <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s fouled beaches. `` What I said to <LOCATION> Exxon </LOCATION> this morning is that they are going to have to produce a significantly greater effort,'' the admiral said. `` That means an increase in the work unit productivity'' in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s revised proposal for cleanup operations this summer. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> must approve <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s clean-up plan before it goes into effect, but said he has not yet made a decision. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> criticized the plan as poorly drafted and lacking in specifics. The state also has criticized it and urged extensive changes. But on Friday, he called the plan `` workable ... but it needs expansion.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> was chosen by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to supervise the cleanup of the March 24 spill, when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> slammed into a reef and poured more than 10 million gallons of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` Some of the cleanup is difficult to the point that one wonders if restoration will ever be possible,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` Restoration will probably be done by the Lord in the next few years. I do n't think restoration is going to be done by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in the next few months on all of the beaches. It's not possible.'' A state official said that half of the oil in Alaskan waters has dissipated, and much of what's left has been churned into a taffylike goo and tossed up on beaches. `` Exactly how that's going to be dealt with I do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, an environmentalist with the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of it is tar balls. The cleanup procedures are going to have to be tailored.'' After a wind - and rain-swept six-hour tour of the area late Thursday, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he believes `` Exxon's going to have to do more than they think they're going to have to do <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, returning from a 12-day Pacific tour, met with a group of <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON> residents before heading to the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juneau </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship used as a base of operations for part of the spill cleanup, and to <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, and joined by <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> abandoned a wooden platform built specially for his visit, and tried his hand at hosing some of the oil off a rocky beach. `` It's going to be an enormous effort,'' he said after looking at the blackened island, an important resting and birthing area for seals. The tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> slammed into a reef in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> on March 24, causing the nation's largest oil spill and sullying hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coastline. Under <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, 364 miles of coastline will be cleansed by Sept. 15, although nearly 200 of those miles may be left untouched _ to be scoured by wind and wave action. The plan also seeks to dispose of waste by burying it, burning it or discharging it through a wastewater treatment plant in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The company has asked for permission to bypass some environmental laws in order to dispose of the wastes. In other developments Friday: _ The lawyer for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> said the fired tanker captain was not drunk when he left the vessel in command of his third mate prior to the shipwreck <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> left the bridge to do paperwork in his cabin below, which was part of his normal routine, attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> told reporters after a brief court proceeding at <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chalos </PERSON> asserted the accident could have been prevented had the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> been monitoring the vessel, as was its responsibility. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, surrendered to Alaskan authorities this week on three misdemeanor charges of operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. His attorneys were in court to formally request that the fugitive from justice warrant issued last month be canceled. Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> granted the request. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, which pipes oil to tankers from the trans-Alaska pipeline, said it will require that tankers leaving <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> be escorted by special, 200-foot-long spill-recovery boats `` Under the new plan, every tanker leaving Port Valdez will be escorted by a tug and a large emergency response vessel loaded with oil containment and recovery equipment,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, president of the company.

 The Central Park jogger brutalized by a pack of roving teen-agers conquered a fever Friday and continued to mend slowly, doctors said. Although the cause of her 106-degree fever on Thursday was not determined, `` we're gratified, as of today, that none of the potential sources of this fever has turned out to be exceedingly dangerous,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, director of the surgical intensive care unit. The patient's temperature dropped from 100.1 to 99.8 on Friday afternoon. A CAT scan showed no abscess or meningitis. But some medications were changed to counter the `` distant possibility'' that they had caused the fever, said <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>. The 28-year-old woman was resting comfortably and showed some neurological progress, although she tired easily, had a short attention span and was disoriented, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said in a statement. The Wall Street investment banker, who was in a coma for two weeks after she was beaten and raped on April 19, regained consciousness Tuesday, speaking in a hoarse whisper to relatives and staff members. Her condition has remained critical despite her progress. Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault in her case. On Friday, those six youths and two others were indicted on charges of assaulting a male jogger during the crime spree that culminated in the attack on the woman. The alleged attackers were among more than 30 youths who went to the park for a night of `` wilding'' _ random attacks on anyone they encountered while roaming the area, police said.

 A winery worker accused of killing his wife, two of their daughters and four other people in a bloody rampage pleaded innocent Friday to charges that could send him to the gas chamber. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 28, looked glum and unkempt as he entered the innocent pleas to seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder in connection with an April 14 crime spree through the wine country north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. And an expression of sympathy for a victim of that spree emerged from an unlikely place, with hundreds of prisoners at the <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail collecting $ 900 during two `` days of peace'' for <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s 3-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, who survived a cut throat allegedly inflicted by her father. `` I've had enough of violence, and what was done to her was pure evil,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Menjou </PERSON>, 42, serving time at the jail on a forgery conviction. `` I wanted her to know that men do n't have to be mean and cruel, but to know that they can be loving, kind and caring,'' said <PERSON> Menjou </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> in an isolation cell at the jail charged with killing <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>'s mother and two sisters, his mother-in-law and her two young daughters, and a winery worker he told detectives he believed was having an affair with his wife. He also is charged with the attempted murder of <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, whose throat was cut, and trying to shoot to death two other people. In court Friday, about 20 sheriff's deputies stood guard inside and outside the courtroom, searching bags and passing metal detectors over spectators as they came in. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> listened to the proceedings through a court-provided <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> interpreter but answered the judge in English, saying `` Yes, your honor,'' in a barely audible voice. In addition to pleading innocent to all the charges, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> denied an allegation of multiple murder, a special circumstance that if proved could result in a sentence of death or life in prison without possibility of parole. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Knoel </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> set a date of Sept. 11 for a preliminary hearing and refused to lift a gag order he imposed earlier in the case. The fund raising for <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> was the idea of an inmate counseling group run by the Rev. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutleben </PERSON>, the jail's unofficial chaplain He had noted that inmates often have an unwritten code calling for the maiming or murder of pedophiles and child murderers. `` In trying to help inmates deal with some of the really heavy hatred they've directed at <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON>, we posed the question, thinking about Carmina: What would be most helpful, to assure her you as inmates would kill her daddy, or something else,'' said <PERSON> Gutleben </PERSON>. `` We asked them instead to give the gift that killers would not give _ the gift of non-violence,'' he added. <PERSON> Gutleben </PERSON> said he was shocked by the inmates' outpouring of concern for the child. Numerous prisoners who have only $ 1.50 in their jail accounts gave $ 1 to the fund, and several gave the full amount. Those who donated gave an average of half their savings, he estimated. `` These guys dug down to every cent they literally had in their pockets. They are going to go without cigarettes and other basic necessities because they want to reach out of their anger and despair and direct something positive to <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Gutleben </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gutleben </PERSON>, who runs Sebastopol-based Covenant Connection, a non-denominational ministry to inmates and ex-convicts, said 90 percent of the jail's 690 prisoners participated in the collection drive and the two-day pledge of non-violence. Sheriff's deputies have been concerned about the safety of 28-year-old <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> since he was captured in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> April 19. He was brought to the county jail the next night, where a furious crowd of 200 people shouted `` Kill him.'' Weather stripping was added to his cell door to prevent inmates from slipping anything harmful inside. Authorities also put up a large metal plate to keep inmates from looking into <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s cell through a window. Whenever he is moved from this third-floor cell _ for showers, exercise or court appointments _ all of the 50 to 60 inmates on the floor are confined to their cells. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> also is accompanied by three guards. Twenty-four hour supervision, which also serves as a suicide watch, is provided by an officer watching <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> through a window in the wall of his cell. <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON> has been showered by hundreds of gifts at <LOCATION> Petaluma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and donations have poured into a trust fund set up for her. <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>'s grandfather, who has applied for custody, has not disclosed how much has been raised.

 A ban on campaigning went into effect here Friday, two days before presidential and congressional elections in which former military dictator <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> is expected to emerge as president. Ten parties are competing in the elections. Besides the presidency, all 27 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and all 130 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> are at stake. About two dozen foreign observers are on hand, most of them from Latin American countries and organizations. Foreign diplomats said, however, that they did not expect any widespread fraud. Electoral officials distributed ballot boxes, freshly painted a pale green, and numbered, multicolored ballots on Friday to polling places in school gymnasiums and other public buildings. `` Everything is ready for Sunday,'' <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` Voting material will be distributed to all polling places today and tomorrow.'' Under Bolivian law, all campaigning must halt two full days before balloting. Police were out in force late Thursday night, controlling the streets as party activists staged last-minute rallies and marches. No heavy security presence was evident on Friday, but officers guarded polling places. The independent <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> asked its ranks to `` monitor the voting process and denounce any attempts at fraud.'' It said its effort was aimed mainly `` at marginal city neighborhoods and rural areas.'' The presidential front-runner in most polls was <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON>, 62, a retired army general and standard-bearer of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>. The two other major candidates are industrialist <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, 58, of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, 50, a former vice president, of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> of the Revolutionary Left. None is expected to win more than 50 percent of the total vote. In such a case, <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> is given authority to choose the president from among the top three finishers when it convenes Aug. 4. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> finished first in the last presidential election in 1985, with 28.6 percent of the vote, but congress picked runner-up <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, with 26.4 percent, to be president. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>, now 81, is retiring from politics. <PERSON> Banzer </PERSON> seized power in a 1971 coup that toppled a leftist military dictatorship and ruled until 1978, when popular pressure forced him to call elections.

 Airborne Angolan army units destroyed an important rebel base in northern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, killing 19 insurgents and capturing about 200, a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news report said Friday. The report comes during a suspension in offensive action by the U.S.-backed rebels. The National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, has said it will attack government forces only if provoked. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, said 200 government soldiers attacked the rebel base at <LOCATION> Pipanema </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Malange </LOCATION> province, about 125 miles from the <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. It did not say when the attack occurred. Government forces flew there in ten Soviet-built helicopters that showered the rebels with heavy fire before the army units landed, said the report. The Pipanema base was headquarters for 1,000 guerrillas, <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> said. Citing Angolan army sources, the report said 19 rebels died and about 200 were captured in the attack. In <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he knew nothing of the attack.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, the first member of the Soviet National Team to defect to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, arrived Friday night in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, where he hopes to continue his hockey career with the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION>. Sabres General Manager <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, after the budding Soviet star decided to defect following the World Hockey Championships, which ended earlier this week. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, regarded as one of the Soviets' future stars, was supposed to appear at a news conference called by the <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said the 20-year-old winger was tired from the trip and interviews with immigration officials. `` His day has been so tiring, we did n't want to put him through another exhausting round of exposure,'' said <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, who declined to say where <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> was staying. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> also denied an accusation by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION> were guilty of `` piracy'' in bringing <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION> were totally open and above-board'' in dealing with <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, he said. The Sabres began talks with <ORGANIZATION> Mogilny </ORGANIZATION> `` at the specific request of the player,'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. `` It was a voluntary departure.'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> would not say whether <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> had signed a contract and also declined comment on published reports that indicated a romantic relationship with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman may have been involved in the defection. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> admitted there are potential problems with international ice hockey officials, the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> and American immigration officials that could keep <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> from playing for <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. `` I would n't say they -LRB- his chances of playing with <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> -RRB- are pretty good or pretty bad,'' he said `` There are hurdles that have to be resolved.'' Soviet coach <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> said the defection cast a shadow over attempts by other Soviet players to sign with <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> teams. Soviet coach <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> said he was disgusted by the defection and said it cast a shadow over attempts by other Soviet hockey players to sign with <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> teams. <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Koloskov </PERSON>, head of the soccer and hockey department of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview published Friday in the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> he expected no serious repercussions in Soviet-NHL relations. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> was accompanied on the flight from <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION>' director of amateur development. Upon his arrival, <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, who was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> team, was interviewed at the airport by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` They do that with all defectors,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Middlemiss </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> first contacted the Sabres by phone on Tuesday, then met with <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> the following day. `` I had no idea he wanted to come on Tuesday. It happened very fortuitively,'' he said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Sabres </ORGANIZATION> did not contact the <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> before meeting with <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said many details, including presumbly <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>'s status as a Soviet defector, had to be worked out, but he said there was plenty of time, since the start of the next <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> season is five months away. `` We hope he'll be able to play next year,'' he said <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> refused to discuss any details about a contract or <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>'s status with immigration or whether he had been granted asylum. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>, who helped the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to its 21st world hockey title last week, was granted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa on Thursday. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> was in his third year with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> team and played 11 international matches with the Soviet national team before this season. He was voted the world's best junior player by <ORGANIZATION> NHL </ORGANIZATION> scouts in a poll organized by The Hockey News. But the right wing had his troubles with Soviet hockey authorities. He was suspended for 10 days before the world championships after a fight in a Soviet league game. A Swedish newspaper reported last week that <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON> had a month's salary withdrawn and lost his `` Master of Sports'' order. He was also quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying he was not interested in a military career. `` I want to do something else with my life,'' he was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Mogilny </PERSON>'s role as a junior lieutenant in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> added a further diplomatic complication. Soviet authorities could view the incident as desertion.

 An explosion caused by confiscated fireworks shattered a downtown fire station Friday and injured at least 39 people, officials said. `` It was so sudden.

<HEAD>`Approaching Zanzibar,' A Play by Tina Howe, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s `` Approaching <LOCATION> Zanzibar </LOCATION>,'' which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Second Stage, is a life-affirming meditation on death. If that sounds a bit contradictory, so is Miss <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s sad, funny and beautifully written new play. In it, the playwright chronicles the 2,000-mile journey by a suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> family to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> bedside of a dying aunt. But their trip is not the shortest distance between two points. The play tells the story of their automobile trip, but it also involves circuitous flights of fancy that might make more literal-minded members of the audience scratch their heads. `` Approaching Zanzibar'' represents a change for Miss <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> from her more naturalistic, straightforward dramas such as `` Painting Churches'' and `` Coastal Disturbances.'' Like `` Painting Churches,'' the play celebrates family, and not just the husband, wife, son and daughter who make the journey, but everyone they meet along the way including a man and his newborn son, a grandmother and her deaf grandson and the wife's brother and his pregnant wife. They all seem to be related in a mystical, other-worldly way. The husband -LRB- Harris Yulin -RRB- is a composer stymied by creative block. His wife -LRB- <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> -RRB- faces the end of her child-bearing years. Between hot flashes, she hears the cries of a lost baby, perhaps a child she now will never have. Their son is a classical guitar prodigy, and the boy's younger sister is a precocious 9-year-old who becomes the family's link to the old aunt. Miss <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> has an odd, quirky style that constantly surprises, but she also has an ear for the mundane conversation of family life. She perfectly captures the squabbling between husband and wife, brother and sister and parents and children. In one hilarious, topsy-turvy scene, the playwright has the children playing their parents while the parents are the children. The actors handle their role reversals with astonishing ease. The author also brings to life the special relationships between these people. There's a magical moment at the end of Act 1 when brother and sister, left alone at a campsite, are afraid. But gradually their sense of wonder takes over as the boy plays his guitar, the girl waves a brightly colored circus light and they both gaze at the stars. The same delight in life occurs near the end of the play when the young girl and her dying aunt, a painter who resembles <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> O'Keeffe </ORGANIZATION>, reach an understanding. They trade information on their favorite color, animal and lucky number. The old woman dreamily recalls a romantic trip she made from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zanzibar </LOCATION>. It's these memories of past good times that pervade the play, but they are not maudlin. Miss <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> is not afraid to laugh in the face of death, and her characters have a good time as they make their way across the country to pay tribute to the dying woman. Miss <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yulin </PERSON> capture the anxiety of middle age as one parent discovers his career at a dead end and the other finds her job becoming obsolete. Director <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> coaxes unmannered performances from the two children, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> as the son and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Goethals </PERSON> as the daughter. They are exasperating, lovable, mean, perceptive, funny and just about perfect in their portrayals. Most of the other acting is adequate, although <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> seems too young and healthy to play the grievously ill, 81-year-old aunt. Miss <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON> has given the play an inventive production, nine scenes that take place in wildly divergent settings. They include a sailboat racing across an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> lake and a mountain stream in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> where father and son fish. Set designer <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON> has no trouble conjuring up both on the theater's tiny stage. Near the end of the play, the wife ruminates about life and pretty much sums up what the playwright is trying to say. `` You dance through childhood, race through the teen-age years, fall in love a few million times, bear some delicious bald babies and then, whhhstt, it's all over,'' she opines. `` Approaching Zanzibar'' makes that journey an exhilarating and at times poignant ride.

<TEXT>
 The rich, infectious singing style of <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> may have an exotic name _ ingom ` esbusku, but the South African harmonies are familiar to American music The four women who make up <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> -LRB- Zulu for happiness -RRB- are accompanied by traditional drums, and the band Bayeza -LRB- they are coming -RRB- which re-creates the bouncy, guitar-driven sound of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s black townships. The result, punctuated by distinctly African ululations and the `` click sounds'' of the Zulu language, hints of the `` call-and-response'' style of American gospel, the emotion of blues and the energy of jazz improvisation. The group once shared the bill with a gospel quartet led by a staid 78-year-old minister who at first looked askance at <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION>'s brightly colored African costumes, recalled <PERSON> Thuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON>, the group's lead singer `` After we sang, the reverend came and said, ` Wow, was that gospel? I could n't tell because of the language.' But he heard the spirit,'' she said. `` The music broke the ice, we started relating to each other.'' Ingom ` esbusku -LRB- night music -RRB- is gaining a new, international audience thanks in part to Grammy-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African group that recorded the `` Graceland'' LP with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> At a recent concert in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, the singers wore black dresses with splashes of brightly patterned cloth tied around their waists and hair, and white canvas shoes that flashed like semaphore as they moved in quick, high steps. `` South African dancing is more like the sound of the drum,'' said <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON>. `` The footwork is just complementing the drums.'' <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON>, whose quiet speaking voice contrasts with her soaring, emotional singing, is the only <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> member born in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Amma </PERSON> <PERSON> Oloriwaa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ghanneiyya </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> were born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` South Africans will come backstage to talk to the performers. They ask, ` Which part of home are you from?' And the people say, ` I'm from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>,''' said Welcome Msomi, <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON>'s husband and <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION>'s producer. `` There are some of us who only came in 1979, and there are others who have been here for hundreds of years. But still, we are Africans,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION>, who occasionally adds a bass line to <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> and writes some of its songs. `` Even though we ca n't trace our roots, maybe by singing we can hear where we came from,'' <PERSON> Oloriwaa </PERSON> said. `` If you have a deep, guttural gospel sound, then maybe your people came from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. If it's high, maybe it's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION>'s repertoire includes traditional African songs as well as original pieces that often call for social and political change in racially torn <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The group recently completed several concerts on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> _ including performances at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Town Hall and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s Symphony Hall _ with a <LOCATION> Gambian </LOCATION> balladeer, a gospel choir and Puerto Rican plena and bomba band in a show called the African Heritage Tour <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> also performed at 25 elementary and high schools in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area last year, and on college campuses in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The group grew from the theater that <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> founded in 1979 in the largely black Bedford-Stuyvesant section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> started the original IZulu Theater in 1965 in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> brought IZulu to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to stage `` Umbatah,'' which <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> describes as a Zulu version of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s `` Macbeth.'' `` Umbatah'' later played at the <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Festival </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where it was seen by producers who offered to stage it in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` When the show closed -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB-, I made up my mind that I was going to start up a branch of the theater in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> said. `` I love the challenge.'' Msmoi and <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON> began with Zulu dance and language classes, nurturing an interest in <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> culture among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blacks that allowed the South African couple to build a company. The plays they produced often included song and dance. `` As we were growing, people began demanding to hear more of the music,'' <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Then, when <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> came out with ` Graceland,' people started to discover South African music. People started to demand South African music, then <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION> started to develop.'' `` Graceland'' was named album of the year in 1986, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo went on to capture its own Grammy for best traditional folk album, `` <PERSON> Shaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON>,'' a year later. <PERSON> Dumakude </PERSON> had at first planned to find other South Africans for <LOCATION> Thokoza </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, she had been taught that blacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were not African, and she had found that many black Americans were unaware of, or unwilling to acknowledge, their ties to her home. `` It has always been a plan to divide us,'' she said. `` I was looking for someone who would say, ` I am an African-American.'' <ORGANIZATION> Msomi </ORGANIZATION> believes blacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been influenced by negative media images of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Through the music, we can also educate other people. We are the ones to bring out the truth.''

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is n't a Texan anymore, but some traits remain _ the boots, the hat, the tendency to do everything in a big way. The oilman began footing college bills for individual students some time back. A year ago, he told a couple hundred underachieving seventh - and eighth-graders he'd see to it they could go to college if they kept up their grades Now he wants everybody in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> who makes the grades to be able to go. `` We have tax-supported colleges in this state that everyone pays for, but they are just for those families who can afford tuition, room and board,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` Nothing is as bizarre in this day and time as to turn a kid who is qualified for college away just because he does n't have a few thousand dollars to pay for it.'' A self-made millionaire who left home at 16 and worked his way through <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> believes the opportunity to go to college is the key to solving a lot of the nation's problems `` It would cut the number of people in prison, the number on welfare, the number selling and using drugs. People would see a chance at a future and they would n't waste it. You ca n't expect kids to do well in school if they feel they have nowhere to go,'' he said. `` I used to believe ours is an equal opportunity society and that we are the only truly classless society in the world. Now I know that is n't true. We have two classes in this country _ those with a chance and those without.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a Horatio Alger Award recipient, frequently gave motivational speeches about his rise from poverty. He was asked to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on March 16, 1988, and thought he'd give the same talk. `` My staff told me that would n't work. These were kids who had failed two or three years and were going to drop out of school,'' he said. `` They said they were in a salvage operation and I was supposed to try to convince them to stay in school and graduate.'' What <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> saw at the school were young men and women who were totally tuned out. But he got their attention: `` I laid it on pretty thick. I went in my full regalia, <PERSON> Rolex </PERSON> and all. I talked about my racing boats and ranches and I told them how I got it _ through hard work and a college education. I told them I had one advantage they did n't. I was white and in East <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when I was young that was important. I also told them it does n't make that much difference now. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> also told them that if they would make a `` B'' or better in high school, he would pay for their college education. `` It was the first time I realized that they did n't have that opportunity before I gave it to them. I had always thought anyone who had the grades could go to college. I was wrong.'' One of the students in that group was <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` I did n't think he could do it at first That's a lot of money. My folks were in shock too. There are five of us kids and when Mr. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he'd pay for my college they were some happy,'' said <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who hopes to become a political cartoonist. `` My attitude has really changed,'' said <PERSON> Clenard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pruitt </PERSON>, another of the students. `` Used to be I did n't study that much. Now I have a plan to go to college and then go into real estate. That's where the money is.'' The `` Taylor Plan'' that grew out of <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s revelation would let <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> students attend college based solely on ability to learn. It would require four-year colleges to adopt minimum admission standards. Each qualified student whose family income is less than $ 30,000 a year would be guaranteed a college education with tuition, fees, room and board costs all waived. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> put the cost of the program at $ 20 million the first year, and believes the savings it would generate would pay for it. Simply eliminating remedial courses at four-year schools because of the admission standards would save millions, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees nine regional colleges, and the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> have accepted the plan. It officially goes into effect in 1993, but both boards have said any student meeting the academic requirements this fall will have fees and tuition waived at 13 colleges. Those costs will be absorbed by the colleges. A bill is pending in the Legislature to cover those costs and room and board when the program officially begins. Officials, like <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, believe that the program will be self-sustaining. As proof of what his plan can do, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> points to the 172 who took him up on his college offer at <ORGANIZATION> Livingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> last year. A year later, none have dropped out or gotten into drugs, there's been one pregnancy and one arrest, and the rest are all maintaining a `` B'' average or better. `` The biggest thing the program has done is keep these kids in school. Most of them would have dropped out by now if Mr. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had n't stepped in,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who supervises the program. `` These are kids who had failed at least twice, maybe three times. They came from broken homes, had behavior problems, attitude problems, many of them just were n't wanted by anyone.'' `` It means a lot to me,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` I know what it's like to be poor and be afraid you wo n't be able to get the education. I know the fear of thinking you might miss the chance to be all you can be. `` Can you think of anything worse than to be bright and be condemned to a life of menial work?''

<TEXT>
 Will PKE become the <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> of the future? The new production venture is a product of the unlikely partnership of <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON>, creator of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s wise-cracking puppet star `` ALF,'' and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, producer of such serious, made-for-television fare as `` The Attic: The Hiding of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'' and `` In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders.'' The `` PKE'' in PKE Productions stands for Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment. <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, named for co-founder <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, is the company that became legendary for such high-quality hits as `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show,'' `` Hill Street Blues'' and `` St. Elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> worked there with partner <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> on several series, including `` The <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> Show.'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> met when they teamed up a few years ago on `` Washingtoon,'' a short-lived, political-satire cable series. They remained in touch, though their paths diverged. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> recalled that on the day he got approval for `` Anastasia,'' a two-part movie for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> got the go-ahead for `` ALF.'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> has independently produced `` ALF'' since its premiere three seasons ago, but with success under his belt, he began to think big. `` I asked <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>, how do you run a company?'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> said in an interview in <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s office at their new company headquarters in suburban <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The best company I ever worked for was <ORGANIZATION> MTM </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinker </PERSON> was there, and we just had a wonderful creative bunch of people and there were five, six shows going at one time, and it was really wonderful. But you've got to be a manager to do that at the top someplace. I knew <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> could run a company, and I asked him for his advice, and sort of couched in that was the invitation to sort of go in together.'' In March, PKE was still a chain of sparsely furnished offices in a non-descript building. `` When I came in here Jan. 3, there was me and the answering machine,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said. `` On the answering machine, it said, ` Hello, this is Patchett-Kaufman Entertainment. We're not here right now. Could you please leave a message?' And the first message I got was him -LRB- <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> -RRB- calling, saying, ` Hello. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s not there? Well, I'm <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON>, and I'm not there. You guys must be doing very well.''' But <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> proudly showed off the stadium-sized warehouse soon to be filled with soundstages and dressing rooms and the bustle of work on new projects ranging from a fact-based movie about the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, racial attack to `` Working Girl,'' a new <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> sitcom based on the hit movie of the same name. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, who recently moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had made a name producing Important-with-a-capital-I movies with his late partner, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lepiner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> had a string of critical if not ratings successes with <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON>, including <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Buffalo Bill.'' The strain of the series split up the partnership. <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> went on to create the offbeat dramedies `` The Days and Nights of <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'' and `` The ` Slap' Maxwell Story.'' <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> went on to `` ALF,'' his first bona fide ratings hit. The show has spawned an industry of stuffed toys, lunch boxes and other `` ALF'' paraphernalia. No one, apparently, was more surprised by its almost instantaneous success than was <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON>: `` The scary part is the responsibility that comes with a hit like that. ... When you get phone calls that, you know, a husband is dying and he's in a coma and the only thing he responds to is ALF ... and somebody dies and they bury the kid with an ALF doll or cap ... you got ta be careful. It's very _ you begin to feel what humanity is all about, because you have such power.'' PKE's logo is a house, which <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> describes as symbolizing a protective roof over the heads of the creative types he and <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON> hope to attract. It's to some extent the house that `` ALF'' built. `` ` ALF' is affording this venture,'' said <PERSON> Patchett </PERSON>. `` It's not bankrolling it, but it's certainly made it possible for me to do something that I had n't thought of being able to do before.''

 <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON> is well aware that he's part of a long line of actors who have played the legendary outlaw <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> the Kid. `` I think even <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> played him,'' said <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON>. Actually, <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> is one of the few who never played Billy the Kid. <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> was in `` The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kid </LOCATION>,'' `` The Frisco Kid'' and `` The <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kid </LOCATION>,'' but he never played Billy the Kid. <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON>, best-known for his roles as <PERSON> Madmartigan </PERSON> in the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> myth-fantasy `` Willow'' and as the hotshot pilot Iceman in the <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> hit `` Top Gun,'' turns in an intriguing performance as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> in the new <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telvision </ORGANIZATION> cable movie `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s Billy the Kid,'' premiering Wednesday. This latest retelling of the events of the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> war in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territory </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>'s slaying at the age of 21 by Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> in 1881 is <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s attempt to make good on the skewed vision of <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> contained in the 1958 film `` The Left Handed Gun.'' Based on a teleplay by <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>, it starred <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>. Others who have played <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> the Kid include <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Audie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Crabbe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kristofferson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buetel </PERSON> in `` The Outlaw,'' which shocked in 1943 because of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s cleavage. Most recently, <PERSON> Bonney </PERSON> was played by <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON> in `` Young Guns.'' `` Most writers find their finds in other mythical renditions of the subject,'' said <PERSON> Kilmer </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> is quite passionate about this. He got squeezed out as producer of ` The Left Handed Gun.' Actually, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> used both hands. `` I have a special interest, too, because my grandfather came from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to mine gold in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was still wild. Once five men rode up to their mine, and my grandfather's friends opened fire and killed them all.'' If the new film does n't beatify <PERSON> Billy </PERSON>, it does portray him as immensely sympathetic.

 First-time homebuyers often are appalled by the number of fees and charges, such as for credit checks, appraisals and pest inspections, that must be paid at the closing. Watch out, say some mortgage bankers, lest your real estate agent slip in still another, a referral fee, or a charge for having steered you to the lender who agrees to finance the purchase. That issue has set off a conflict in an industry where builders, sellers and lenders often see eye to eye, often taking the same stand on legislative and other matters in which they have a mutual interest. They do n't agree on referral fees, or the practice of sales agents using their influence with lenders to obtain mortgages and then charging homebuyers a fee for the service. `` You should be aware of them,'' says <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are fees you do n't need to pay for services you do n't need to have.'' That is n't quite the way the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> sees things. `` We are opposed to naked referrals,'' says <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, explaining that such a referral is one in which the Realtor does little more than supply a name. But when the Realtor does something more, she said, a fee is justified. `` We believe our position is forthright and honest. It's not something unethical, as the mortgage bankers seem to imply,'' she said. With changing technology, she explained, agents are more involved in the mortgage origination process. Increasingly, real estate agents offer a computerized service in which the homebuyer, without leaving the real estate office, may obtain a review of the loan offerings and interest rates of mortgage providers active in the area. Is that a `` naked referral?'' It's hard to say. To simply provide the name of a bank active in mortgage lending is naked. But any activity beyond that is a cloudy area, one that appears to involve a matter of judgment. Says <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>: `` Lenders have special deals with certain real estate agents _ meaning the real estate agent has a special interest in not only completing the home sale, but in where the borrower gets a loan. As he sees it, and has so stated in material prepared for the media and distributed as a pamphlet, `` real estate agents can make extra income by using certain lenders, even though that lender's mortgage rates may be higher. It's not just the free market at work, he says. Homebuyers may pay an additional fee to the real estate agent of up to $ 1,000 on a $ 100,000 mortgage `` for no service, just for ` referring' the borrower to a lender.'' There's more to it than that, says <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>. Not only does the borrower pay a fee, but there's a chance the borrower might also pay a half percentage point over market because the lender must recover money paid to the agent. He calls some referral programs `` blatant and illegal kickbacks to real estate agents,'' and he fears that in a competitive marketplace they will flourish, with one agency or lender copying the other. According to <PERSON> Gourley </PERSON>, who also is vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, one lender's printed promotional flyer offers real estate agents as much as $ 120,000 a year for referrals. Other programs, he says, offer luxury trips to exotic sites. He calls for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act quickly to end referral practices. Otherwise, he says, `` the integrity of the mortgage market will be damaged.'' End Adv PMs Monday, May 8

 Japanese companies are using third countries as channels to reduce direct imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and avert criticism that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade supports the apartheid system, trade experts and anti-apartheid activists say. `` Japanese imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> fell only because it -LRB- <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- imported South African gold and platinum indirectly through third countries such as <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsila </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a group seeking to overthrow the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> government. Foreign Ministry officials have emphasized the government opposes the apartheid system of racial segregation but said there was no legal way to prevent companies from using third countries as conduits for South African products. In 1987, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s No. 1 trading partner, surpassing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As a result the Japanese came under heavy criticism for giving economic support to apartheid. In June last year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was singled out in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution criticizing its increased trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The government in early 1988 asked trading companies to practice self-restraint in trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and then was pleased when trade figures announced in January showed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was no longer <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s biggest trading partner, having fallen behind <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s two-way trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1988 declined 3.5 percent from 1987 to $ 3.98 billion. But detailed official statistics show the drop in overall trade was largely due to a drastic decline in imports of precious metals from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Although exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> grew 9.8 percent in 1988 from the previous year, imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> fell 14.5 percent, due to a 40.7 percent decline in the dollar value of platinum imports and an 84.3 percent drop in the dollar value of gold imports. Critics and scholars closely following the controversy say that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> only shifted its source of platinum and gold from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to third countries, many of which import these precious metals from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Customs clearance statistics show <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imports of gold and platinum from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> jumped dramatically. By weight, gold imports from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1988 jumped 80.9 percent from the previous year while gold from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> increased by 19.8 percent. Platinum imports from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> more than doubled, those from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were up more than 700 percent, and those from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> were 27 times higher than the previous year. `` It is common knowledge that neither <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> produces gold or platinum,'' said <PERSON> Yoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitazawa </PERSON>, an author who has also researched Japanese uranium purchases from southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It is obvious that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is changing labels of South African gold and platinum to those of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> when those precious metals go to exchanges in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and registering them as British and Swiss gold and platinum.'' Foreign Ministry officials said Japanese companies may have used third countries to produce lower figures for imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But `` you ca n't really prove'' how much of the imports from third countries are South African products, said <PERSON> Yasufumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotake </PERSON>, who works on one of the ministry's <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> desks. `` I am not sure if we can single out Japanese companies and blame them for switching the sources of imports,'' he said. `` Legally, there is not really any way to prevent Japanese companies from importing South African products from third countries.'' <PERSON> Kotake </PERSON> stressed that `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is doing what she can do. And we need cooperation from other European countries and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to make it a concerted effort.'' But <PERSON> Matsila </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> representative, charged that `` what <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is doing is hiding the origin of its imports. What it eventually got out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1988 was considerably more than that of 1987 if you include those indirectly imported products.'' Government statistics show <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s two-way trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1988, excluding gold and platinum, actually increased 8.1 percent from the previous year. Most Japanese firms involved in gold and platinum trading declined to comment. But one official of <ORGANIZATION> Tanaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest platinum supplier, said, `` We have been only using non-South African platinum such as from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for years. We are not prepared to discuss the matter right now.'' An expert on the precious metals market, requesting anonymity, said: `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has grown into the world's largest platinum market because of its growing demand for jewelry and as a means of investment, as well as for industrial use. Only South African platinum can fulfill <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s large demands.'' Statistics show <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imported about 70 percent of the world's total platinum output in 1988, while <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> produced about 80 percent of the total output The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> produce the remaining 20 percent.

<HEAD>Charge of Faked Utrillos Shakes Art Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>, the prolific painter who immortalized peaceful <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> street scenes, was plagued by counterfeiters _ first in life and now in death, his widow's sole heir says. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON>, 58, is waging war against the alleged fakes, accusing art dealers, auctioneers and experts of putting profit before art. Critics of his efforts claim he's the one who is after money. He disrupted auction sales in April at both <ORGANIZATION> Christies </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, crying `` Fake, fake.'' He was removed from the auction houses, and the sales of the 17 contested Utrillos went ahead. His campaign scored a tentative victory in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> when he persuaded a criminal court judge to confiscate seven alleged Utrillo paintings valued at more than $ 1 million from well-known <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> auctioneer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON>. Verification of the disputed paintings will be handled by a court-appointed panel of experts. A final decision is not expected until early summer. <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> has also challenged the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market. He has written to <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s threatening court action if they do not withdraw nine Utrillos to be sold by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s on May 10 and six more by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s on May 11. `` We're not surprised to learn that he is once again attempting to promote unfounded allegations in the press,'' said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, a vice president and director of corporate affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` As we previously stated, and as the courts in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> have also found, Mr. <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> is not a recognized expert in <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>'s works. We have notified him that we stand by our authentication of the works in our sale and that we intend to offer them for sale on the date scheduled and that if he interferes in our sale, we will take whatever action we think approbriate to protect <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s and our consignors' rights.'' The seven Utrillos in the April 4 <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> sale fetched over 1 million pounds -LRB- $ 1.68 million -RRB-. <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>'s naive street scenes, with their fine sense of atmosphere and composition, have become synonymous with <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and especially with artists' haunts in <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> such as the famed old music hall `` Le Lapin Agile.'' <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>, who died in 1955 at the age of 72, was known to have been copied widely during his lifetime. Locked into an unusually tight agreement to sell his work solely through his dealer, he reportedly sold paintings on the sly to support his increasingly debilitating alcohol habit. `` Later, when the paintings would surface, he would simply say they were fakes,'' <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON> said in an interview. `` That was his way of getting extra money.'' <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON>, who was called a `` longtime devoted friend'' by <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> <PERSON> Valore </PERSON>, when she amended her will to leave everything to him, claims that in addition to the 3,500-4 ,000 original Utrillo paintings in museums and private collections, at least 3,500 fakes are circulating worldwide `` Technically, it would have been impossible for <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> to paint more than the paintings which have been cataloged,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> said some of the contested paintings were probably the work of Valore, also an artist but less gifted than her husband. `` <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> did n't paint much during the last 10 years of his life,'' he said. `` She would paint, he would sign and that way, madame could have her jewels, her hairdresser and they could keep up their high living.'' The disputed works in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> court case are `` <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION>,'' `` La Chaumiere d'Henri IV a <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION>,'' `` Rue Saint-Rustique et le <ORGANIZATION> Sacre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` La <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortot </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION>,'' `` Le Moulin de la Galette'' and two works entitled `` Le Lapin Agile.'' <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> says he determined they were fakes after studying enlargements of details from reproductions printed in the sales catalog. `` The signatures are not normal. The letters are hesitating and overdone, sure signs that they're fakes, when you know that <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> signed his name automatically, in a single gesture,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> never looked like the painting entitled ` La <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortot </PERSON>.' It may be a street in <LOCATION> Saint-Tropez </LOCATION>, but it's not the <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> loved to paint.'' <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> said he can only guess why <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> was copied so much more extensively than his contemporaries _ <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Seurat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlaminck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Braque </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON> _ who also lived and worked in <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> in the early 1900s. `` That's part of the Utrillo mystery. He painted authentic street scenes that captured local people in their daily life. They became stereotypes symbolizing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION>, especially for foreigners,'' he said. `` It was a curse in life, and now a curse in death.'' <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON> and other auctioneers claim <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> has hurt the future sale of <LOCATION> Utrillos </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where the market already is struggling to compete with other European capitals where sales taxes are lower and regulations on export licenses less restrictive. `` People will take their Utrillos elsewhere,'' <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON> said, adding that British auction houses sell $ 200 million to $ 300 million in French paintings each year. <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhamel </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said two Utrillos were withdrawn from a May 3 sale in <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION> at the request of the owners. <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, however, stood by its judgment that they were authentic. <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON> and other art world insiders accuse <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> of trying to replace the existing catalog documenting the painter's complete works. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrides </PERSON>, <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON>'s dealer and long considered among the world's most reliable experts, compiled it. `` <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> wants the last word. He wants authentication to go through him _ and for a price,'' <PERSON> Loudmer </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON> is simply trying to ` get a piece of the Utrillo cake,' which is quite extensive. `` I have no doubt whatsover on the attribution of these seven paintings, all of which have been examined closely by numerous experts.'' But <PERSON> Fabris </PERSON>, who says he has spent 15 years sifting through some 50,000 catalogs tracking down original <PERSON> Utrillo </PERSON> works, says he is sure the works are fakes. `` The police laboratory analyses will vindicate me, and this will turn out to be the biggest art scandal of the century,'' he said. `` French experts are a joke. Experts, dealers, auctioneers are all in it together. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> art market needs to be purged.''

 Move over, <PERSON> Grover </PERSON>. It's a squirt, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bert </PERSON>. Hear the word, Big Bird? `` Sesame Street'' is having a baby. After 20 years of entertaining preschoolers, the public television show is creating one of its own. The peewee set is all a-quiver; no television birth has been more eagerly awaited since <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was born to <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> in 1953. Two of the show's characters, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, married at the end of last season; on Friday, in this season's finale, their baby will be born and introduced to the neighbors and the world. Details of the blessed event are closely guarded. Those who know the child's sex are sworn to secrecy _ wild cookie monsters could not drag the information from this reporter _ and even the circumstances of the couple's trip to the hospital are not being divulged. `` Everybody's at their wit's end, and they ca n't get there. ... Oscar -LRB- the Grouch -RRB- goes through some changes,'' said <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. Young viewers will not see the actual delivery. `` Obviously, you ca n't show something like this. It's too scary,'' Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON> said. Few subjects are too scary for `` Sesame Street.'' One of the show's original cast members, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, died in 1983. Rather than allowing <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s character, kindly Mr. <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>, to retire in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the show's writers chose to have him die and use his demise as a way of discussing death. But `` in the early years of the show, we were advised that we should not have a child'' born on `` Sesame Street,'' said producer <PERSON> Dulcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. The concept was too complicated and would interfere with the mission of teaching the alphabet and numbers, the show's advisers said In its 18th year, the show broached the subject when characters <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> adopted a child, Miles. Then, when Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON> married in real life, she discussed with Ms. Singer the possibility of her becoming pregnant while appearing on the show. Ms. <PERSON> Monzano </PERSON> did have a baby 13 months ago. Her pregnancy inspired the `` Sesame Street'' storyline; she wrote many of the episodes involving pregnancy and childbirth, using her experience as a guide. She was aided by the legendary `` Sesame Street'' research team, which surveyed 60 pre-schoolers to find out what they knew about pregnancy. The answer, said research director <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON>, was not much. To start, they did not understand the word `` pregnancy,'' and, explained <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON>, `` We wanted to define pregnancy as when a woman has a baby growing in her body.'' But where? The children did not understand the word `` womb''; it sounded like `` room.'' And `` tummy'' was inaccurate. In the end, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> described the baby's location as `` a special place,'' and she pointed to it. Unsurprisingly, the children did not know how women became pregnant. Ultimately, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> explained that when he and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> got married, they decided to have a family and start a baby growing in <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s body. `` We do n't get into sex education. That's something we leave to the parents,'' said Ms. Singer. Most preschoolers knew that only women have children, and that pregnant women should eat `` good food'' to nourish their baby. Most did n't mention milk, so a point was made of having <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> drink milk often. Most knew that the baby moved inside its mother, although one 3-year-old asserted that the fetus dances. But most did n't realize that women went to the doctor regularly throughout their pregnancies. This gave `` Sesame Street'' an opportunity to plug prenatal care throughout <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s pregnancy. `` If nothing else, we get little nags into the home,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lovelace </PERSON> said. In one episode, Big Bird accompanied <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> to the obstetrician. The expectant mothers and their doctor seemed unfazed by the presence of an eight-foot-tall yellow fowl in the office. `` Who is this _ a friend or a relative?'' the doctor asked. When <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> complains she is tired, <PERSON> Big </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> says he, too, tires sometimes and asks if that means he is pregnant. Only ladies get pregnant, he is told. `` I knew that,'' he replies. When the doctor amplifies the fetal heartbeat, Big Bird is exultant. `` Big Bird sort of represents our audience,'' said Ms. Singer. When a test group of toddlers screened the heartbeat episode, they watched in awe. Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>, who has been on the show 17 years, looks forward to next year. In addition to forays into geography and ecology, `` Sesame Street'' will use <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s baby to discuss the care and feeding of an infant. At first, a newborn will play the role. But eventually, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s baby will be played by Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>'s baby, thus solving Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON>'s childcare worries `` It's a wonderful situation to be in, but I never thought my own child would upstage me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Manzano </PERSON> said with a laugh.

 The hopeful, the desperate, the adventurers have come in hordes, swamping this tiny community on the shores of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. Weary-looking women and men with work-scarred hands loiter near job agencies, waiting for the miracle _ a $ 16.67-an-hour, back-breaking job sopping up the nation's worst oil spill. In a few weeks they have doubled the population of this town _ and still they come. `` It's not often you can go out and make good money,'' says <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a homesteader from near <LOCATION> Tok </LOCATION>. She has been living in an old van covered by a plastic tarp to keep out the rain. `` There are just so many people, you have to wait your turn.'' City officials and others wonder how long the city can handle the crush. Before the Exxon Valdez rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24 and dumped almost 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound, <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> counted about 3,500 residents. Now, the number is about 7,000 and climbing daily. The impact is severe. Businesses can not find or keep help as workers seek better-paying <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> jobs. Hotels are jammed, additional housing in non-existent and parks are being cleared of snow to open early for camping. Garbage collections have doubled. Water consumption has increased by 1 million gallons a day as scores of cleanup vessels tap the city supply. `` It's going to get worse,'' says Public Works Director <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlitz </PERSON>. Burger King has wheeled in a portable fast-food restaurant, complete with roped off drive-in lane. City licensing officials say it may not be the last such portable unit. The <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> has added 108 long-distance lines to keep up. `` It's been tough,'' says <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the utility's general manager. `` We've had to meet growth in the last 30 days that was n't even anticipated over five years.'' Arrests last month jumped by 500 percent over April 1988, and police are working overtime, says <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON>, the city's chief of emergency services. `` We're running them ragged. We had $ 25,000 -LRB- budgeted -RRB- for overtime for the year. We used that up the first week,'' he says. `` Our bar fights, domestic disturbances, street fights, they're way up.'' Arrests for drunken driving haved quadrupled over the same period last year. Ambulance calls have increased 100 percent, <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> says. The statistics, instead of improving, are getting a little worse each week, he adds. `` That has us worried.'' Prostitution seems unable to get a foothold, although two new prostitutes arrived after the spill to set up shop, <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON> says. `` Most of the people coming here are not working and do n't have much money. Business apparently was not that good and they left on their own.'' The impact also has been felt at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Community </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where emergency room activity has increased at least 100 percent, says administrator <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. She says she has lost her two lab technicians because of the spill and can not find replacements. One quit to work with oiled otters; the other was dissatisfied with post-spill <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, she says. `` A lot of people just do n't like this town anymore,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> says. At the city's bustling waterfront, harbor officials can barely keep up. `` General confusion is the best way to put it,'' says Harbormaster <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. The spill has increased harbor use by cleanup vessels, support boats and floatplanes, he says. `` It's going to get a lot worse than this,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> says. `` The recreational fleet has n't even put into the water yet. And the commercial fleet will be coming.'' Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> says <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has started to feel the effect on its $ 32 million annual budget, but he says there are other problems. `` I think people are getting uncomfortable,'' he says. `` The quality of life is certainly not as good as in normal times.'' The city gets most of its income from taxes on oil industry facilities. <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> says <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has been struggling for the last few years to face the fact that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION> oil is not inexhaustible. Officials and business leaders have put money and effort into diversifying the city's economy, and the spill may damage that effort, he says. `` We're not sure what the effect will be. This is not good for tourism, not good for fishing, not good for our port. We have not gotten much sympathy from <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Devens </PERSON> says the city's relationship with oil companies may cool because of the spill. `` They've never given scholarships, never built any city parks. They really have n't done much except provide a tax base. They've done that not because of generosity, but because it's the law `` The slate is getting kind of balanced.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> without <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>? For some _ especially <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, the opinionated mayor of the past 11 years _ it's hard to picture. For others, including at least six who want the job, it's easy. And polls and pundits seem to agree: Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is in trouble. After four years of scandals, homelessness, AIDS, crack, crime and crumbling bridges, many New Yorkers think their No. 1 loudmouth has gone from lovable to laughable to lose-able. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 64, acknowledges he's not the same man who went from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>, the mayor's residence, in 1977: `` I'm not any smarter _ I'm wiser, I hope I'm more beaten up. I'm just as resilient in terms of coming off the mat and fighting back.'' For much of the country, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is the book-writing, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> Trump-taunting, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson-jeering </PERSON> embodiment of the essential New Yorker _ obstinate, obnoxious, smart and sort of entertaining. Talks too much. At home, polls show his Democratic voter support straining to reach 30 percent; half of the voters disapprove of his performance. He'd lose a four-way race for the Democratic nomination, the polls say, and even if he won, he would be defeated by a Republican, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. But those are just scientific newspaper polls. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said his own show-of-hands polls at his public appearances indicate otherwise. `` I think there is a reservoir of great goodwill out there and appreciation for what I've done.'' Others might disagree. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is `` on the ropes'' -LRB- Wall Street Journal -RRB- and his third term `` a shambles'' -LRB- Vanity Fair -RRB-, partly because of his `` mean-spirited, gratuitous, bullying egocentricity'' -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> magazine -RRB-. And those were relatively even-handed articles. In the bookstores is `` City for Sale,'' 466 pages dense with details of the corruption scandals that tainted everyone from borough presidents to the <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION> chef, who used city equipment for his catering business. Newspapers offer daily doses of criticism _ <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> says he's `` the whipping post for about six or eight columnists.'' And a black newspaper, the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> News, has called for his resignation on its front page for more than 160 weeks. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, however, is planning to become the city's first four-term mayor. The primary election is Sept. 12. `` Now, I do n't expect to get the 78 percent majority I got in 1985. That was unique _ the highest in the history of the city. But all I need is 51. And I hope to get even better than that,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. His main challenger for the Democratic nomination is <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who leads the polls and would be the first black mayor. Two other Democrats expected to run are city Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON>, a builder who has headed the state <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. Waiting to take on the survivor is <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who earned a crime-busting aura by prosecuting mobsters, Wall Streeters and corrupt officials. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is faced by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, an heir to the <PERSON> Estee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> cosmetics fortune who was ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I'm the underdog, and I'm not saying that to get sympathy. All the polls show it,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. What they really show, he feels, is vague dissatisfaction and annoyance with the guy who's been on the television for 12 years. `` My friends and supporters have said, ` Listen, one of the things that people say they do n't like _ in the sense that they once did _ is your feistiness. So tune it down,''' he said. `` I'm trying You'll notice my voice is two octaves lower. I'm practicing And I speak slow.'' `` The problem for <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, `` is that many of his opponents embody a compelling rationale against him. `` <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> can credibly argue that he is a quiet healer, not a nasty loudmouth dividing our city. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> can credibly argue that he is a fresh face who will clean up the city, unlike the mayor who looked the other way. `` <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> is a Koch without the sleaze or the shtick. He's smart, experienced and nervy. <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON> can persuasively argue that he's an experienced builder who can run without the baggage of being a clubhouse politician.'' None has to defend an administration in which six officials appointed by the mayor have gone to jail or been indicted and 200 low-level officials have been charged with wrongdoing. `` I accept full responsibility for everything, good and bad, in my administration,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` And I say to people: When you judge me, judge me on what you would have done before and what you would have done after. And did I do what makes common sense?'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> speaks with pride of his administration's accomplishments: hundreds of millions spent on the homeless, a $ 5.1 billion program to create 53,000 new and rehabilitated apartments by 1993, millions being spent on Tactical Narcotics Teams of police officers who focus on drug-ridden neighborhoods. `` No city does what we do. We get no credit for it. There is a gap between substance and what people perceive,'' he said, admitting however that the perception is distorted by his combative nature and sarcasm. `` It may be that people have come to the conclusion that people do n't want that sense of humor and other personality aspects,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` ` Time for a change' is the No. 1 cardinal slogan when you have someone who's been there for two terms. I've been there for three terms. That does n't mean I should n't be there for a fourth term.''

 Major American retailers are benefiting from a turnaround in women's apparel sales, which helped produce a modest boost in business at several chain stores during April. Department stores and specialty apparel merchants generally had good news to report in results issued Thursday. Women's clothing sales continued to rebound from last year's low levels and analysts cited keen interest in career wardrobes as one cause. Among the apparel-oriented merchants that posted decent sales were: <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based department-store operator; <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> owner of department stores and discount home and shoe shops; <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Dallas-based nationwide chain; and, <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has specialty apparel shops and is based in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> One big general merchandise retailer reported a negative impact on business from early April's colder-than-normal weather in many parts of the country, particularly the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northest </LOCATION>. But the retailer, Troy, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest chain store in the country, said sales of things such as spring and summer clothing, do-it-yourself gadgetry, patio furniture, barbecue grills and other outdoor gear improved as the weather warmed up during the second half of April. Meanwhile, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was pleased with its take. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, which is banking on a new low-pricing policy to boost customer traffic, also benefited from the rollout of its Brand Central superstores. Helped by the marketing of more national brands alongside its flagship <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION> label, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' sales of home electronics and appliances rose by double-digit percentages in April. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the April numbers looked good overall partly because they were being compared with last year's depressed tallies. Still, he said, April represented a significant improvement from March's very sluggish volumes. `` This in an indication that the consumer is not dead, spending is just slowing down,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. Expenditures on things that are typically financed with bank loans have been curbed a bit by increases in interest rates this year. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said sales industry-wide this year have barely outpaced the inflation rate, indicating that consumer spending, a key element in economic growth, is easing. <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON> has scaled down his forecast for average 1989 retail sales growth to 5.5 percent from 6 percent, based on sales results so far this year. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said one of the positive factors in this year's retail equation is that big chains have refrained from slashing prices to clear out slow-moving goods This, combined with tight inventory management, will help preserve profitability in the retail business. The results Thursday were from some of the biggest general merchandise chains in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including purveyors of special apparel lines and accessories. Monthly retail sales figures from the government are more comprehensive and include the take at other types of establishments such as auto dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants. Here are some of the figures: Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said its sales rose 9.2 percent in the four weeks ended April 29 from the comparable 1988 period and sales at stores open at least a year, called same or comparable store sales, rose 6.8 percent. Retailers and industry analysts consider same-store sales a more accurate indication of a company's performance than totals that include sales at newly opened stores. Not every retailer reports same-store sales. K mart said its sales in the four weeks to April 26 were up 2.3 percent but, on a same-store basis, sales fell 1 percent. The third-largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said its April sales rose 25 percent while its same-store sales gained 11 percent. The fast-growing discounter, based in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, routinely reports double-digit same-store sales growth.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> says too much bureaucracy could hinder the mop-up of the nation's worst oil spill and denied the company was trying to cut corners in the cleanup At a news conference Thursday in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said that as many as 14 government agencies may be involved in approving and carrying out <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s final cleanup plan. `` I want some one person in charge _ I do n't care who it is _ because there has to be one person that finally says ` hey, it's midnight and we got ta do something And here's what we're going to do.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was continuing to operate under a plan approved April 17 by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> until a revised plan is given the go-ahead. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> submitted the latest proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Monday after portions of the current plan were criticized as inadequate. The oil tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> crashed into a reef March 24, spilling more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Price William Sound. Exxon accepted responsibility for the spill but has been criticized for dragging its feet in its initial response to the disaster. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> defended the latest proposal, _ which he said was formulated with the help of state and federal environmental officials _ despite ongoing criticism by some state regulators. The proposal calls for cleaning up 364 miles of shoreline by Sept. 15. He also rejected reports alleging that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was attempting to bypass environmental regulations to dispose of waste accumulated from the spill. The first page of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s new waste disposal plan calls for use of existing treatment and disposal facilities at the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>. `` Use of the Alyeska facilities will also require cooperation from the regulatory agencies to rapidly issue letters of non-objection, waivers, or permit modifications as required,'' the plan says. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said, however, that the wording was misinterpreted and that `` everything can be accomplished within environmental laws.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> would do `` anything reasonable'' to cleanse <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s soiled waters and beaches and that it placed the cleanup of 191 miles of lightly oil beaches last on the list of priorities after consultations with environmental officials. He said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> would clean even those areas, except in cases, particularly wildlife habitats, judged better left untouched. `` Anything that makes sense that they would say you ought to do in addition to what you have in the plan, we'll do it,'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>Commodities Markets Provide Outlet For Wild Financial Speculation</BYLINE>
<HEAD>With PM-Commodities Probe, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet millions of dollars on the future prices of goods ranging from gold to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills to frozen orange juice. The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of price fluctuations from people who do n't want the risk, such as farmers or metals processors, to speculators who are willing to gamble on making big profits. Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified price at a certain time in the future. Options, which also are widely traded on the exchanges, give purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell something at a certain price within a specified period. Commodities traders, standing in recessed `` pits'' and dressed in brightly colored jackets, shout orders and wave hand signals to each other in a free - for-all auction of contracts In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who wants to lock in a guaranteed price to minimize risk will promise to deliver 20,000 pounds of live beef cattle at a specified future date at a specified price. Assuming the price rises, the speculator who buys the contract could later take the cattle from the farmer and resell them to someone else at the higher prevailing market price, pocketing the profit. But if the price goes down, the speculator would lose money by having to pay the farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the cattle at the lower market price. In practice, speculators rarely end up with mountains of tin or pork bellies _ they sell their positions at a profit or loss before the delivery date. The ultimate buyer is a customer who actually needs the commodity. Although the exchanges began with agricultural products, they have rapidly expanded into financial products. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> does most of its business in contracts based on the value of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock indexes. Other major exchanges include the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Oil Drillers Union Seeks Moratorium on Arctic Refuge Drilling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The union that represents oil workers nationwide has announced its opposition to drilling in the coastal plains of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>. The Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says a moratorium on drilling in the environmentally sensitive refuge is not antithetical to its members' need to work. `` I'm for drilling, but there has to be some sanity to the process, and there does n't seem to be any,'' <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wages </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Saying you should n't drill in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> ought not be viewed as religious heresy by the industry,'' Wages said. He said union leaders are on the stump to rally support for a cohesive national energy policy. Previously, the union was neutral on coastal drilling, although the membership had passed several resolutions asking its leadership to be sensitive to both jobs and the environment. But when the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 and spilled 250,000 gallons of crude oil into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, union opposition galvanized. The stance `` is certainly not jobs-producing, but we do n't believe it's jobs-destructive either,'' Wages said The union, which represents about 40,000 oil workers and 70,000 chemical and atomic workers, is pushing for more effective recovery of oil at existing fields rather than exploratory drilling in environmentally sensitive areas. Wages conceded that enhanced recovery is more expensive than searching for new gushers. `` No one is forcing the industry to make the hard judgments about spending the money that's required for secondary recovery,'' he said. `` We have a lot of fields out there that have not been flooded, that have not been steam injected. The oil is sitting there.'' He also mentioned the extraction of oil from shale, a type of rock, as an alternative to coastal exploration. `` Exxon was one of the promoters of the oil shale projects out where I come from, in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>,'' Wages said. `` And one bright sunshiny day they just picked up, closed down and told everybody they were laid off. But they would have the American public, the press, the government and everyone believe that it's absolutely essential to drill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Why? Because no one will take the economic positions that have to be taken to develop other sources.'' Wages also ridiculed industry and government officials who say coastal drilling is essential for national security. `` That is a specious argument. It's inconsistent with the facts,'' Wages said. There are no government restrictions on oil imports and as a result, imports of both crude oil and refined products such as gasoline, heating oil and distillate oils are approaching historic highs, he said. At the same time, record numbers of American refineries have been shut down in the last five years. `` We do n't have enough refining capacity to meet demand ... based on how much we are importing,'' Wages said. `` All of the positions that the industry and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are taking are inconsistent with national security,'' Wages said. `` National security is not served by the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian-Texaco </LOCATION> joint venture. It's not served by the Venezuelans' joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Champlin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like saying we wo n't let the Soviets work in our defense plants, but we'll let the Soviet government operate them.'' Wages hopes to win support before the memory of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> fades. `` We'd like <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take up the nation's energy policy now, before the ghost of the Valdez is gone,'' he said. `` Because as long as that ghost is there, there's not going to be drilling up there. When that ghost disappears there will be a subtle, quiet, subterranean move to make sure that they are permitted to drill.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, the quintessential wheeler-dealer, faces a new kind of board in his newest venture, `` Trump The Game.'' The real estate mogul has joined forces with board game manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which expects the game to be the biggest seller in its 129-year history. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> flew in his private helicopter to <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> headquarters here Thursday to fulfill a promise to the company. `` They were intent on having me come up to meet the real people,'' he said. `` These are the people doing the work. To hell with the executives.'' Many of the 2,300 workers at the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> factory clapped at each stop in the 45-minute visit, women sighed `` Is n't he handsome? and men lined up for autographs of the paper money that bears his likeness and comes in denominations no smaller than $ 10 million. More than 2 million of the games are scheduled for production by year's end. It is the No. 1 seller in the 300 stores that have received advance copies, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditomassi </PERSON> said. Neither the company nor <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will reveal his royalties, but both said he is donating proceeds to charities for the homeless and for research into AIDS, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. The board game is a sophisticated battle in which players first bid against each other _ using the fake cash and <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> cards, of course _ for airlines, casinos, luxury hotels and other Trump properties, then try to negotiate deals. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said the game is tough even for a veteran of the high-stakes business world like him, but he resisted explaining its appeal. `` If I said it, you'd say I have a big ego, so why say it?'' The idea for the game came from an independent inventor from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who suggested <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as the manufacturer. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he settled on the nation's largest board game maker because `` the loyalty, decisiveness and professionalism of this company is just unbelievable.'' As the applause died down, he barked at workers: `` OK, get some overtime.'' During a news conference later, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> denied rumors that he planned to run for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which had surfaced after he took out a full-page newspaper advertisement recently supporting the death penalty and increased police presence. And he sneered at the suggestion that a new bidder for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> shuttle could affect his $ 365 million offer. `` It's not serious,'' he said of the bid from <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I have not even heard of them.'' Besides, he said, his contract with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> guarantees him a lot of money even if the deal falls through.

 Profitless pecan producers have expressed optimism about a promotion plan that would help them compete with their arch enemies: walnuts and almonds. `` There have been no profits in the pecan industry in the last three or four years,'' said grower <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monticello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON>, one of about 20 speakers Thursday at the 24th annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pecan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said almond and walnut growers spend $ 15 million and $ 10 million, respectively, on promotion In contrast, previous efforts to unite the pecan industry have failed, so there has been no concerted effort to increase consumption. `` They're educating the consumer to eat walnuts and almonds, but people outside the pecan belt do n't know about the benefits of pecans,'' said <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pecan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>, a group that represents growers in all 16 pecan-producing states. Speakers at the meeting discussed marketing, economics, pest control and growing techniques. The 200 growers attending packed a conference hall in the morning when <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON> discussed the proposed federal marketing plan. Under the plan, growers would be assessed half a cent on each pound of pecans they sell. The assessment would generate $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million a year for research and advertising, he said. A bill establishing the marketing plan is scheduled to be introduced within a week by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. Wyche <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. A 15-member board would oversee the program. <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON> said growers will emphasize the nutritious qualities of pecans. `` Pecans are very healthy and nutritious,'' he said. `` They have no cholesterol. They're high in protein. I wish we could say they improve a person's sex life.'' <PERSON> Beshears </PERSON> said the per capita consumption of pecans has remained steady in recent years, while Americans ate more walnuts and almonds. From 1970 to 1987, pecan prices climbed 64 percent, while walnut and almond prices jumped 103 percent and 214 percent, respectively. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> is the nation's largest pecan producer. Other leading states are <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` We've been in a real cost squeeze,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, a horticulturist with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` All our costs are going up, and we're receiving less for the nuts. Walnut and almond growers are organized, and we're not.''

<TEXT>
 The architects of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark settlement of civil securities fraud charges will have to wait even longer for the agreement to be finalized That's because the judge who could approve the deal is blocked by court order from doing so and a panel of judges declined to assign the case to another judge Thursday. The assignment committee for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> held that `` no circumstance has arisen'' that would `` make it appropriate to reassign the case or any part of it to another judge.'' The settlement has been placed on hold for nearly a month because of a legal challenge to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who is assigned to the case. Former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who is not part of the settlement, is challenging <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s impartiality. The matter is before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A federal appeals court has issued a stay, preventing <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from taking any further action, including considering _ and possibly approving _ the settlement until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decides whether it will consider <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s appeal. Meanwhile, the appeals court's refusal to assign a different judge continues to delay the civil settlement as well as <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s record plea bargain to criminal charges Resolution of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact also is needed before <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> can formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $ 650 million to settle criminal charges brought by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` We're going to meet and decide what to do next,'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Solicitor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonson </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We're obviously very disappointed.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON>, said the investment banking giant also was disappointed. `` We believe it would be in everyone's best interest to have the settlement reviewed and approved.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> have twice asked the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider its stay to allow <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to handle the settlement or else assign the case to a different judge. But the appeals court said it did n't have authority. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> then tried to get the district court assignment committee to temporarilly assign the case to another judge to consider the settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it `` strongly believes it is in the public interest and important to the protection of investors'' to finalize the settlement `` as expedititously as possible.'' But the three-judge panel, headed by Chief Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brieant </PERSON>, also nixed the idea, saying it had n't been shown any evidence `` that such delay, which may result from awaiting action by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, will affect the public interest adversely.'' The panel also noted that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> `` has not requested of this committee that all or any part of this action be assigned to another judge, and gives us no present indication of intending to do so.'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> originally battled to get <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> to excuse himself from the case because his wife stands to make a hefty profit from a debt-financed acquisition <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> helped arrange. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> refused to step down from the case and the <ORGANIZATION> 2nd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, which delayed further district court proceedings pending its decision, upheld <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> in November. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> eventually dropped its objections to <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> but the delay was extended, when <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, who were both indicted for racketeering and securities law violations last month, sought to argue the issue before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld most of Proposition 103, a landmark law that places new controls on insurance companies, but insurance rates probably wo n't plummet soon. The surprising unanimous ruling Thursday has some important long-term consequences for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> insurance industry and its millions of customers, who now have laws to guard against geographic discrimination, policy non-renewals and uncontrolled rate increases. But for the short term, rates for car, property and liability insurance appear to be in the hands of the state's newly powerful insurance commissioner, <PERSON> Roxani </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, an appointee of Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, is, like many of her predecessors, a former insurance executive. Proposition 103 strengthens the office and seeks to sever its ties with the industry by making it an elective position, starting next year. Until then, <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> occupies a particularly sensitive post because of the court ruling. Proposition 103, approved by voters in November, was supposed to roll back insurance rates 20 percent below November 1987 levels and freeze them until this November, unless an insurer could show a `` substantial threat of insolvency.'' The prospects were for a relatively inflexible freeze, with few exceptions. But in the one important aspect of Thursday's ruling that favored insurers, the court said the `` threat of insolvency'' standard was too narrow and failed to guarantee a `` fair rate of return,'' the constitutional requirement established by the court in rent-control cases. Rejecting arguments that the freeze was justified as a temporary measure to compensate for uncontrolled rate increases, Justice <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> said, `` The asserted rise in insurance rates ... is a long-term, chronic situation which will not be solved by compelling insurers to sell at less than a fair return for a year.'' The court left the rollback in place, at least on paper, to take effect when the ruling becomes final in 30 days, barring an extension or appeal. But insurers will be allowed to apply to <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> for immediate exemptions, and to implement rate increases on their own while she considers the applications. Any amount that the commissioner considers `` excessive'' or `` unfairly discriminatory'' must be refunded, plus interest. In addition, starting this November, any proposed rate increase will have to be approved by <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> before taking effect, the first time the state has required advance approval of insurance rates. The measure also calls for a further 20 percent discount for `` good drivers,'' defined as those with no more than one moving violation in three years. It's `` reasonable to assume'' that many companies will seek exemptions from the 20 percent rollback, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Conneely </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s department, which is being expanded, currently lacks the staff, forms and office space to handle an expected flood of exemption requests. `` We will be there to monitor every action,'' promised Proposition 103 author <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfield </PERSON>. He said insurance companies should implement the rollback and refund any rates above that amount since last November. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s department also must decide when auto insurers may cancel or refuse to renew policies, under a section of the initiative that was upheld by the court. The provision allows non-renewal only in cases of fraud, non-payment or a `` substantial increase in the hazard insured against.'' No definition has been provided for a `` substantial increase,'' and insurers have already raised questions over whether it would cover, for example, the addition of a teen-age driver in a household. Insurers raised a constitutional challenge against the provision, saying it could not be applied to insurance policies that were issued before last November without violating contractual rights. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> disagreed. The infringement on contracts was `` relatively moderate,'' he said, and was outweighed by the public interest in keeping insurance available to all, particularly in light of fears that many insurers would refuse to renew policies if Proposition 103 passed. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> also noted that insurers still can withdraw from the state, with approval by <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s department. The commissioner has cited Proposition 103's non-renewal provisions in prohibiting several companies from pulling out of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> without arranging substitute coverage for their customers. Another important provision that will soon be before the department changes the rules for setting auto insurance rates. Insurance companies, citing differences in costs, traditionally have varied rates between geographic areas, prompting complaints by many city residents that insurance was unavailable or unaffordable. Proposition 103 requires rates to be based primarily on a driver's record, with geography considered only if the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> allows it

<TEXT>
 The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this morning, with trading made nervous by the prospect of central bank intervention later during the session. Gold prices fell. Supported by relatively high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, and expectations that interest rates may rise even further, the market was bidding the dollar up, traders said. International monetary authorities, on the other side, were ready to intervene and stop the dollar's advance, they said. One Italian trader said the central banks were likely to wait until after the release today of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment report for April. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was closed for Children's Day, a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 134.25 yen compared with 133.95 yen Thursday. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday: _ 1.8955 West German marks, up from 1.8915 _ 1.6910 Swiss francs, up from 1.6860 _ 6.3970 French francs, up from 6.3875 _ 2.1361 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1290 _ 1,384.50 Italian lire, up from 1,380.00 _ 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1841 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.6768, Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 376.80 a troy ounce, down from $ 378.25 bid late Thursday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> has won permission from its parent company to publish for another year or until the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decides the fate of a joint operating agreement with The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The arrangement announced Thursday calls on the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to make cuts so its losses are less than $ 23 million. The Free Press lost $ 22.7 million last year and Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he was confident the paper could hold that pace through cuts in color, news space, travel and streamlined business practices. `` Absolutely this is possible, or else it would be stupid,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We are confident we can achieve this goal.'' The board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> decided unanimously at a meeting Thursday morning in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to continue publication. When the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided Monday to hear a challenge of the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, with a decision expected next year, some analysts wondered if <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> would absorb the Free Press' losses for another year. The Free Press and The News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, have sought the partial merger since 1986. The papers aim to cut costs by combining advertising, circulation and production operations while keeping separate news and editorial departments. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> has n't released annual loss figures, but has said the News lost $ 64.95 million from 1980 through 1987. The Free Press also said it and the News will reopen contract negotiations at once with both newspapers' unions. More than 3,000 union employees have gone without contractual raises since 1986.

 A grass-roots housing group from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> joined to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> because the bank extended credit to a company the union is striking, a spokesman for the housing organization says. The UMW went on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last month. `` We're sort of joining hands with them in terms of trying to put pressure on an entity which, in one way or another, is supporting <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Now </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ACORN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> ACORN </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> filed papers with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday asking it to block Manufacturers's purchase of 11 branches of <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The groups claim Manufacturers broke the law by failing to make mortgage loans in predominantly black or Hispanic neighborhoods in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The Community Reinvestment Act requires that banks meet the credit needs of their entire communities, and not just higher-income neighborhoods in their service areas. Asked why <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about banking practices in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, where it has no members, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> said: `` ... the role that they're playing is to generally forsake low-income and poor people in the community for large companies for leveraged buyouts, for high-income neighborhoods, and we think there's something the matter with that.'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has been attempting to put pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> through several banks, including <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, that extended a $ 100 million line of credit to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has charged the credit line was <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s `` strike fund.'' About 1,500 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> had been working without a contract for 14 months when they went on strike April 5. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> announced the withdrawal of $ 30 million from <ORGANIZATION> Crestar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fianancial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the five banks extending the line of credit to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s international union withdrew $ 6.7 million from the bank, while the <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confectionery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s pension fund pulled out $ 23 million. `` Clearly, we started looking at Manufacturers Hanover when we saw what they were doing with their capital assets in terms of the loan to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Zinn </PERSON> said. `` Whether this puts pressure on them, I do n't know. That's for the bank to decide.'' MHT spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said his company has been found by federal and state banking regulators to be in compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. <PERSON> Stefans </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> official spoke at the bank's annual meeting April 21 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and asked the bank to withdraw its portion of the line of credit. The bank spokesman said he had not seen the ACORN-UMW papers and could not respond directly. But he said the bank had not made loans for one - to four-family houses until recently The union and <ORGANIZATION> ACORN </ORGANIZATION> charged in their papers that while 43 percent of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s population lives in predominantly white census tracts, `` <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanny </PERSON> has progressively made more of of its loans _ 67 percent in 1986, 68 percent in 1987 and 69 percent in 1988 _ in these tracts.'' They said that in census areas with more than 75 percent minority residents, `` where 57 percent of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s population lives, Manufacturers Hanover granted far fewer loans.''

 Five offers higher than <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 63 million agreement to buy <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> have been made to the casino's state-appointed conservator. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stupak </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel-Casino </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, offered $ 64 million on Thursday for the Atlantis, just above <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s signed agreement. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> intends to close the Atlantis casino and operate it as a hotel, but <PERSON> Stupak </PERSON> said he would keep the casino open. `` The senior citizens and disabled of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> will continue to benefit from the approximately $ 6 million in casino win taxes paid by the Atlantis, and I have every intention of retaining the Atlantis employees on their jobs,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, the conservator operating the Atlantis since its license expired April 14, said he is accepting purchase offers for the financially failing gaming hall. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> he questions the validity of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> because it may have been signed after he became conservator. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was not available for comment Thursday, said his secretary in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Foerderer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said he has already received four bids for the Atlantis, either in writing or by telephone, but refused to identify the interested parties or their bids. He said all the new bids would keep the Atlantis casino in tact. <PERSON> Stupak </PERSON> said he would keep the Atlantis' three-floor casino open even though it has not proven to be a financial success. <PERSON> Stupak </PERSON> has challenged <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> before.

 The stock market staged a broad rally today, inspired by new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.74 to 2,398.64 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 755 up, 184 down and 483 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 28.68 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the civilian unemployment rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in April, to 5.3 percent. The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates on Wall Street. The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in inflation.

<HEAD>Indian Tribes Mulling Bond Sales To Raise Cash; Japanese Intrigued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American Indian tribes are exploring major bond issues as a way to raise cash for tribal development projects, an idea boosted by a recent change in federal law and one that has piqued the interest of the Japanese. Late last month, <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of the Japanese investment house, gathered tribal leaders, government officials, Indian experts and others in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a daylong conference on tribal financing. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, said the meeting was designed to present financing opportunities to both the tribes and investors. `` It looks like a good opportunity for channeling some of the Japanese money coming into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> said. `` We're satisfied that the business is there. Now it's just a matter of can we put deals together.'' The effort is prompted by an amendment to the federal Indian Finance Act signed into law last September. The amendment allows tribes to float bonds that would be backed by government guarantees for up to 90 percent of their value. Such government backing would put tribal bonds on par with many bonds issued by government agencies. Government guarantees allow the bond issuer to pay a lower interest rate since the buyers are assured of getting most of their money back should there be a default. The lower interest rate makes the bonds cheaper for the tribes to issue. <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON> is working on a major Indian funding project that would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> said, though he declined to give details. In addition to bonds, funding mechanisms for tribal projects under exploration by <PERSON> Daiwa </PERSON> include joint ventures, equity interests and private placements, or debt issues that are sold privately and not publicly traded, <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> said. One bond issue the company is working on would provide about $ 6.5 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Chickasaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Arbuckle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION>, a 485-acre drive-through park and exotic wild animal preserve in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> that is a major tourist attraction. However, the government-guaranteed bond issue has been delayed by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve the financing. The <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, have not finished writing regulations to implement the amendment to the Indian Finance Act, said <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. `` No one knew at the time that amendment was passed that there would have to be new regulations written,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said last week. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> must receive funding for a reserve fund to guarantee the bond issues, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. A request for that funding was not submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year because `` we do n't feel like we can request those funds'' due to budgetary constraints, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. The soonest the reserve fund could be approved, allowing government-backed tribal bonds to be issued, would be fiscal 1991, which starts October 1, 1990, assuming <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves the funding by then, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> said he believes the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> is creating unnecessary delays. Nowhere in the amendment does it say that new regulations or a new reserve fund are needed, he said, pointing out that a reserve fund was created under the existing Indian Finance Act. `` The law was written to be enacted immediately,'' he said. Indian tribes can float bonds under the original Indian Finance Act, which was approved in the early 1980s, but the bonds are n't guaranteed by the government Instead, the tribes must back the issues by natural-resource earnings or other tribal revenue. The amended finance law provides enhanced capability for the tribes to raise money, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, an Indian attorney who is a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> dispute is overshadowed by the significance of the Indian gathering in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Leaders from 20-plus tribes came to Wall Street bringing their deals and saying ` Let's do business,''' he said. `` It was the first time in history. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is 100 percent behind the individual initiatives that are taking place in Indian country,'' he added. `` And the tribes themselves are emerging as very powerful business entities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> will fall in line.''

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary are facing a class-action suit by a couple who were aboard a plane on which nine passengers were sucked out a hole created when a cargo door broke off the aircraft. The suit alleges that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-100 jet, were negligent in operating and building the plane. It asked for compensatory damages of more than $ 1 million and punitive damages to be set by a jury. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimlich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Broadview </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, asked that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suit be made a class action on behalf of the 320 people who were aboard <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 on Feb. 24. The suit alleges that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> failed to properly maintain the aircraft and allowed it to become unsafe. It said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> knew, or should have known, about defects in the plane which might make it unsafe. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters, said, `` We have n't seen the suit and have no comment.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the aircraft manufacturer is not going to comment on matters that are under litigation. <PERSON> Zimlich </PERSON>, a semi-retired real estate executive, escaped injury as the plane turned around while en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with a front cargo door and part of its fuselage ripped off. The accident occurred while the plane was over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. His wife, a retired teacher, suffered an ear injury as the plane quickly depressurized and also suffered neck and back injuries during the emergency ramp evacuation of the plane, according to the couple's attorney, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebovitz </PERSON>. `` Emotionally, they're not doing too well,'' added <PERSON> Lebovitz </PERSON>, who said the couple have had trouble sleeping since the accident, which occurred as they began a vacation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> with Mrs. <PERSON> Zimlich </PERSON>'s sister. Several suits have been filed in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> by other survivors, according to <PERSON> Lebovitz </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Wall Street Sees No Severe Housing Slump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like a good many other American industries, housing and real estate have lately felt the pinch of high interest rates. But some Wall Street analysts maintain that the homebuilding business is going through nothing much worse than a moderate down cycle that wo n't have dire or far-reaching consequences for the economy. In fact, a few observers argue that stocks of homebuilding companies, which generally have turned in an uninspired showing over the past year or two, could soon start to revive if interest rates are ready to come down. Figures published by the <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> survey show that housing starts, the historical gauge of the homebuilding industry's health, have been declining steadily from a peak they reached more than three years ago In the first quarter of 1986, work was started on new private dwelling units at the rate of 1.94 million a year. In the second quarter of this year, by contrast, Value Line estimates the total will come in at an annual rate of 1.40 million. Still, the investment advisory firm says it believes housing starts will bottom out toward the end of this year not far below current levels. `` That would be the culmination of a historically mild decline that has developed gradually from the 1986 peak,'' says analyst <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>'s recently published quarterly appraisal of the industry outlook. `` Most of this decline has occurred in multi-family housing, due to previous overbuilding stimulated by tax laws that have since been changed. `` Single-family housing starts have a good shot at topping the 1 million level in 1989 for an unprecedented seventh consecutive year, after troughing at 660,000 in 1982.'' Even if housing is in for a more extended period of weakness than analysts now expect, some observers contend that it need not drag the rest of the economy down with it. In the past, weakness in housing traditionally ushered in recessions in the overall economy. When tight money sent home buying and homebuilding into a slump, demand dropped off for building materials, home furnishings, appliances _ and a ripple effect occurred. In the 1980s, however, past patterns have n't held, says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. While housing has been strong ever since the early 1980s, he notes, manufacturing is in the early stages of recovery from a severe mid -'80s `` Housing and factory activity are out of phase at present,'' <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> says, `` and that enhances the prospects for a slide in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> housing activity without an economy-wide downturn.'' <PERSON> Barbera </PERSON> acknowledges that it's always dangerous in financial or economic forecasting to adopt the premise that `` things are different this time than they were in previous cycles.'' But analysts say several things have indeed occurred lately to change the nature of the homebuilding business _ including the advent of the adjustable-rate mortgage and the growth of the mortgage-backed securities market, which channels additional money into real estate finance. Says Grant: `` We believe the housing cycle will go through narrower swings than in the past.''

<HEAD>City Pension Fund Threatens Exxon Board Members Over Valdez Oil Spill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The head of the city pension system says other stockholders should join him in voting against the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board unless the company gives assurances that it has taken steps to prevent another disaster like the Alaskan oil spill. City Finance Commissioner <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> and Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> on Thursday. <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said they wanted to ensure the safety of the city's $ 250 million investment in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock and expressed concern that such an environmentally devastating spill not happen again. <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> management `` listened to our concerns and asked for a couple of days'' in which to come back with a response. `` We told them that depending on your answers, we will vote against the board'' at the company's May 18 stockholders meeting, he said. Although the pension fund holds 6 million shares, or less than 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock, <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said, `` We would obviously be in contact with other pension systems throughout the country to see if we could get them to back us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> declined to comment on Thursday's meeting, saying that meetings with investors are private. <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> is chairman of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Employees Retirement System which, together with police, fire and teacher pension systems, controls about $ 20 billion in investments. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> commented later that the oil spill at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s slow response `` are two outrages that can not adequately be described in words.'' He said he supported <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON>' decision to `` use NYCERS' leverage to make <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> the environmentally sound corporate citizen it should have been long ago.'' <PERSON> Shorris </PERSON> said the city was willing to wait a `` couple of days'' to hear back from the oil company, but cautioned that `` time is short.'' He said the city wanted to know if any changes were contemplated in management structure of the firm, what kind of research and development programs it has to deal with oil spills of the Valdez magnitude and what contingency plans it has to deal with such mishaps. He said that while the city is concerned with the environment, the pension trustees also have `` a fiduciary obligation to the pensioneers to make sure their funds are safe.''

 Personal income is growing at an uneven pace in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cities, with the fastest growth along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and the slowest in oil-producing states, a government report shows. Twenty-three of the nation's 318 metropolitan areas in 1987 registered per capita income growth at least 2 percentage points above the national average of 6 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Seven of those cities were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; six were in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> region; five were in the Southeast. Income in 60 metropolitan areas, meanwhile, grew at a rate that was at least 2 percentage points below the national average. Forty-one of those areas were in the oil-producing states of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` A lot of growth in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is driven by services and high-tech industries,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Albetski </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> `` The slow growth was driven by the weakness in oil.'' The fastest growth rate was recorded in the <LOCATION> Visalia-Tulare-Porterville </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but that was largely because incomes there were relatively low to begin with. The area's per capita income rose 9.7 percent to $ 12,968, a level still well below the national average. At the other end of the scale, two regions registered declines in 1987: per capita income fell 1.4 percent in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to $ 14,723, and dropped 0.6 percent in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to $ 12,363. In a ranking of income levels, first place belonged to the <LOCATION> Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, with per capita income of $ 26,316. Bringing up the rear was the <LOCATION> McAllen-Edinburg-Mission </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at $ 7,001. The first - and last-place areas were the same as in 1986, but the gap between them grew as the 9.1 percent rate of per capita income growth in the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> area more than doubled the 4.2 percent pace in the <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> region The per capita income gap between the two regions was $ 19,315 in 1987, up from $ 17,412 a year earlier. For the nation as a whole, per capita income in 1987 was $ 15,484, up from $ 14,609 a year earlier. In addition to the <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> region, here are the other metropolitan areas in the top 10 for 1987 per capita personal income: <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, $ 24,593; Bergen-Passaic, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, $ 23,040; <LOCATION> Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, $ 22,783; <LOCATION> Nassau-Suffolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 22,001; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, $ 21,539; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, $ 21,510; <LOCATION> Anaheim-Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, $ 21,444; <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, $ 21,432, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach-Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton-Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, $ 21,246.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed this morning in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices were down following a week of steady advances. Analysts say there is some reluctance to buying into wheat futures at current price levels.

Corn and soybean futures were higher despite forecasts for more rain over the weekend. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent lower to 2 -LCB- cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.35 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with May at $ 2.77 -RCB- a bushel; oats were a -LCB- cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 1.91 \ a bushel; soybeans were a \ cent to 4 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.54 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Unemployment shot up 0.3 percentage points last month to 5.3 percent as job growth dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years, the government said today in a report confirming a slowdown in the economy. The April jobless rate was the highest since January and moved civilian unemployment off the more than 15-year low of 5.0 percent posted in March. The report inspired a broad rally of the stock market, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbing 17.59 points in the first 90 minutes of trading. Some analysts questioned whether the economy has slowed too much to orchestrate a `` soft landing'' without a recession. The early consensus was that a recession was not imminent, although many analysts held fast to predictions one would come late this year or next year. `` This is certainly consistent with a soft landing. This is not a sign of a recession in progress,'' said economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The White House played down the increase in unemployment, with spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noting that the percentage of working-age Americans who have jobs remains `` at an all-time high of 63.3 percent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s survey of business found the addition of 117,000 non-farm payroll jobs in April, the lowest number since the government reported a drop of 92,000 positions in June 1986. The department also revised March payroll growth to 171,000, down from 180,000, in yet another sign of a slowing economy. The slower job growth contrasts sharply with the average monthly payroll growth of 300,000 in the 12 months that ended in February. The number of unemployed workers also increased in April after two months of decline, rising about 420,000 to 6.5 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s separate household survey. The business survey found that the average work week in the non-farm private sector rose 0.4 hours to 35 hours, while the manufacturing work week grew by 0.3 hours to 41.3 hours. Manufacturing overtime edged up 0.1 hour to 4.0 hours. The department, however, said those figures may well be revised downward because the formula for seasonally adjusting the figures does not take into account that the Easter holiday fell in March this year instead of April. The department said the civilian labor force _ the pool of employable people _ grew by 395,000 in April, its largest monthly jump this year. That would be greeted as good news by financial analysts who have blamed rising wages on an unusually tight labor market. Underscoring market concerns about inflation, the report said average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April after climbing 0.3 percent for two months. However, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, commissioner of labor statistics, cautioned against reading the latest wage data as a major inflationary factor, saying wage growth `` seems to occur in fits and starts.'' At the same time, she acknowledged that the report was another piece in the mounting evidence of an economic slowdown. `` The slowdown in March and April is real,'' Ms. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said in prepared congressional testimony. `` While we are not getting net job losses, we are creating far fewer jobs than we were even a few months ago, and few industries are significantly expanding their employment.'' She said some slowdown has to be expected in the record seventh year of the economic expansion and the slower growth did not necessarily signal a downturn. The data make it increasingly unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will tighten credit again when its policymaking committee meets later this month. The central bank has been keeping the tight rein on credit to slow the economy to curb inflation, and recent reports have shown evidence of that slowdown. The 117,000 growth in non-farm payrolls was about have the number predicted by most analysts and occurred almost entirely in the service sector. Still, the growth even in that strong sector slowed somewhat, with wholesale trade posting only a modest gain in jobs while finance, insurance and real estate reported declines. Construction posted a modest gain of 6,000 jobs after two months of reporting declines. The increase in the civilian unemployment rate predominantly affected men. The jobless rate among white men rose from 3.6 percent in March to 4.0 percent last month, while among Hispanic men it shot up from 6.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Unemployment among black men rose from 9.8 percent to 10.0 percent. The unemployment rate among white women also rose, from 3.8 percent to 4.1 percent, while among black women it dropped from 9.1 percent to 8.8 percent. The government does not break down the Hispanic unemployment data by sexes. Among black teen-agers, the demographic group with by far the highest jobless rate, unemployment dipped from 34.8 percent to 26.2 percent in April. In a separate caculation of unemployment including military personnel based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the jobless rate also rose by 0.3 percentage points, from 4.9 percent to 5.2 percent.

 Share prices closed higher on Friday, encouraged by renewed institutional buying on the first day of a new trading period and some bullish signals from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figures for April. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 13.8 points, or 0.7 percent higher, at 2,132.8. It was the highest closing level since the October 1987 stock market crash, topping the previous closing high of 2,125.4 set on March 14. News that the unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent in April suggested the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> economy was cooling and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would n't have to be raised again, dealers said. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> share prices gained more support later in the trading session with the start of a new two-week trading account, dealers added. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> divides trading into two-week and three-week trading periods for accounting purposes. Volume was a moderate 589.2 million shares, up from 541.7 million shares Thursday.

 The stock market put together a spirited rally today, inspired by new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.37 to 2,409.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 989 up, 384 down and 514 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the civilian unemployment rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in April, to 5.3 percent. The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates on Wall Street. The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in inflation. Nevertheless, the news sparked a rally in the bond market, sending interest rates lower, and stocks followed suit. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 -RCB- at 129; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 111; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 42 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 43 |, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 34 The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.27 to 173.48.

<HEAD>Dollar Up in Europe Despite Intervention; Gold Off</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar ended mostly higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Friday, reovering from a selloff on news of a rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate and defying a concerted effort by central banks to stem its advance. Gold prices moved lower. The dollar dropped sharply after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a jump in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate to 5.3 percent in April from 5 percent in March. The increase was consistent with recent statistics showing slower economic activity. Some analysts say slower growth will induce the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a more generous credit policy. Interest rates have headed up this year because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank has been trying to stifle inflationary pressures by putting the brakes on economic growth. High <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates have boosted demand for dollars and dollar-denominated investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and several European central banks pounced on the dollar when it reached the 1.89-level to the West German mark, dealers said But they said the intervention was moderate and that the underlying demand for dollars remained strong. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6740 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6841 Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Thursday included: 1.8988 West German marks, up from 1.8915; 1.6985 Swiss francs, up from 1.6860; 6.4080 French francs, up from 6.3875; 2.1285 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1290; 1,379.00 Italian lire, down from 1,380.00; and, 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1841. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was closed for Children's Day, a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 134.31 yen compared with 133.95 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Thursday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 376.25 a troy ounce from $ 378.25 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to close at a bid of $ 375.85 compared with $ 379 bid late Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 75 cents to close at $ 378.41. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.60 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 5.66.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Friday in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as expectations of additional export of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains spurred the market. Wheat futures continue to show strength as a result of the offer this week by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to sell 1.5 million metric tons of grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the export subsidy program. `` I think even if they are not bidding now, they will be in the market in the near future,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That is keeping wheat prices firm.'' A day after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> made the offer, the Soviets announced a bid for 300,000 metric tons of wheat. Wheat prices were also helped along by the poor condition of the winter crop in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, caused by dry weather and heat. Expected Soviet demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn also spurred prices for that commodity. `` The Soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past,'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. `` The market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be done.'' Soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Brazilian cash soybean markets. At the close, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 \ cents higher with May at $ 4.37 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 5 cents higher with May at $ 2.80 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 6 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.97 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 10 cents higher with May at $ 7.60 a

<HEAD>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Loses $116 Million in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said its loss widened to $ 116.1 million in the first quarter from a loss of $ 35.3 million for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose to $ 315.5 million from $ 276.7 million a year earlier. Losses increased largely because of rising interest rates on company debt and higher market costs for new products in the school publishing division. The losses were offset by better performances in <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s amusement park and insurance businesses, according to the company's earnings statement. Because much of the company's business is seasonal, first-quarter results are n't necessarily indicative of the entire year, the company said.

<HEAD>LA Daily Management Discusses Buyout from Hearst</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> are exploring the possibility of a management-led buyout of the paper from <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by a group that would include employees. The discussions are in a very preliminary stage, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s chief operating executive. `` I think it's a long shot,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said. `` We have to develop a strategic plan and ascertain if there would be equity funding available.'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> announced his plans to a group of the paper's editors Wednesday. He said the proposal would be based on converting the 242,000-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> daily to a tabloid format. The possibility of such a conversion has been under study at the paper for several years. Earlier this year representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> about a possible joint venture involving the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. But the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON>, said that because of the Sun's heavy commitments to a new daily newspaper in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and its simultaneous start-up of a daily financial newspaper in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, his company had decided not to proceed. In April, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> approached <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> about possibly buying the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who recently launched a $ 2.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, decided against the move. Heart plans `` to continue exploring different options,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said. `` Obviously -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decided some months ago they were interested in looking for a buyer.'' Privately held <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged financial losses at the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> but does not disclose specific figures for the newspaper. In 1967, when nine unions embarked on a long strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> had a daily circulation of 729,000, making it the nation's largest afternoon daily.

<HEAD>Hughes Accused Of Overcharging Federal Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high-level manager at <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has accused the firm in a federal lawsuit of overcharging the government by $ 40 million on the radar system for the F-18 fighter jet and B-2 stealth bomber. The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last January and unsealed late last month, alleges that top officers at <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> conspired to defraud the government by shifting development charges among programs. <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday in a statement that its own investigation found that all the charges made to the government were proper. Filed under the Federal False Claims Act, the suit seeks $ 120 million in triple damages. The act allows a plaintiff to bring lawsuits on behalf of the government and share in the recovery of damages. The suit refers to a special program contract instead of specifically identifying the B-2 program, but unidentified sources told the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times that the project involved is the stealth bomber. The suit was brought by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, who was division contracts manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> is still employed by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, but in a different division.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> negotiators Friday approved a tentative contract agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that restores wage cuts workers made nearly seven years ago to help the company avoid financial disaster. If ratified by the 20,500 <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members on the job at the nation's second-largest steelmaker, the agreement would be the first among four major producers whose contracts expire July 31 The 50-month agreement would immediately boost the average hourly wage from $ 11.23 to $ 12.22, restoring an 8 percent cut granted by the union in August 1982. It also restores three paid holidays and cost of living bonuses. It improves pensions and insurance benefits and awards each worker a $ 500 signing bonus and a $ 500 advance on this year's profit-sharing payments The offer goes next to the union's international executive board and then to a vote by the rank-and-file. The negotiating committee voted 18-7 in favor. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s major plants are at Sparrows Point, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Burns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` This is an agreement that puts the past behind us and ... all the difficult times of the 1980s,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` The settlement recognizes that sacrifices were made by <ORGANIZATION> USWA </ORGANIZATION> members in the past two contracts and also that <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> is still a company in transition that must continue to carefully control its costs,'' said <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> Senior Vice President <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON>, also the company's chief negotiator. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> lost more than $ 2 billion from 1982 to 1986. Last year it had profits of $ 403 million, and in the first quarter this year $ 65 million. The workers are expected to approve the contract because of the money it offers, but <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the centerpiece of the agreement is a career development program. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> will pay $ 300,000 per month for worker training, education and personal development. The program will also receive the $ 5 per hour <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> agreed to pay for each hour of overtime worked beyond 56 hours per week. The penalty climbs to $ 7.50 per hour in 1991 and $ 10 per hour in 1992. The penalty reflects the union's distaste for heavy overtime duty for some of its members while others have faded into retirement, lower-paying jobs or unemployment due to the industry's massive cutbacks since 1982 <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the career development program address the union's desire to help workers enhance their skills and with them their job security `` We've been itching to get at the problem in a more substantial way,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We've created an opportunity to make a more substantial contribution to our members.''

 Civilian unemployment, rising at the fastest clip in more than three years, jumped to 5.3 percent last month, the government said Friday in a report that was taken as the strongest evidence yet of an economic slowdown. Propelling the 0.3 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was the smallest rise in new jobs since June 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Economists and financial markets, concerned for months that the persistently heady economy was moving into a period of spiraling price hikes, found both good and bad news in Friday's report. The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 24 points at mid-afternoon, closed down 2.94 points. Brokers said some investors were apparently worried about what a slowing economy might mean for corporate profits. Indeed, some analysts even wondered whether the dramatic increase in joblessness was signalling that the danger now is one not of inflation but of recession. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> played down the significance of the first rise in unemployment of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brief tenure as president, noting that the percentage of working-age Americans with jobs `` remains at an all-time high of 63.3 percent. Other economists welcomed from Friday's news. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> said the data was `` about perfect'' for prospects of generating a soft landing for the soaring economy _ slowing growth just enough to rein in inflation without triggering a recession. `` There's no question the economy is weakening,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` But there's nothing in this report to suggest we are heading into a recession.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was more cautious He predicted a mild recession later this year and said the economy was `` downshifting to slower growth. This is part and parcel of the bloom being off the rose of what has been a booming economy.'' Economists concurred that Friday's surprising jump in the unemployment rate will likely be enough to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from further tightening credit when it next reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks. April's 5.3 percent civilian unemployment rate _ up from a 15-year low of 5.0 percent a month earlier and the biggest one-month gain since February 1986 _ was felt most heavily by men. The jobless rate among white men rose from 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent; for Hispanic men, from 6.5 percent to 8.3 percent; for black men, from 9.8 percent to 10.0 percent. The commissioner of labor statistics, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, who rarely speculates on the health of the economy, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` The slowdown in employment in March and April is real.'' While economists have said rising unemployment is a necessary ingredient to cooling off inflation, Friday's report provided no immediate evidence of that cause-and-effect relationship. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, based on a monthly sampling of the nation's households, showed that inflation, if not picking up steam, was at least persisting. Average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April after climbing 0.3 percent each of the prior two months. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said the wage gains were an indication of a coming period of `` stagflation'' _ inflation despite slow economic growth. But <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was skeptical. `` I tend to disbelieve that number, but it's certainly a number to watch,'' he said. `` That's a very big number.'' As for job growth last month, a separate department survey of businesses found that only 117,000 non-farm payroll jobs were created. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised payroll growth for March downward from 180,000 to 171,000. Over the 12-month period that ended in February, an average of 300,000 jobs had been created each month. Despite the overwhelming evidence of slower growth, the department said that the average non-farm work week rose 0.4 hour to 35 hours and that the manufacturing work week grew by 0.3 hour to 41.3 hours. Department analysts, offering an explanation for those figures, said the department's seasonal adjustment formula _ used to remove periodic, predictable effects from the unemployment calculation _ assumes that Easter falls in April. The holiday was celebrated in March this year. Analysts said that quirk also was a likely factor in a reported April increase of only 5,000 jobs in retail trade, which had been posting average monthly gains of about 60,000. Growth in the overall service sector was somewhat slower as well, although service industries continued to provide the overwhelming bulk of payroll growth _ 112,000 of the new positions. That sector had averaged 258,000 new positions over the prior three months. The net gain of 5,000 payroll positions in goods-producing industries included a modest 6,000 increase in construction employment after two months of declines and the second consecutive monthly gain in mining employment. Partially offsetting those gains was a drop of 9,000 in manufacturing employment. At the same time, weekly manufacturing overtime edged up 0.1 hour to an even four hours, a sure sign to analysts that managers see even slower growth ahead and have decided to pay more overtime in lieu of hiring additional workers. `` Manufacturers and other employers have decided that life may be a little bit tough in the third and fourth quarters and they do n't want to increase their fixed costs by adding to payrolls,'' said <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these other unemployment statistics: Joblessness among white women rose from 3.8 percent to 4.1 percent, but dropped for black women from 9.1 percent to 8.8 percent. Among black teen-agers, unemployment dipped from 34.8 percent to 26.2 percent. In a calculation of unemployment including military personnel based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the department said joblessness also rose by 0.3 percentage points, from 4.9 percent to 5.2 percent.

<HEAD>Ads Pulled From CBS Stations in Support of Apple Industry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a show of solidarity with troubled apple growers, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday decided to pull $ 71,000 worth of television advertising for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> cherries from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The action is a protest against the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television show `` 60 Minutes,'' which apple growers feel damaged their industry with a recent report on the chemical Alar. The move came as apple sales continued to rebound, climbing 9 percent in the past week, according to the latest industry report, released Friday. `` Our association wanted to voice its displeasure over the way the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> broadcast of the ` 60 Minutes' program chose to sensationalize the Alar story,'' commission spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> said. The television ads were part of a $ 900,000 promotion of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> cherries the directors of the marketing and promotion group approved Thursday. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunett </PERSON>, a `` 60 Minutes'' spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined comment on the action because it does not directly involve the network. Alar is not used on cherries, but many of group's members grow both crops and `` we're trying to take a united stance on this issue,'' <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> had been targeted for extensive television advertising because sales of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> cherries in those areas are below the national average, <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> said. The $ 71,300 budgeted for advertising buys on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliates in those three cities will instead be spent on advertising on other television stations there, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Evans-Kraft </ORGANIZATION> advertising agency in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which handles the commission's accounts On Feb. 26, `` 60 Minutes'' ran an exclusive account of a <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report on pesticides in children's food. The study concluded that eating apples treated with Alar increased cancer risks in children. The report findings have been disputed by the apple industry and federal regulators have declared apples safe to eat. But the <ORGANIZATION> NRDC </ORGANIZATION> report sent apple sales into a tailspin, and growers contend they have lost millions of dollars as a result. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> grows half the nation's apples, and nearly all the domestic production this late in the season. The industry still has 16.8 million 42-pound boxes in storage that must be sold before the next harvest in the fall. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has said it plans to ban Alar next year, based on preliminary studies, but the chemical is still legal to use.

 The stock market finished mixed Friday, giving up a strong early gain in an erratic response to new evidence of slowing economic growth. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 20 points in early trading, closed with a 2.94 loss at 2,381.96. That left the average with a loss of 36.84 points for the week. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 820 up, 603 down and 539 unchanged.

The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday morning that the civilian unemployment rate took an unexpected 0.3 percentage point jump in April, to 5.3 percent. The monthly data also showed an increase of 117,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, substantially less than most advance estimates on Wall Street. The figures reinforced the spreading belief on Wall Street that the economy has been slowing in recent months, responding to credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. What remains less clear, analysts said, is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is starting to see any results in its primary mission of reining in inflation.

 The dollar spurted higher in worldwide trading Friday despite waves of concerted central bank intervention and the government's report of higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment during April. `` The dollar still seems to be king,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Early in the session, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report indicating the jobless rate had climbed to 5.3 percent in April from 5.0 percent the previous month. But the currency's recovery was quick and dramatic. As the currency pushed against the level of 1.90 West German marks, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, joined by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and other European central banks, began the first in a series of rounds of dollar-selling. Traders noted that the intervention, though frequent, was moderate in volume. They interpreted that as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> only intended to slow the dollar's rise, rather than completly curtail it. `` Consistently strong buying took the dollar back through the intervention levels,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McGroarty </PERSON> senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` What the day showed is that there is a consistent strong demand for dollars for investment in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, be it in the stock or bond market,'' he said. While the unemployment report was consistent with recent statistics showing slower economic activity, observers note that interest rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> do not appear to be easing. High <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates have boosted demand for dollars and dollar-denominated investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would like to keep the dollar from rising too far _ which would make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods more expensive overseas _ in order to help ease the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` As long as the dollar still is a high-yielding currency, you're going to see it maintain pretty good strength,'' <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said, adding that only a severe economic slowdown or a swelling trade deficit are likely to stifle demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market was closed for Children's Day, a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 134.31 yen, compared with 133.95 yen late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 134.25 yen from 134.20 yen Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound dipped to $ 1.6740 from $ 1.6841 Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sterling fell to $ 1.6755 from Thursday's $ 1.6813 Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Thursday, included: 1.8977 West German marks, up from 1.8958; 1.6963 Swiss francs, up from 1.6911; 6.4020 French francs, up from 6.4005; 1,384.63 Italian lire, up from 1,380.00; and 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1831. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Thursday, included: 1.8988 West German marks, up from 1.8915; 1.6985 Swiss francs, up from 1.6860; 6.4080 French francs, up from 6.3875; 2.1285 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1290; 1,379.00 Italian lire, down from 1,380.00; and 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1841. Gold prices were little changed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after falling overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $ 377.00 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 30 cents from Thursday's late bid. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery settled at $ 377.70 a troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 376.25 a troy ounce from $ 378.25 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to close at a bid of $ 375.85 from $ 379 bid late Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 75 cents to close at $ 378.41. Silver bullion for current delivery closed on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex at $ 5.598 a troy ounce, down from Thursday's settlement of $ 5.613. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver was trading at a late bid of $ 5.60 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 5.66.

<UNK>Pittston Announces First Dividends In Six Years</UNK>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced its first dividends in six years Friday, but a spokesman said the decision was n't a response to striking coal miners who have recently raised doubts about the company's finances. `` This had been talked about in the annual report and talked about by analysts,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` People can read into these things what they want.'' Members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> had questioned the company's failure to pay dividends since 1983 as part of a union strategy to take its disputes with the company directly to shareholders The union also has three proposals on the company's proxy ballot that will be voted during <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting Wednesday. Officials at the union headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, were n't available Friday for comment on the payment of dividends, according to a secretary reached by telephone <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, meeting in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, agreed to pay a 5-cent dividend on each share on June 1 to all stockholders of record as of May 16. Rumors about the dividend had caused a 50-cent rise in the company's stock Thursday, to $ 19.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to announcing the dividend, the company's directors approved a plan that will allow the company to repurchase up to 3 million of its common shares. Since July 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has bought 5.2 million of its shares at a cost of $ 66.5 million, or about $ 12.65 a share. The company will purchase the shares from time to time as conditions warrant, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. `` It's the kind of program that Wall Street expects you to do. We believe our stock is undervalued,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said. About 1,500 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> went on strike against the company on April 5 in a dispute over wages and benefits. Two hundred other miners at the company's operations in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> have remained on the job. Representatives of the miners' union have formed the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 1,721 of the company's 37.8 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is a diversified company with interests in coal mining, home security, security transportation services and air freight services.

<HEAD>Rise in Jobless Rate Drops Precious Metal Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Precious metal futures prices dropped Friday in dull trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of news that the nation's unemployment rate shot up 0.3 percent to 5.3 percent in April. On other markets, grain and soybean prices were up, livestock and meat prices were mixed, and oil prices were down. Gold settled $ 1.20 to 30 cents lower with the contract for delivery in June at $ 379.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.5 cents to 3.9 cents lower with May at $ 5.598 a troy ounce. `` There was more weakness in the economy than expected,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Initial selling was on the belief that the unemployment news would temper a surge in inflation.'' Inflation increases the desirability of investment in gold and silver. <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> also attributed the selloff to the strong dollar. Gold futures were able to recover most of their losses in late trading as investors began to believe the market was oversold. Silver, which was trading within a 6-cent range, was also able to attract some support late. `` Metals have been hit by lack of participation,'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said, adding that with the bad market and adequate supplies, there is not a rush to buy. Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as expectations of additional export of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains spurred the market. Earlier this week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offered to sell 1.5 million metric tons of grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the export subsidy program. The Soviets have announced a bid for 300,000 metric tons of wheat, leaving about 1.2 million metric tons available to them. `` I think even if they are not bidding now, they will be in the market in the near future,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` That is keeping wheat prices firm.'' Expected Soviet demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn also spurred prices for that commodity. `` The Soviets have made sporadic buys of corn in the past,'' <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. `` The market is waiting to hear how much more buying will be done.'' Soybean futures rose on word of tightness in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Brazilian cash soybean markets. Wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with May at $ 4.37 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents higher with May at $ 2.80 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 6 \ cents higher with May at $ 1.96 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 9 -LCB- cents higher with May at $ 7.59 -LCB- a bushel Energy futures declined in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on expectations of a surplus of gasoline. `` Crude oil took a beating because of the weakness in gasoline,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, an analyst with E.D. & amp; <ORGANIZATION> F </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 21 cents to 56 cents lower with June at $ 20.02 cents a barrel; heating oil was .95 cent to 7.74 cents lower with June at 40.85 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .55 cent to 2.12 cents lower with June at 67.50 cents a gallon. Live cattle prices were mixed and pork futures slightly higher in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The drop in cattle futures were limited by expected stronger cash prices in coming weeks and strong boxed meat purchases by retailers, said analyst <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s state employee pension fund, the nation's biggest, said Friday it might back an attempt by other major <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to pressure the company to better prepare for future environmental disasters in the wake of its Alaskan oil spill. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 8 million shares amounting to about 0.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding common stock, said the fund may back <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s plan to use its holdings in an effort to advocate the company change its spill strategies. `` We are looking very closely at what <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is doing,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, deputy comptroller for the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` ... If they are able to reach an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> that would address our concerns we would endorse that.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officials said Thursday after meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives that three city pension funds owning 6 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock would vote against company management at the May 18 annual meeting of shareholders if <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> failed to act on the group's recommendations. Among other requests, the group is asking for the formation of a subcommittee of the board to handle environmental matters as well as for a new contingency plan to deal with future disasters. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials and environmentalists have criticized <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for what they consider its slow response to the March 24 spill, which has fouled hundreds of miles of waters and coastline. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s employee, firefighter and police funds together own <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock amounting to less than 1 percent of the company's 1.33 billion outstanding common shares About 35 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s shares are owned by institutional investors. The company has some 713,000 shareholders. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said all pension funds with large holdings of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> stock are worried that the spill would have financial consequences for the company. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investors are particularly concerned about the `` inadequate state of preparedness'' by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` We're concerned about its management. Management has made statements in the past, representations that they are capable of handling oil spills,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. `` It appears that they were in fact not prepared and that their representations are not accurate.'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said that if <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> decides to take a position for or against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> management, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State Teachers Retirement Fund, which holds 5.5 million <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> shares, also would be included. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> comptroller <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is the trustee for both funds, owning 13.5 million Exxon shares, or about 1.01 percent of the outstanding common. Separately, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Employee Retirement Fund indicated it was considering its own course of action. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pandick </PERSON>, director of investor affairs for the state, said the pension fund does not normally send an official representative to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> annual meetings but would do so this year. A spokesman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> has been talking with the executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 65 large pension funds with $ 300 billion in assets. `` We have indications of interest of 22 million shares from other pension funds,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy counsel for the comptroller. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said all of the pension funds are members of the Council. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pension fund officials said earlier this week they would withhold votes on their 650,600 shares at this year's meeting as a symbolic gesture to underscore the state's concern about the spill.

 Oil futures prices declined in light trading Friday on a wave of profit-taking after gains earlier in the week. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed at $ 20.02 a barrel, 56 cents lower than Thursday's session. The contract traded as low as $ 19.99 but rose shortly before the close, traders said. Other crude contracts also closed the day lower. Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for June delivery fell 2.12 cents to 67.50 cents a gallon, while June heating oil declined 1.22 cents to settle at 47.37 cents a gallon. All other contract months were down, but less sharply. Prices surged late Wednesday and Thursday after an announcement that repairs on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil platform would take longer than expected. Brent crude production may be disrupted until the end of May, officials said. Friday's decline reflected concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> has increased production and might boost its quota in the second half of the year, traders said.

<HEAD>Mamma Mia! Learning Italian Not Easy For Armstrong Execs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A year after <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was acquired by the Italian tiremaker <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION>, several dozen employees of the new <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are going the extra mile and studying the mother tongue of their mother company. Treading where they have n't been in years _ the classroom _ the new Italian language students range from vice presidents to engineers. Some of the employees are spending extra time at work to take classes being offered in the cafeteria of the company's headquarters Others, including some vice presidents, are being trained by tutors who come to their offices or are taking college courses. In the hallways of the company's headquarters, and out on the building's grounds, it is not uncommon to hear employees practicing their new language skills. <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> officials say it was their idea to start the program, and that participation in the crash-language courses has been strictly voluntary. `` It's our way of saying we like being part of the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> organization,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Colella </PERSON>, employee relations manager at <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was our idea. They -LRB- executives in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> -RRB- said slow down, you do n't have to learn so fast,'' she said. While most of the people from the <ORGANIZATION> Pirelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, speak English, not all do so well, `` so it is helpful if we can meet each other halfway sometimes,'' <PERSON> Collella </PERSON> said. About 15 employees have finished a beginner's class and have moved on to the next level of instruction. Meanwhile, a second beginner's class has also started. The classes are held two days a week, from 4 to 6 p.m., so that the employees are taught partly on their own time and partly on the company's. The work day ends at 5 p.m. <PERSON> Collella </PERSON> said her office drew up a list of employees, from the 300 who work at the headquarters, who might find knowledge of Italian useful either because of contacts they will be making with Italians or because of materials they must read. When the employees were approached about taking lessons, `` we did n't have anyone say ` No,'' she said. `` We got a very positive response.'' At least seven management-level employees are learning Italian through the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> method, including <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who is a vice president and corporate counsel. `` It's tough to go back to school after all these years,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, who is 37. It's even tougher, he said, to find the time for visits by a tutor and for studying. `` I'm not entirely satisfied with my progress at this point,'' he said. `` I can read it better than I can speak it.'' A tutor has visited <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>'s office at least a couple dozen times, but some weeks he has had to skip lessons, he said. He also has instructional tapes to play in his car, but he said, `` I ca n't say I've listened to them as religiously as I should. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said there has been absolutely no attempt by executives in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> to pressure their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> employees into learning Italian. `` The opposite happened,'' he said. `` When I was over there, they said, ` Why are you learning it?''' `` They seemed to be pleased by it,'' he said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said he has found even his beginner's knowledge of Italian very useful on visiting <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, and that he would like to attain a reasonable degree of fluency `` so I can communicate in a basic business conversation.'' `` It's fun. It's different,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Prices Spurt on Unemployment Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices closed moderately higher Friday after an unexpectedly weak employment report gave investors hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might loosen the reins on interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond rose -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite direction from price, fell to 8.95 percent from 8.99 percent late Thursday. Bonds rallied after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported non-farm business payrolls expanded by only 117,000 jobs in April, the weakest showing since a drop of 92,000 jobs in June 1986. The department also reported that last month's unemployment rate rose to 5.3 percent from 5 percent in March and reached its highest level since January. <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the increase was smaller than expected and fueled the market's hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would relax credit in response to an apparent cooling of the economy. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eases credit, interest rates would likely fall while bond prices would rise. The employment report said hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April after climbing 0.3 percent a month for two months, but Held said the rise, which could have ignited fears of higher inflation and a resulting tightening of credit, was not enough to offset the non-farm payroll drop. However, <PERSON> Held </PERSON> said, trading was restrained in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly refunding auction, scheduled for next week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term governments rose 7-32 point to 5-16 point, intermediate maturities were up about -RRB- point and long-term issues were 7-16 point higher, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, jumped up by 4.67 to 1,137.47. In corporate trading, industrials also gained. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 1.72 to 306.20 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell to 8.73 percent as the discount slid 9 basis points to 8.44 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.87 percent as the discount declined 9 basis points to 8.39 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.96 percent as the discount went down 14 basis points to 8.29 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 913-16, compared to 9 ~ percent late Thursday

<HEAD>Signs of Slower Economic Growth Spark Erratic Market Reactions</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A jump in April's unemployment rate and weaker job creation implied economic growth has slowed, but the government report Friday provoked inconsistent reactions from financial markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the civilian unemployment rate climbed to 5.3 percent from 5 percent in March. As for job growth last month, a survey of businesses found only 117,000 non-farm payroll positions were created, the smallest monthly addition in 3 years. Economists said the unexpectedly weak employment news offered the most convincing evidence yet of slower activity and said this may keep the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from tightening credit any further when it reevaluates monetary policy in two weeks. Some analysts said the central bank might even decide to become more generous with credit, causing interest rates to decline. At first, Wall Street greeted the report with an enthusiastic rally, pushing the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials more than 20 points higher. After awhile, though, investors started worrying that a significant reduction in business activity could squeeze corporate profits. Plus, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might not have the leeway to loosen its credit clamp because inflationary pressures do n't seem to have abated much. These worries and sales to collect profits left the Dow Jones average with a loss on the day of 2.94 at 2,381.96. For the week, the key market measure shed 36.84 points. Overall, stocks had a mixed day. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 820 up, 603 down and 539 unchanged. Meanwhile, the dollar continued to flex its muscle, ignoring the economic evidence and defying concerted attempts by central banks to check its advance. Usually, weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic statistics tend to depress the dollar's value against other major currencies. Foreign exchange dealers said as the currency pushed against the level of 1.90 West German marks, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, joined by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and other European central banks, began the first in a series of dollar sales The intervention, though frequent, was moderate in volume. Dealers interpreted that as a sign the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> only intended to slow the dollar's rise, rather than completely curtail it. At the end of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8977 West German marks, up from 1.8958 on Thursday. In the credit markets, bond prices closed moderately higher, relinquishing the earlier gains that came soon after the unemployment report was issued. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond rose -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in an opposite direction from price, fell to 8.95 percent from 8.99 percent late Thursday.

 Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has signaled his interest in buying strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport hub, an <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> associate said late Friday. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> filed documents with the federal bankruptcy court Friday expressing his interest in the hub without specifying the price he'd be willing to pay, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> General Counsel <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who publicly expressed interest in all of Eastern some time ago but has n't formally bidded, is the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> filed a challenge to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed purchase of eight Eastern gates at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport, saying the transaction could lead to higher ticket prices in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The sale, worth about $ 85 million to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, would give <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> 23 of the 49 gates at the airport. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> only has four gates there currently, <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also filed Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for permission to sell $ 300 million in 5-year notes, with the proceeds to be used for working capital and possible acquisitions. <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> said the notes are n't specifically intended to raise money to buy Eastern. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said former airline executive <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who is spearheading a group interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, has met with officials of the ailing carrier. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who has joined with investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in formulating a possible bid for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, met Thursday with executives of the airline at its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. He declined to disclose details or identify the Eastern officialsinvolved. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> is a former senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and was chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> until it was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. The Howard group also met recently with officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and the committee representing its major creditors. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> by phone in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and at his home Friday were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> reiterated the company's position that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was not for sale and was proceeding with its recently announced plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise some $ 1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets. `` We're committed to the rebuilding plan as the most sensible course,'' he said. The Eastern officials gave <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> information as requested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. At a hearing on Wednesday, the judge requested that the Howard group be given confidential financial data on Eastern which is to be provided to all serious bidders for the airline. Billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>, who formally submitted an offer for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> last week, already has received the information. So has <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, according to his general counsel. `` We're going to have a lot of people reading a lot of pieces of paper over the weekend,'' <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> said. Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union that was supported by pilots and flight attendants, virtually grounding the airline. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has set next Wednesday as a deadline for all interested bidders to submit their offers to the court, which must approve any sales of Eastern assets. A source close to the situation said the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> group would have a formal offer ready by the May 10 deadline. Attorney <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>, has declined to give specifics of the proposal but said it would include <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle service, slated to be sold to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, an aggressive regional carrier, on Wednesday offered $ 726 million for the shuttle routes and landing slots, along with 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 jetliners. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has set a hearing for next Friday over the Trump shuttle deal. As part of its offer, the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> plans to propose a bankruptcy reorganization plan for Eastern, <PERSON> Kaden </PERSON> said. He did not return phone calls seeking comment on the meeting with Eastern officials.

Despite the disagreement, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said they were willing to accept Chris-Craft's interpretation `` in order to put this issue behind us once and for all.'' The two companies asked the court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ where all three companies are incorporated _ to issue a declaration that would determine the rights of the parties and allow the merger to proceed. `` Our complaint seeks to compel Chris-Craft and <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> to choose an arrangement as dictated by the terms of the existing agreement and to avoid any effort by Chris-Craft to delay or otherwise interfere with the merger,'' Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Chris-Craft became <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest stockholder in 1984 after helping <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> fight an unwanted takeover bid from publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> have been at loggerheads ever since, quarreling over a number of issues. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> did not comment publicly after <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to form <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest media concern. The combined stock market value of the two companies at the time of the announcement was about $ 15 billion. Media industry analysts had expected the <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> chairman to raise some objection to the proposed merger. Chris-Craft did not immediately return a reporter's phone call seeking comment on the statements by Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Machinists union at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has told the carrier's parent it plans to mount its own bid to buy the airline holding company, union sources said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union, made the proposal in a letter to the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the target of several suitors, including two to four that <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said last week are friendly. Billionaire oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has made the only formal bid, a $ 2.7 billion, $ 90-a-share offer that he this week switched from a hostile to a friendly effort. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> said it filed an amended document Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, stating that it plans to provide additional confidential information and access to an unspecified number of interested parties. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> also said it plans on May 12 to distribute certificates representing preferred stock purchase rights under the corporation's `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan to holders of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> common stock as of the close of business May 4. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, confirmed receipt of the letter but said he had n't seen it and could n't describe its contents. `` We're going to study the letter before we have a response to it,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. `` We have n't digested all the things in it.'' The letter said the union was `` determined to explore initiation of our own program as an alternative'' to other bids for <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents about 21,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and other employees at Northwest. The letter said the union's proposal is at a preliminary stage. However, it outlined several elements likely to be included in its bid: _ It would avoid the heavy debt burden typical of leveraged buyouts _ It would reduce labor costs while increasing <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s business and still not `` adversely affect the compensation'' of individual employees _ It would involve a substantial employee stake in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> _ It would put a block of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock in the hands of a `` patient investor'' acceptable to employees, as opposed to a speculator interested in short-term gain Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock, which shot to record highs Thursday on signs that potential suitors were preparing for a bidding war, rose even higher Friday. The stock closed at $ 105 -LRB- a share, up -RRB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> confirmed Thursday that it was working on a proposal with <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who leads a group holding 4.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock. Bankers Trust Senior Vice President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> said the firm is prepared to advise <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and arrange financing, including an equity stake of its own. <PERSON> Parisi </PERSON> said details of a financing package have yet to be arranged. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a financial analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hopwood </PERSON>, said stock traders also were intrigued by signs that another apparent suitor may be preparing an offer. The company, leveraged buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, reportedly has affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and apparently sold a large block of stock Wednesday in Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, netting a $ 19 million profit. In another development Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> and the leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 5,000-member pilots union said the unsettled labor contract covering the pilots remains a major wild card in the takeover battle. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Faupel </PERSON>, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also confirmed that they had been approached by four potential suitors: <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>; <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who started the bidding March 30; <ORGANIZATION> Kelso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm; and <ORGANIZATION> Wesray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm founded by former treasury secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. But they said all four broke off contact after <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> announced its ground rules. In a separate interview, <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> reiterated that the open labor contract is scaring off friendly bidders who do n't want to buy or invest in an airline with excessive wage costs or labor trouble. The company and the pilots continued their contract talks Friday, according to another <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, who said he had no immediate word on whether progress had been made.
